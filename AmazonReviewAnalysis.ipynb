It's science fiction written in the vocabulary of fantasy.  Basically, settlers on an alien world, using advanced technology, create a world corresponding to Hindu mythology, with members of the crew taking on the aspects and powers of Hindu deities.  There is even a means of electronically providing for reincarnation.  The battles between the gods are epic and the verbal depictions are as good as a mural.  The ending is also some of Zelazny's most touching writing, without ever dipping into the maudlin.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>learned alot</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is a biography for kids on Jackie Robinson.

He took the bad and pushed it aside and became a better person and player!   The book was not too long and not too short. It contained the right amount of information for kids. I would recommend this book to kids who are learning about the Jackie Robinson. I learned a lot from reading this book.  He is a great role model for kids today.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>\"What it takes to survive,\"</td><td>5.0</td><td>The old saying that \"no good deed goes unpunished\" is proven once again in Laura Lippman's new Tess Monaghan novel.  Tess is a Baltimore-based private investigator and former reporter who lives in harmony with her boyfriend, Edgar \"Crow\" Ransome, until Crow unexpectedly brings home a troubled teenager named Lloyd Jupiter.  Crow is a soft touch and a do-gooder, and even after Lloyd perpetrates a scam on Crow, the kindhearted man decides to give the hungry and homeless boy a decent meal and a roof over his head.  Tess is less than thrilled with this arrangement, and she is even more ticked off when Lloyd leaves in the middle of the night, planning to steal her laptop, digital camera, Lexus SUV, and other assorted items.  Although Lloyd's scheme doesn't play out exactly as planned, he manages to get away and promptly disappears into the streets of Baltimore. As it turns out, Lloyd may possess key information about the unsolved murder of Gregory Youssef, an Assistant United States Attorney who disappeared and was later found dead after having been stabbed dozens of times.  Since he had been assigned to antiterrorism cases and had also prosecuted drug cases, the authorities assumed that Youssef must have been kidnapped and killed by one of the many enemies he made as a prosecutor.  However, the murder remains unsolved and soon fades from the headlines.  Later, rumors began to surface that Youssef may have been involved in a gay love tryst gone bad.  This does not sit well with Youssef's wife, who rejects the idea as absurd.  However, on the night that Lloyd stays in her home, Tess notices that when Youssef's name comes up in passing, the young man apparently recognizes it and appears very frightened and guilt-ridden. \"No Good Deeds\" is a well-crafted story that seamlessly combines a number of themes:  the plight of homeless and neglected children, the corrosive nature of police corruption, and the manner in which secrets and lies destroy relationships and lives.  The characters are varied, lively, and well delineated.  They include Gabe Delasio, a shallow and ambitious Assistant United States Attorney who desperately wants to climb through the ranks, Barry Jenkins, a washed up FBI agent, and Mike \"Bully\" Collins, a tough-as-nails African-American DEA agent who is bitter about having been hung out to dry after he shot a civilian during a drug bust.  Each of these men has his own agenda, and when all three join forces to nail Tess and Crow, the two wind up in grave danger. As always, Monaghan brings her native Baltimore to life, with its beauty and ugliness as well as its tranquility and violence, and there are also evocative and atmospheric scenes at the Delaware shore. Lippman's descriptive writing and dialogue are as sharp as ever, and she skillfully integrates the many disparate elements of her intricate plot into a satisfying whole.  Lippman does what few suspense writers have the ability to accomplish.  She creates intriguing scenarios with recognizable people whose back stories make their behavior, if not commendable, at least understandable.  The best mysteries are never formulaic whodunits, but fully realized novels, and \"No Good Deeds\" continues the fine Lippman tradition of respecting her audience's intelligence enough to avoid predictable and hackneyed writing in favor of complex and riveting storytelling.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Copied from a whiteboard in a 1980's Howard Johnson?</td><td>2.0</td><td>Don't normally write book reviews but the existing reviews were so far off base, I couldn't stay silent. First of all the book painfully shows its age being written in 1986 when all the business \"gurus\" were touting the success of McDonalds, Coke and IBM as their own.  These references were outdated even then.  I thought that \"revisited\" (1995 publish date) might include a reference to the internet at least, but I was wrong. The book feels like a 268 page infomercial for the author's consulting company.  Once per chapter you can count on:  \"we at GERBER Corp\" have the answer to this problem. We'll give an overgeneralized and useless thumbnail of the solution here, in the hopes that you might become a client\" I appreciate the attempt at allegorical style, but it is poorly done.  I don't believe for a minute that there ever was a conversation with a \"Sarah\" that runs through the book.  With this obvious falsification, the author loses authenticity. Obviously the author is a career consultant and it is painfully obvious: for example the points he makes are always bunched in threes. (because thats the only way stupid people comprehend at hotel seminars)  Well what if the discoveries take you in a direction that leads to 5 or 13 points of knowledge? There is no hard data, empirical evidence, test results, or original knowledge - just anecdotes and the author's unsupported claims, likely culled from a morass of 1970s business books and spun into a different yarn. Despite all this, there are some interesting points raised about the qualities needed for starting a business being different from those to run it.  Some colorful descriptions here and there which elevate it to two stars bordering on three. In summary: If you want to grow a business larger than a mom and pop and stay profitable over time, you must build systems and processes.  The author thinks a lot of small business owners don't know this.  If you do know this, move on.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>I heard colleagues recommend \"The E-Myth Revisited\" time and time again</td><td>5.0</td><td>When I ran a small photography business, I heard colleagues recommend \"The E-Myth Revisited\" time and time again. Yet, years went by, I closed my business due to low revenue, and still, I had not read the book. Until this past week, when I remembered that the book was collecting dust under my bed. I got down on my hands and knees to fish it out and give it a read. I could not put it down. This book has forever changed how I view business, whether it's a small one-person shop or a large Fortune 500 corporation. My favorite concept in the book is the idea of building a prototype. Imagine you are looking to franchise your business. You need to create the structure and systems so that anyone could buy the franchise and successfully run the business. Create an organization chart with the various positions that are necessary for your business to run (e.g. CEO, CFO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, etc.). Each of those positions needs defined responsibilities and expectations as well as an Operating Manual so that anyone could jump into that position and be successful. \"But wait,\" you say. \"I'm the only person who works in my business. This won't help me.\" Yes, it will. Instead of arriving at work and just \"getting to work,\" having distinct positions can help you be intentional about your time. Instead of running around haggard only to feel like you got nothing done at the end of the day, you will intentionally put on the appropriate \"hat\" and work on a specific goal before moving on. Why did my photography business close up shop? Because I never wore my marketing hat and would only wear my CFO hat when I scrambled to find documents for taxes. I never wore my CEO hat and took the time to strategically plan the trajectory of my business. The only hat I wore was that of a photographer, assuming that if my pictures were good enough, they would sell themselves. So I spent all of my time and money focused on that vague goal. I worked 50-60 hours every week, often with nothing to show by the end of the week. As Zig Ziglar said, If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time. Having defined roles in a one-person business aids with focus. As you hire people, they can step into these defined roles to lighten your load. With clearly stated goals, responsibilities and expectations, you are giving a new employee the tools to succeed. This concept applies to any type of organization, even at a volunteer level. I've been thinking about setting up a playgroup for my son to get some play time and for me to network with other parents and make friends. My first thought was to run head first and immediately schedule events. But after reading \"The E-Myth,\" I've realized I should first create defined positions, even if I serve in every position at the beginning. It gives other parents the opportunity to step up and host activities that suit their interests. By having set positions and defined expectations for each position, the group can grow to a point of having several events per week without me feeling frazzled and overbooked. I would recommend this book to anyone who leads a business or organization. Seriously. No need for years to pass and you to go out of business before reading it. :) It could completely shatter and rebuild how you define and operate a business.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>EXCELLENT BOOK FOR ALL LEVELS OF COOKS</td><td>5.0</td><td>Not suprisingly, Donna Hay has done it again.

It is excellent.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Really superior fantasy adventure</td><td>5.0</td><td>Lord Ingrey kin Wolfcliff knows about animal possession. Still, when he arrives at the deathscene of a prince, he is shocked to find the accused killer to be a beautiful woman--who happens to be possessed by a leopard. It's his duty to bring Lady Ijada to the capital where, perhaps, she can find justice. But some compulsion, almost impossible to resist, is urging him to kill her at once. A very different compulsion draws him to her. In a meeting with a priestess, the wolf that dwells within Ingrey becomes active--opening his eyes to the magic that is around him and hinting at one of the ancient heresies--that animal-ridden people have a special path to the deities. But Ingrey and Ijada are not the only people with the forbidden animal inhabitation. Ingrey's cousin, Earl Horseriver, seems inhabited by a stalion--and something more. Whether that something more is good or evil, Ingrey has a hard time determining. Author Lois McMaster Bujold combines fascinating world-building, intriguing and multi-dimensional characters, and plenty of magic and action to deliver a truly superior fantasy. Bujold explains the history of the tortured land, and then weaves that history into the present, and into the task that Ingrey and Ijada must fulfil. THE HALLOWED HUNT is set in the same world as Bujold's earlier (and excellent) CURSE OF CHALION and PALADIN OF SOULS. Although I enjoyed the earlier books, I think HUNT surpasses even those.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Whodunit</td><td>2.0</td><td>Ok story, wasn't as funny as I'd hoped.

Billy Pilgrim is a character that you won't soon forget. The gruesome war that made him the way he is becomes the central force of the novel as all of Billy's experiences are seen through the prism of his witnessing the bombing of Dresden at the conclusion of WWII. In his mind, he travels through time, inventing an alter life in wihich he escapes from Earth, but perhaps the novel's most clear theme is the innescapable nature of war memories. They will even follow you to other worlds. The language can be rough at times, so I can't recommend this book to younger readers, but for adults, it's worth reading and contemplating on why we wage war with one another. In my opinion, this bests \"Catch-22\" as the ultimate anti-war statement in contemporary literature.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>The best Israeli love story ever</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is an absolutely wonderful novel.  The love story itself is beautiful and real.  And the political subtext conveys perfectly what the situation in Israel is today.  For anyone who cares about Israel, this will make a painful read. For me, it made me all the more determined to strengthen the wonderful people in Israel (the peace activists) who are trying so hard to save Israel (and the Palestinians) from the current nightmare.  If you care about Israel, read this book and learn.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Beautiful Person Battles Her Physical and Psychic Scars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Lucy Grealy writes poignantly and poetically about the way her battles with cancer of the jaw have affected her life since childhood.  This autobiography chronicles her surgeries, struggles, denial and, finally, acceptance of herself as the mirror of her face.  Facing things might be an apt metaphor here. The metaphor of face, along with her identification of self as she deals with the ravages wrought on her face, are examined from many different vantage points. At first, Ms. Grealy is in denial that she has become different looking.  She then avoids any acknowledgment  of how she's changed post-surgeries. The story shows no self-pity.  Rather, she shares the evolution of her life, family, and growing self-awareness in a chronology of events marked by treatments and surgeries.  This is a beautiful book!!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>It had Potential...</td><td>1.0</td><td>Avoid this book like the plague. This book was the freshman book for my undergraduate education.  It had potential, but meeting the author ruined it.  She came and spoke and we were required to go.  So several hundred college freshmen got to sit there, in early 2002, and listen to a woman describe having cocktails with her friends and watching the World Trade Centers fall.  She said they talked about \"How New York was always changing.\"  In a lunch she had with a few contest \"winners\" she talked about how she was being paid to write a book on med school, but wasn't being paid as much as a man who actually went to all the classes. Overall her story had the potential to be inspiring, she lived through a horrible illness and beat horrible odds.  Her story could have been inspiring and brought hope to others who are in the process of battling cancer.  But she never grew beyond being a child.  I guess I could write it all off as just being human, but it went beyond that.  She seemed to see no one outside of herself.  Overall, she was a sad woman who never got beyond her personal pain.  By the time she left our school I think most of us really pittied her.  She had huge potential to be a survivor, but she dropped the ball.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Grealy's memoir is exquisite.</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am reviewing a book, not a person, not what happened to this dear, tragic, fellow human being. I believe Lucy (and no, I did not know her personally) would want me and other reviewers to review her story and her words. Like Van Gogh, people cannot always separate the work from its tortured artist's soul. And yet, does the work not deserve to be seen and appreciated?  Grealy's phenomenal memoir, Autobiography of a Face is not easy to read. It is never easy to read the tragedies of a child and honest, heartbreaking words. Her story evokes much, much more than sympathy. Her prose is no less than exquisite. Not all of us read to simply be entertained. This tender book is much more than that and has something very important to teach us.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>You must see the butterfly needle...</td><td>4.0</td><td>Superbly written, Ms. Grealy's book does not spare us the rawness of her struggles, both in the descriptions of the medical procedures and the recountings of the taunts and jeers of her male peers. At times I felt Lucy had the same condescension for the reader as she had for her jeering peers. She pulled us in so that we had sympathy no matter how much her words and tone insisted she did not want sympathy. Then she would abruptly turn and show us the ugliness of disease, as if to say, \"Here, you will look. I will not let you turn away.\" Particularly jarring was the chapter ironically entitled \"The Petting Zoo.\" A visit to the animal research lab gives us a literal and metaphorical glimpse of the truths a very young Lucy had to face. I could not find Lucy lovable, but I was awed by her tremendous courage and her poignant humanity. I was glad she did not let us turn away.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Definitely Able to Evoke Emotion</td><td>4.0</td><td>What is the basis of a good book?  To me, one that can evoke emotion...good or bad. This book, although I found the author a bit unlikeable, was able to touch a nerve in me that made me think.  I felt lucky to be who I was and never meet the misfortune of going through what Lucy went through.  I felt priviledged to grow up in the family that I did.  I was grateful God gave me the face that he did. However, I found Lucy to be heartless and unlikeable.  She was not grateful for anything in her life and she was constantly feeling sorry for her own state.  Hell, who wouldn't?  Does this make me feel guilty to say this?  Sure.  But don't we all want to see people rise above their negative fates?  To turn it around into a positive?  Yes.  Because what that does is it enables us to take our struggles (though not as difficult as Lucy's, I'm sure) and figure out a way to come out a better person.  I am not convinced Lucy was able to do this. I understand Lucy died of a heroin overdose after the book was published.  I wish that she had become a motivational speaker, a Big Sister, a psychotherapist for effected children.  Instead, her demise proved her to be someone who didn't rise above.  May she rest in peace.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>excellent and thoughtful</td><td>5.0</td><td>Although it is true, according to so many who knew Lucy Grealy, that she is spoiled and selfish, it is also true that this book is excellent and thoughtfully written. Most memoirs most likely leave certain elements out or elaborate others. In Grealy's case, though, she left behind so many people who really had bad personal experiences with her, that there are a lot of people to dispute or criticize her, as well. That said, even if she was a selfish and spoiled woman, this book is STILL good. It is easy to see, with what she went through, why she became so needy.  At such a young age, her self-image was distorted.  I think anyone who went through that would be the same. I'm reminded, now, of Frances Kuffel's \"Passing for Thin\".  The criticism of that book was similar to this.  She grew up terribly obese, taunted and teased also.  And, she had to relearn things the rest of us take for granted when she grew up.  Grealy learned everything through such negative experiences, also. Lucy Grealy considered herself a poet first, then a memoirist.  Her memoir reads like poetry and the words she chooses to use serve her well. After reading this, I read Ann Patchett's \"Truth and Beauty\" to get a fuller picture of Grealy.  Ann's book talked about many things that Grealy's left out.  Some reviewers seemed to find this troublesome.  I don't think that is the point, however.  Grealy shared with us her thoughts and feelings, not Ann Patchett's.  Sometimes they were contradictory to Patchett's. Sometimes they were contradictory to her own thoughts at different times. This doesn't make them false; it makes her more real.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Some Self-Insight But Not Enough</td><td>3.0</td><td>I wasn't carried away by her writing, nor the content particularly. I kept reading in the hopes that things would get better, that someone would finally realize Lucy's worth (perhaps herself) or that one single doctor would come up with a cure-all for her facial disfigurement. However, I was disappointed. Ms. Grealy left a lot of questions unanswered. Her mother \"had\" to leave her job that she had had for many years. Why? Her father died of pancreatitis - how did he develop that? Did he drink? Ms. Grealy admits that she was very detached about her father's death - and so too, it seemed was her twin sister. Was the sister identical? We are not told. Ms. Grealy may discuss things once (such as her relationship to school friends after her operation), then never mention these friends again. She states that her brother later developed schizophrenia, but doesn't talk about him, or any of her family members in any depth. They are not important characters. Basically, this book is all about her feelings about her face and how other people judge her (so she thinks)on her looks. Why does she care what they think? She seems not to worry about packing up and moving anywhere, so she is confident enough for that. She is given a generous scholarship to Sarah Lawrence, although she previously mentioned that she was a \"mediocre\" student. She moves to Iowa, she moves to Germany, she moves to England, she moves to Scotland. She receives many free reconstructive surgeries(or so she says), all the while not working a full-time job, or even a part-time job most of the time. She partied, she had friends. Ms. Grealy does not seem thankful for any of this, she is too busy wallowing in her self-pity.  Ms. Grealy seemed to pick and choose what she wanted the reader to know. I'm now reading Truth and Beauty by Ann Patchett. I'm only on the third chapter, but already know more than this book let on.  Ms. Grealy did suffer through awful surgeries, 2 1/2 years of radiation and chemotherapy (Although Truth and Beauty says 5 years - that would be a bit much), many horrible experiences in the hospital by nurses and butchering doctors who just didn't give a damn, and immature bozos in her school. They should be shot - and where in the world was her twin sister during all of this? Lucy speaks as if she were completely alone in school, so alone that she had to eat her lunch in the counselor's office so that these cruel boys couldn't attack her.  I hate that she felt so badly about herself. But she just couldn't let it go. I wish that Lucy Greely had found a good therapist and increased her self-esteem, taken her focus off her face and decided to concentrate on others who needed her. Her book really leaves me wondering what kind of person she would have been had she not had the disfigurement. I really get the feeling that she wanted others to care about her, but she didn't really care too much for anyone else.  This book could have been fleshed out quite a bit more to explain Lucy's experiences in life.  As it is written, it seems very one-dimensional. The only thing I can say is perhaps this book will be a lesson to us to be grateful for what we have, and to have more compassion and empathy for others and ourselves.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Has Ben Mezrich ever been to Japan?</td><td>1.0</td><td>I have seen Ben Mezrich praised by critics for his wealth of details. He certainly has plenty of details about Japan in Ugly Americans. The problem is: they're all wrong. It starts on the first page, with littered sidewalks, steel-grated doors and broken milk crates, none of which you are ever likely to see in the back streets of Kabuki-cho. It doesn't have sidewalks, or steel-grated doors, or milk crates lying around. I think Mezrich is confusing Tokyo with Manhattan or Boston, where he apparently lives. Every page contains mistakes of some kind. The hero gets a big motorcycle and goes riding. Despite being on a gravel road, he leans over 'almost parallel to the ground,' a manoeuvre which would be fatal for any other rider on the planet. As he rides at 150 kilometers an hour on said gravel road, he experiences 'the acrid smell of burning rubber' and 'cool air mixed with gasoline fumes.' Not only does Mezrich sound as if he's never been to Japan, I also doubt that he's ever been on a motorcycle. You don't get burning rubber just from going fast, and you wouldn't be able to smell either it or the 'gasoline fumes' anyway. The thing about going fast is that you leave everything, including and especially smells, behind you. Mezrich also has the obligatory earthquake, which causes his hero to lift up the window of his new apartment (it would be a horizontally sliding window in Japan) and climb out onto the fire escape (outside fire escapes on apartment buildings in Japan never go past someone's window), etc. And, of course, he has the inevitable appearance of yakuza, the daughter of one of whom falls for our hero. The idea that the proprietor, yakuza or otherwise, of a hostess bar in Roppongi would have his beautiful young daughter working there, dealing with the customers, is ludicrous. And what is the reason for the fascination that non-Japanese have for the yakuza? Do they think some of that hard-man mystique will rub off on themselves if they claim some acquaintance? I don't know anything about the real 'John Malcolm' or the hedge fund business. There are, however, so many details about Japan and Japanese people wrong on every page that I wonder whether anything in the book is accurate. Mezrich should have stuck to writing novels, where 'imagination' is more acceptable.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Sad story.........</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is a very sad compelling story.

This book was still \"in production\" (for lack of a better phrase) at the time of his death and it is all too apparent in the pages of O'HARA'S CHOICE; the characters are sparsely written, intense detail is uneven though the story and the overall \"theme\" of the novel-- a critical moment after the Civil War in the history of the Marine Corps-- is spotty and sometimes taken for granted. Still and all, Uris utilized his stock characters: the handsome and idealistic young man, the headstrong yet confused young woman. What I have loved about his novels over the years is how the more minor figures in the plots of his books have seemed entirely three dimentional and integral to the line of the story; yet in this novel the more minor characters are restricted to the corners of the tale. Bearing all this in mind, for any strong Leon Uris fan i would still recommend this book (just wait until it's in paperback). that it was his last novel which he was working on at the time of his death makes it all the more poignant and though i personally do not care for this book, i am happy to have read it and make it a part of my Uris collection and my respect for him and his work shall continue.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>'..and on and on..'</td><td>2.0</td><td>Bright yet shallow, slight but interminable, couched in borderline remedial English, this witless fable failed to float my boat.

Between its tired Anne Frank epigraph and its preachy tone ('Yet again I trot on stage the only real villain in my story; the oversize human brain') this contrives to be both corny and sententious. Shame; back in the day Titan was a game-changer - but that was absurdism, as I recall, not tubthumping I just found the reference.

Now that I've read it I'd say the negative reviews are too picky. This is a great book. IMO, this seems to read faster than the prior two, so you might think it's 'lighter' or less complex.  Perhaps, but it has a well-developed set of characters, plenty of plot turns to keep you interested, yet with smooth reading.  I liked how these characters and the issues they were facing were put into the same universe as the prior 2 books, yet they were separate enough to be different and interesting.

This is the 13th posthumous work to come from the Buk since his death and it's subtitled \"new poems.\" The Buk never claimed to be the best person, the best lover, the best writer, the best anything; although I'm sure that at different times and with plenty of beer in him he put forward some extravagant claims of other kinds. I love him, and many, many regular people who feel similarly do so because, I think, he was honest, unsentimental and a great lover of humanity in his poems--even when he is castigating humanity for its ugliness. It's precisely this breadth, which I would call Whitmanesque in its strange multiplicity, that continues to amaze. These are far from his best poems, but there are some gems in here. Bukowski was the kind of poet of which there were and are few to none--a populist who wanted to be left alone, a lonely man who wasn't alone, a craftsman of the finest stamp, somebody who, like Hemingway, got the true words down on paper and knew how to leave it there. There are poems here about the usual Buk concerns: Women, drinking, the track, love, impending death, other writers, fame, bars, working horrible jobs, starving, starving, drinking and writing in boardinghouses; his close and unforgiving (yet deeply sympathetic) portraits of other people trying to push the dharma wheel a few inches forward, usually failing. I won't attempt to do any lit crit pronouncements on this book. It's something to read alone and laugh with, to read openly with other people, to cherish, to keep the fire alive. There's an existential commitment to meaning here, the meaning one places on one's own actions, decisions, follies, joys, tears, life and death.

Nick Leeson told his own story far better in 'Rogue Trader'.

What I normally do before reading a book is to sort these Amazon reviews by \"Lowest Rating First\" and see if there's an underlying trend which might indicate an actual bad book.  Doing that here gave me enough of a bad feeling that I worried about the book.  But, since the wife wanted to read it, we got it from the library.  I read it before she could get around to it [g].  Anyway, I was extremely relieved that I found the book to be excellent.  I found myself darn near as engrossed as I did while reading \"Curse of Chalion.\"  Since it included far more of the political-level and more development of the characters than did \"Paladin of Souls\" (and no convenient enemy invasions), I thought is was better than that book.  If I had to stretch to find something bad to say about the book, the worst I could come up with is 1) the antogonist is more cypher than villain and 2) it would have been nice if Bujold had used SOMETHING from the other two books besides the basic premise of the religion.  Other than that, the book is excellent.  I felt it to be nicely paced and, like the others, highly emotionally satisfying.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A good read, but with some low spots...</td><td>4.0</td><td>I haven't read the other Chalion books: this is my first Bujold book and so I can't comment on the relative quality of this entry into the \"series\"... but in terms of absolute quality, I really liked this book and am happy (gleeful) to report I have a new author I can look for. Hallowed Hunt is a completely independent book. You need not read the other entries into the series to appreciate it, although some background gets short shrift. The opening premise is stunning, well-executed, and draws you into the book to see where Bujold is going to go with it. The ending is also pretty darned good, making the book well worth the read. It's the middle that drags. The characters are a bit flat (more dimension than most \"epic fantasy\", but not good enough to carry a couple of hundred pages by themselves). A good bit of the front half of the book is just setting the pieces up and the action is somewhat contained. Nonetheless, this is one of the better fantasies I've read recently and a good step up from most of the over-long junk that lines the shelves of the local megastore. Recommended, although I suspect the other books in this series are better.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Promising....Then Falls Flat</td><td>2.0</td><td>Having always heard great things about Uris's writing I was excited to read this work about the US Marine Corps.

I have the impression that Bujold has breaks during her writing and did not get all her thoughts together on this book. The beginning of the story is intriguing and promising and the ending highly imaginative. It is a pity that the in-betweens are at times slow and disjointed.

The author, Debi Unger, seems to have not done her homework on George Marshall. I just felt she had missed the boat on giving him the credit he was due for his role as Chief of Staff for the War Department and Secretary of State after the war. He handled many difficult tasks extremely well in both roles which she did not seem to grasp as well as I thought she should have. He was the kind of man who was a great administrator  and who surrounded himself with the very best at what they did and then let them do their jobs without interfering, especially in the case of General Eisenhower, he trusted him enough to let him be the Supreme Commander in the E.T.O., staying out of Eisenhower's way and letting him do his job, which he did well and which made George Marshall look good in the process.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>George Marshall: A Biography</td><td>1.0</td><td>George C. Marshall is one of only a handful of U.S. Army officers to rise to five star rank. He served as Chief of Staff throughout the Second World War and then became Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and a Nobel Prize winner. Readers of this book will probably be left wondering how he did it. The authors lose no opportunity  to denigrate and belittle General Marshall. I don't find their reasoning in the least bit convincing. Marshall led the army as the United States in essence fought two world wars simultaneously, defeating two deadly enemies in less than four years. I don't think he accomplished this by dithering, wavering, and routinely making poor decisions.  Marshall ended his career with the warm approbation of some of the finest military and political leaders of his era. - I am reminded of Stimson's remark that George Marshall was the finest soldier he had ever known. The book did have one good effect. I am off to the library today to look for other biographies of General Marshall.. I certainly cannot recommend this one.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>If only it was longer. . .</td><td>4.0</td><td>Lady Whistledown Strikes Back is for the most part a well written collection of stories.  My main quibble is that the stories were not developed as much as I wanted - but that is to be expected in short stories. The first story, Julia Quinn's, begins at Lady Neely's dinner party where Lady N's ruby bracelete gets stolen.  This is the thread that twines the stories together as all four of the couples are somehow linked to the bracelet.  As such, it is probably best to read the stories in order so as not to spoil the ending. I bought the book mostly because I like Julia Quinn.  Her story of a girl falling in love with her dead brother's best friend was entirely believable and surprisingly well developed for such a short story.  (I do have to say that I noticed a trend of dead brothers in this anthology, a fact which I find slightly disconcerting) The second story (by Mia Ryan) is the reason I knocked a star off the total.  Her story about an earl falling in love with his party planner felt forced and cliched.  Every time something implausible happened (approx every 30 seconds) I would groan and bang my hand against the wall.  Needless to say by the end my neighbors were quite annoyed with me.  Let me give an example from the book: during one of their meetings the heroine tells the earl that she knew from their first meeting that he was a perfect gentleman (never mind that on their first meeting the earl had mistaken her for his paramour - who was conveniently forgotten during the rest of the story - and basically fondled her behind and kissed her).  But it wasn't all bad - Lady W's commentary provided some much needed entertainment. The third story was a surprising gem (considering I hadn't read anything of Enoch's before), possibly my favorite.  A proper girl falls in love with a man her parents dissaprove of, forcing them to court in secret.  Wonderfully written, although I would have liked a little more closure. The final story was of a different formula than the first three (in which rake met girl of dreams and had a miraculous reformation of character).  A viscount returns home to his wife, after 12 years away, after she writes demanding an annulment.  Very humorous and full of the witty banter one expects from Karen Hawkins.  Unlike the other stories there was even a very likeable secondary character, in the form of the heroine's brother. The bottom line:  It's a well-written anthology worth having on your shelf, but unless you have plenty of spare time you don't mind wasting skip the second story.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Ok read</td><td>3.0</td><td>All of the stories were ok reading but they all lacked one thing (LOVE SCENES).

His prospects are not that good, being the second son of a minor baron, he is in London to find a suitable bride with a relatively good dowry.  As it happens he is at the most sought after dinner party put on by Lady Greely, he comes face to face with Lady Mathilde `Tilly' Howard, sister of his best friend Harry who didn't survive.  He knew by her close resemblance to Harry who she was without being introduced, but more than that he was attracted by her sincere and sweet manner. Knowing that she was daughter of an Earl and an heiress to boot he knew he'd have to look elsewhere or be labeled a fortune hunter.  Tilly attracted as she was by this handsome, intelligent and honorable hunk thought to change his mind!  Totally charming, very cute and funny  - 5* The LAST TEMPTATION - Mia Ryan  ---  Isabella `Bella' Martin has been Lady Greely's companion and party planner for the last ten years and has been quite adept at hiding in the shadows. A spinster fast approaching her 30th birthday and never been kissed which she vows to change before that fateful birthday.  Lord Anthony Roxbury, 37 and heir to the Earldom has no intention to marry in spite of the weekly sessions with his father continually stressing the reasons why it is his duty to marry and procreate. Having too much fun it is the last thing on his mind until he mistakes Bella for one of his assignations and she not only gets a kiss but a relatively nice grope before she shockingly rears back and almost breaks his nose.  Through the blood and the apologies, Anthony discovers that this very self deprecating spinster is a breath of fresh air and decides he must see more (and more) of her.  Wonderfully romantic -  5* The BEST OF BOTH WORLDS - Suzanne Enoch ---  Charlotte Birling is allowed no chance at all of ever being mentioned in Lady Whistledown's column, ever since she was seven and her cousin had married in haste and then been deserted by Lord Easterly.  But a girl could dream and the dream rode by her house every morning on his way to Gentlemen Jacksons.  Her dream was the very handsome Earl Xavier Matson who since coming to town was making a name for himself with his womanizing exploits.  When Xavier chances to overhear Charlotte at a function standing up against Lady Greely for accusing someone of stealing her bracelet without so much as a shred of evidence, Xavier is intrigued.  No. she might have been plaine and  she certainly wasn't the type he'd been pursuing in a search for a wife but there was something about her that did kindle his interest - an interest that Lord and Lady Birling were adamant of nipping in the bud.  - But alas, we all know that love will win out!  -  Totally awesome for such a short novella!  5* The ONLY ONE FOR ME - Karen Hawkins --- Sophia (cousin of Charlotte Birling Throckmorton Hampton, Viscountess Easterly was abandoned by her husband Max, the Viscount Easterly twelve years earlier.  Abandoned after she failed to show him support when he was accused of cheating. Max's pride would not allow him to deny what he felt was an insult to his honor. On their brother Richard's deathbed, Sophia and her brother John Throckmorton, Earl of Standwick would discover that Richard was the real culprit who allowed Max to shoulder the blame.  After not seeing him for 12 years other than missives from his solicitor, Max showed up at Lady Greely's shocking Sophia.  His mere presence was all it took to re-ignite the passion both held for each other. When the blame for the theft of Lady Greely's bracelet threatened to implicate Max, Sophia was determined to discover the real culprit, if only to atone for her lack of faith that caused him to walk away so many years ago - but also - could it be she still cared!!!  Sweetly endearing, snappy dialog and a lot of sensual teasing....  5* OVERALL - In this sparkling anthology, these marvelous authors all picked up a thread on the mystery of the missing bracelet to blend them all into one full length story with several sub-plots each with its own delightful romance. Although it would be hard to pick my favorite, I think it would be Enoch's story with Charlotte solving the problem of her parents objections of Earl Matson so very cleverly in front of the guests at the ball!  This is not to say that they were not all delightful - just my personal favorite!

Fortunately, this varied collection - Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories - offers an easier way to become acquainted with Mann's intellectual, psychologically complex literature. Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures markedly complicate the task of translation. H. T. Lowe-Porter's translation is considered the most accessible version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's sentences. (For comparison with an excellent literal version, look at Stanley Appelbaum's translation of Death in Venice, Dover Publications, 1995). Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories was first published by Vintage Books in 1954. My edition was printed by Vintage International in 1989; it has neither an introduction nor explanatory notes. Death in Venice (1911):  While vacationing in Venice, the aging, highly respected author Gustave Ashenbach becomes mesmerized by a young boy staying at the seashore with his Polish aristocratic family. Although intellectually aware of his growing obsession, Ashenbach is unable to break away.  This somber portrayal of a troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances that illustrates Thomas Mann's ability to create layers of meaning. Tonio Kroger (1903) is perhaps more biographical as it explores a writer's internal conflict between his desire to be accepted, that is to fit in to a bourgeois life, and his contradictory need to follow his artistic temperament wherever it might lead him. Mario and the Magician (1929) is more explicitly political, depicting in the guise of an unscrupulous hypnotist a Mussolini-like character. The ending of this intriguing account is a surprise. The setting in Disorder and Early Sorrow (1925) is Munich, less than a decade after World War I, amid rampant inflation and social upheaval. The narrator, Professor Cornelius, is saddened by the loss of tradition, exemplified by modern art, music, and dance forms so popular with his older children, now young adults. He finds refuge in his study of history. Early sorrow refers to an incident involving his five year-old daughter, Ellie. A Man and His Dog (1918) is personal, humorous, and almost idyllic, quite different from the more serious topics addressed in the other stories in this collection. The Blood of the Walsungs (1905) is the most disturbing story in this collection. The two key characters exhibit an aristocratic arrogance and elitism that culminates in incest. In an opera scene Mann draws a close parallel between his two protagonists and Siegmund and Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walkure. Tristan (1902) has been described as a retelling of the legend of Tristan and Isolde set in a sanatorium. Detlev Spinell, a tuberculosis patient staying in the Dr. Leander's medical facility, becomes infatuated with another patient, Herr Kloterjahn's wife. Spinell is a largely unsuccessful writer, one that has difficulty relating to others. In Felix Krull (1911) the narrator is a self-serving, unscrupulous, amoral, confidence man that is somehow likeable. The story ends abruptly, leaving the reader wondering what happens next.  Forty years later Thomas Mann resumed work on this story and in 1954 he published the novel The Confessions of Felix Krull, a light, often hilarious account of a man who wins the favor and love of others by enacting the roles that they desire of him. Thomas Mann was born in Germany in 1875. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929. He left Germany in 1933, living primarily in Switzerland and the United States until his death in 1955.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Excellent Translation in Dover Edition - Helpful Commentary</td><td>5.0</td><td>Death in Venice (1912) is a disturbing story, one that is not easy to forget. It is also exceptional literature, a classic of the twentieth century. Thomas Mann's Death in Venice might be best compared to the subtle, psychologically complex fiction of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. In Munich the aging, highly respected author Gustav Aschenbach is in need of change, rest in a new setting, to overcome his growing fatigue that is impacting his writing. While recovering in Venice, Aschenbach slowly, but inexorably, becomes mesmerized by a young Polish boy staying at the seashore with his aristocratic family. Aschenbach is intellectually aware of his growing obsession, but he is seemingly unable to break away. Thomas Mann's somber portrayal of this troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances and psychological intensity. Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures severely complicate the task of translating Death in Venice. I have read two excellent and yet substantially different translations. The most faithful translation is by Stanley Appelbaum (in this Dover edition, 1995) that tries to be as literal as possible, carefully preserving the comparative length of the original sentences as well as the internal sequence of each original German sentence. Contrastingly, the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation (found elsewhere) is less literal, but is considered the most delightful and readable version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's lengthy sentences. Lowe-Porter's version has been the standard translation for many years. The Dover edition provides an excellent 10-page commentary, including footnotes.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A 21st Century Facelift For a Classic (Ink Fresh But Dried)</td><td>5.0</td><td>I don't have much more to add to Grady Harp's effusive praise, except to say that I pretty much agree with his main points.  I first read the classic H.T. Lowe Porter translation in college and liked it then . . . anything for a thorough expose of what it means--or necessarily used to mean--to be gay and aging.  Even Lowe Porter's fusty Edwardian strains, imparting dignity and Olympian tragedy to the drama, seemed apt at the time for a life--in the middle of another pestilence--that seemed to offer no happy ending. But since then we've had Will and Grace and countless gay characters, mostly minor, in films and on TV--and one of the great things is that it's okay to laugh about it all.  Even at what we in the community used to call tragic and sometimes in our bitchier moments still do.  This translation invites us to smile, and even occasionally howl.  By giving Aschenbach an obsession with the Greek gods (toward the end he uses the words god and godlike about a dozen times in two pages), Mann not only shows us what was required at the time as a good alibi or cover for homosexual tendencies (not even \"identities\")--\"classical culture\" and \"noble classicism\" and so on: everything that involved nude boys and swimming hole frolics and attention served to youth and beauty in young beauties--but also gave us in the future (inadvertantly, I don't know, since I don't read German) the keys to understanding a period in which so-called bourgeois culture needed its literature and high art to justify the ancients' curious sexual habits.  An almost neurasthenic obsession with youth and health and beauty being an ironic side feature of cultured life. The result for Mann, in one instance, is a wonderfully dry scene in which the old writer goes to the barber and frowns at his \"pinched face\" in the mirror, thereby unleashing a torrent of rationales from the barber for working his own art on the aging artist: dye job, little curl here and there, rouge.  It's an astoundingly paced and worded moment, and what it leads up to is more dramatic and complex than I remembered in the most famous version.  It's not so much about loneliness and a necessarily tragic life, it turns out in this makeover, as about the way we hide ourselves, cloak ourselves, in the identities the world wants to see.  That's the tragedy Mann's getting at.  Now the yellowing lenses of post-Victorianism have been lifted to reveal this more clearly. So, three cheers for Michael Henry Heim--and five stars!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Stark Reality...</td><td>4.0</td><td>There are many books we've all read where the main character has endured many of the same things as are written about in Blue Suburbia.  For some reason, however, that those same circumstances are written in free verse seems to make them slap a reader upside the head with the reality of it all.  The language of Blue Suburbia is wonderfully sparse which, I think, emphasizes the actions...there are no flowery or minimizing adjectives or adverbs to take the sting out of the nouns and verbs.

In the end, Brother and Sister put Mama and Papa to bed then stay up to read books. The respect and obedience usually present in these stories is missing. In its place is whining, excuses and procrastination. I may have liked the book more, if I had bought it with different expectations. But with these loved characters, this story merely disappoints.

By the way, the conciseness is a great value of this little jewel. The most important thing in this narrative is the development of Gustav von Aschenbach, the protagonist. And Mann does succed in doing that. Once he was a famous writer that is now decadent. He goes to Venice, where he expects to have a great time and relax. Little did he know that he would find a great obsession that would bring up the worst in him. Aschenbach's passion and obsession is not the one we usually think of. There is not a sexual attraction to the teenager Tadzio, the protagonist is much more concerned on the beauty and its aesthetic rather than what we would call love. Mann's prose is slow going, but very beautiful what makes the book so worthwhile reading. His descriptions bring to the pages the best of Venice, and the more we appreciate the city, the less we like Aschenbach. His decadent story may be depressive, but it iluminates many issues --mostly the ones about love, beauty and obessession.

Four days later, Ms. Edwards was found brutally murdered, and Cook was immediately arrested for the crime.  In one of the worst examples of police and prosecutorial misconduct in American history, Kerry Max was put to trial with coached prosecutorial witnesses, bunk expert testimony about the \"age\" (six to twelve hours) of the fingerprint, and suppressed evidence that would have favored the defense.  The state declared that Kerry Max was a repressed homosexual (at a time when homosexuality was a mental illness, and in rural Texas, no less) who raped and butchered a female out of repressed rage - a theory, incredibly, they stuck to even during re-trials two decades later, in the 1990's! Chasing Justice is the story of the framing of Kerry Max by the Texas justice system.  The narrative was written in Kerry's own hand (1,200 pages at first draft) and condensed into a powerfully personal 350-page account of life on death row - desperation, abandonment, rape and sodomy, stabbings, and attempted suicide.  The prose isn't depressing; rather, Kerry Max just fights on, always waiting for the next turn, building his cadre of supporters.  Texas death row has been ruled in federal court to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Kerry Max fought for a full two decades for his freedom, through three outrageous trials, with not a penny to his name.  While the major Dallas newspaper was decrying the railroading of an innocent man, he was convicted again and again and again.  To date, he is still not eligible for reparations from the state of Texas because he has not been officially pardoned, which would require the unanimous concurrence several bureaucratic offices unwilling to admit their culpability in the grave trespass of justice against Kerry Max Cook.  (By the way, the state spent $5 - $7 million over two decades in their effort to execute Kerry Max). The reader will question - why Kerry Max?  In his book, the author does not devote his energies to answering why, rather, he uses his energy to fight.  From some brief research on the case, I have determined that the real culprit hired a very expensive, well-connected good ol' boy lawyer, requiring the police to find another suspect to satisfy the anger of the community.  I can only begin to wonder how the Texas justice system conspired for 20 years to keep an innocent man behind bars.  During each of his three trials, judges continually approved motions by the prosecutor and denied those of the defense, even to the point at which the court had contradicted itself on which evidence should be suppressed or allowed and for what reason! Kerry Max's remarkable story is a damning indictment of the death penalty and the Texas justice system.  Right before the publication of his memoir, national crime show Body of Evidence:  From the Case Files of Dayle Hinman featured forensic experts \"solving\" the Edwards murder based on false evidence from the prosecution.  Even 10 years have Kerry Max's exoneration in the national eye, misinformation is still being spread by those in power.  Kerry Max Cook's experiences should serve as clear warning not to blindly accept the word of authority.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Biography</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am very impressed with the \"Time For Kids\" series. I like how they bring biographical and non-fiction information to young children at a level that is appropriate for them to understand. The photos are great and they cover a wide variety of topics. I bought quite a number of them for my classroom.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of the greatest industrialists in modern business history</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is one in a series of inexpensive but superbly produced biographies created for younger readers (ages 7-9) that enable them to gain a much better understanding and appreciation of key figures throughout U.S. history, most of whom also had significant impact worldwide. That is certainly true of Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 - April 7, 1947) whose \"light, low-priced car with an up-to-date engine of ample horsepower, and built of the very best material [would eventually] put the world on wheels.\" Moreover, the Ford Motor Company shocked the business world when it announced (on January 5, 1914) that it would increase the wage of its workers to five dollars a day (almost twice what his and other auto companies had been paying) while reducing the work day from nine hours to eight. According to Ford, \"The five dollar day was the greatest cost-cutting move I ever made\" as company doubled its profits from $30-million in 1914 to $60-million two years later. How important is Henry Ford? It is difficult to think of another business leader who had a greater impact on his nation's economy, indeed on the societies and economies of other nations throughout the Americas, the UK, Europe, and Asia in which the dream of possessing an affordable automobile became a reality. Young people need to understand how Ford helped to develop \"a car for everyone,\" the subject of Chapter 5. They also need to understand how Ford's contributions helped to create \"a new middle class,\" the subject of Chapter 6. These and other subjects (e.g. the development of an interstate highway system as well as the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy and the consequent population shifts that substantially increased the population of metropolitan areas) are all worthy of additional study. Henry Ford was directly or at least indirectly involved in most of the major changes in \"the American way of life\" during the first half of the 20th century. He once observed, \"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\" Early in his life, he had several bold ambitions and was convinced that he could achieve all of them. More often than not, he was right. As is true of the other volumes in this series, this mini-biography is based on rock-solid historical material and includes a number of archival photos to supplement the lively narrative created by the Time editors in collaboration with Dina El Nabli. I feel obligated to add, that this is not a book written for younger \"dummies\" or \"idiots.\" It ought to be in all school and public libraries and would also be an excellent birthday or holiday gift for children, one that parents, grandparents, and other relatives should consider. Those who wish to learn more about Henry Ford are urged to check out his autobiography, My Life and Work, Steven Watts's The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century, The Fords: An American Epic co-authored by Peter Collier and David Horowitz, and Douglas G. Brinkley's Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Hated the cuss words</td><td>1.0</td><td>Loved the plot.

I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't yet read this book, but will say that someone you grow fond of (they became my favorite character) dies..... my copy of The High Lord is somewhat messed up now, because I was crying over it. Then again that may just be me. You may notice that despite all my criticism I have given The High Lord 5 stars. This is because although compared to the other two Black Magician books the High Lord (in my opinion) deserves 4 stars I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Compared to almost any other book it deserves 5 stars, so I gave them to it. (yes i know that's kind of confusing, but bear with me) All in all this was a great book for an even greater series, and I suggest everyone should read it. (After the other two of course.)

He serves his country in the way he knows best--by following orders and by killing those who are deemed a threat to the nation. When he's called back to headquarters, he knows this won't be a routine kill. Still, he's startled to learn that his next assignment is the man who brought him into E-1, the secret agency responsible for America's ultimate sanctions. Alex had trained him, inspired him, but now he's a threat to the country--and Luther knows how to follow orders. The only problem is, something about this particular job stinks. It doesn't take Luther long to realize that he's following a trail that Alex has carefully laid down. Alex is trying to teach Luther something, show him something about E-1 that would prove that the Agency has gone off-wire. Luther isn't buying, and even if he did, he's been assigned a job and he intends to complete it. Alex's trail takes him through the inner cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and finally Detroit--cities where drugs and guns cheapen life to the point where professional assassins fit right in. Alex's message is getting through, but Luther has sacrificed his entire life to his country and isn't about to be stopped. Only when the true coverup becomes known can Luther confront the real enemy. Author Gary Hardwick delivers an exciting story of assassination, martial arts action, and inner-city drama. Making Luther a black protagonist in a profession dominated by whites adds to the conflict--and heightens his sense of betrayal when the secrets are finally revealed. Hardwick's writing is occasionally clunky, but mostly workmanlike, moving the story along while deepening the reader's interest and buy-in to the characters. Overall, THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME is definitely worth the read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Great read</td><td>4.0</td><td>Great book!

I didn't get far but decided to give it another go after I heard they were going to make this into a TV series.  I once again didn't make it very far because I once again found it so all-over-the-place in terms of plot and I felt like skimming too much. I watched the first show in the series a few weeks ago and thought it was so good so I gave it another try and once again got stuck. Well, 4 episodes in I tried again and just finished the book a few minutes ago. I can say this may be the first time I have enjoyed the show more than the book. The show just makes more sense and actually added parts and I think the book would've benefited from those additions. I really hesitate to criticize this book too much because I am ordinarily such a fan of this genre and a fan of this author - I do very much like fantasy and mythology books but this book drifted too much and I found it plain confusing and I was tempted to skim sections in italics that would take us back in time to previous stories that seemed somewhat peripheral to the main action. Like I said, I am still a big fan of fantasy novels and have a stack of mythology books here at home, but for me personally, this novel didn't work.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Part stupid, part interesting</td><td>4.0</td><td>This was my second book by Mary Kay Andrews.  This first book I read was Savannah Blues which is the first in this short 2 book series.  I loved Savannah Blues and the Weezie character.  She made me root for her because she was so likable.  Likewise, getting to know BeBe in Weezie's book was great.  I loved the character and thought her own book would be interesting and so fun to read. However, the first 1/4 of the book was so unbelievable I wanted to scream.  First, her 2nd husband was sent to prison for looking at computer porn?  What?  That was so strange and odd.  No one goes to prison for looking at porn unless it's child pornography which the book did not state.  I didn't understand that whole concept.  Didn't the author do any research or were we suppose to believe it just because she said it?  Probably 80% of America would go to prison if you could get arrested for looking at computer porn. Then we are suppose to believe that a competent and very smart business woman who had been supporting herself and building her business for 15 or so years would just sign papers and hand everything over to some guy she just met?  Seriously?  I mean she had JUST met the guy.  She new him for all of what?  A week?  Someone that ignorant would not have been able to build up a business like she had.  I mean she had been married 3 times - she wasn't some wet behind the ears 20 year old.  If I had not paid $10 for the book, I probably would have stopped reading it right then.  Which would have been a shame because the rest of the book was well written, funny, interesting and fun to read. So I liked the last 3/4 of the book but the first 1/4 was stupid.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>This is a terrific new series</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've started reading this series after having gone through the Edgewater series.  \"The Oracle Betrayed\" already promises that this series will be much better and more satisfying.  The characters are well rounded, the dialogue is believable, and while there is a lot of action, it all flows together as part of an overarching plot, rather than as individual episodes.  This book will appeal to both girls and boys. Catherine Fisher does a great job of making the world of this story come to life.  The brutality of life in the ancient world is made evident.  As she describes the crowded city streets, details such as rotting garbage and the odor of dead animals make it extremely vivid and realistic.  And then this is contrasted with the sumptuous City of the Dead, where the high ranking inhabitants lack for nothing, even precious water while the poor are reeling from the effects of the long-lasting drought. The two main characters, Mireny and Seth, are flawed which makes them more believable than they would have been if they had been gung-ho, able-to-do-everything types.  Mireny is priestess but she doesn't believe the in the existence of her god, and by nature she is shy and uncomfortable around people.  Over the course of the book her faith changes and she gains confidence.  Seth begins as an arrogant scribe who gets drawn into the plot initially as a means of achieving his ambitions, but he too grows and his motives change. A previous reviewer complained that the meaning of everything is not spelled out at the beginning.  That's actually what makes for sophisticated storytelling, and makes this a book that will appeal to various ages.  As you read on the various layers of the the mystery are revealed and the various threads of the plot come together. For parents who are evaluating this book there are a couple of things to be aware of.  Although this is listed as book for 9 yr olds, it probably is more appropriate starting at 11 to 12 year olds due to some more mature elements.  There is a scene of ritual sacrifice, and while it is not graphic  it might be disturbing to some kids.  Also there is a brief scene that takes place in an opium den.  Otherwise I highly recommend this book.  It's enjoyable for anyone who enjoys a mix of mystery and fantasy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Hey, where did the end go!</td><td>3.0</td><td>I liked the book but the ending was a disepointment.

So I decided to read another novel in this series, Savannah Breeze.  This story was just as good, if not better.  Where Savannah Blues centered on Weezie Foley, Savannah Breeze focuses on her best friend, BeBe Loudermilk. Loudermilk owns one of the most successful and trendy restaurants in Savannah, as well as a number of rental properties.  At the annual Telfair Ball, Loudermilk meets the hunky, sexy, and refined Ryan Edward Millbanks, III.  They become an item almost immediately.  When her life becomes complicated by the hospitalization of her grandmother, Millbanks (an investment banker) starts taking over the care of her properties.  Before she knows what is happening, Millbanks has disappeared and she is told by the police that he is a con-artist.  Not only that, but he has swindled Loudermilk out of almost everything she owned including her house and all her possessions.  The only property she is left with (besides her restaurant which she can no longer afford to operate) is a dilapidated set of beach cottages on Tybee Island.  Millbanks used her money to buy The Breeze Inn, but didn't get a chance to liquidate the property before he had to leave Savannah. At first, Loudermilk is unsure of what to do with The Breeze Inn. She can sell the property for a small fortunate to a developer.  But finding herself homeless, she decides to renovate the cottages and make one of them her home with the help of caretaker Harry and with Weezie's vintage furniture.  She also hatches a plot to find Millbanks and to get her money back.  This escapade is a hoot and involves Weezie, Harry and Granddaddy Loudermilk. Andrews' books are always fun, but they also come with a message.  In Savannah Breeze, we learn that sometimes we find love in the most unlikely places.  Material possessions are way over-rated in bringing us happiness.  And sometimes what you think might be a personal catastrophe can actually turn out to be a good thing. I have already purchased another Andrews' book, Blue Christmas--she's that good.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A boring and un-original kids' fantasy book</td><td>2.0</td><td>Here is another children's book that I just could not get into at all. I read the first 75 pages, and even those were tough to get through. As a true Harry Potter fan, I found this book to be seriously missing the mark in the fantasy-magic genre. The characters were not well-written, and for me, when the characters aren't fully developed, I have a very hard time caring at all about any of them. The storyline just bored me to pieces, and a few elements seemed a little too familiar if you are an HP fan (i.e. a spiral staircase that winds its way up a tower, a character with the last name \"Trelawney\"). I think kids (probably ages 8 to 11) might enjoy this book if they already like the wizard/magic fantasy genre. But this book just did not do it for me.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Finally an excellent book on diversity within Islam</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am a philosopher and a specialist in Islamic studies with years of experience teaching Islam.  This book is absolutely fantastic!  With care and precision the author demonstrates the diversity of opinions among Muslims in ways that simplify but do not oversimplify the expressions of the adherents to that faith.  Far too many Christian conservatives want to argue that there is some \"essence\" of Islam, which if rightly understood endorses terrorism.  The author exposes this fatuous argument.  He clearly positions himself within Islam as a moderate or progressive, but is careful to show the historical origins of more conservative expressions of the faith.  I assigned this book in a grad course and it helped my students grasp the diversity within Islamic jurisprudence.  By the end of the course, when asked, \"What does Islam teach about....?\" they responded, \"Which expression of Islam?\"  If you tend to think of Islam as a unified monolithic, if not monotone, religion, read this book and learn to see it differently.  Another book written by a Christian evangelical who grasps the diversity within Islam is Matthew Stone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Reaching-the-Heart-and-Mind-of-Muslims/dp/B00F000ISE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Reaching the Heart and Mind of Muslims</a>.

With nothing else to loose, BeBe heads out to the Breeze and finds Hank, the cranky manager and a hotel that is in needs of lots of work - work she can't redily afford. This novel is a great fun to read and I found myself flying through the pages.

Not one to live off her family's money, she has cultivated a life for herself as one of the most successful businesswomen in Savannah.  She owns a restaurant called Guale, has rental properties across the city, and manages her grandparents' money in her spare time.  What she doesn't have time for, however, is to meet a good man after her three divorces.  When she meets Reddy Millbanks at a black-tie fundraiser, he sweeps her off her feet and does everything in his power to uncomplicate her hectic life.  Soon Reddy is taking care of BeBe's rental properties for her while she helps out her grandparents and they begin working together on some business ventures.  Then before she knows it, Reddy has left town and run off with not only BeBe's money, but her grandparents' too.  With not a cent left to her name, BeBe learns that the only thing she has left is an old motel on Tybee Island called the Breeze Inn that Reddy bought and had yet to unload.  With no place else to go, BeBe moves to the Breeze and revamps the place so that she can slowly rebuild her fortune.  The whole time, though, Reddy Millbanks is on her mind, and she vows that she'll get back everything that he took from her. Savannah Breeze is fun, entertaining Southern fiction.  Mary Kay Andrews has a great voice and does an excellent job of bringing forth all Southern imagery with her descriptions of life in Savannah and the beach.  Having just moved up north from Georgia, this book made me homesick with its stories of sweet tea, fresh fishing, and Southern hospitality.  That and a take-no-prisoners heroine, her equally quick-witted best friend, and Southern gentlemen who know how to treat a lady made this book a joy to read.  Savannah Breeze is the type of book you want to read on the beach when you're on a vacation from work and have time to sit around with a drink and enjoy it (there's a great drink recipe at the end of the book that would be perfect for your beach lounging).  But since it's the middle of the winter, I'd instead suggest reading it on a weekend afternoon, again with a cocktail, when you're in the mood for a good time with some outrageous characters and funny, romantic fiction.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Meat and Potatoes but where's the gravy?</td><td>3.0</td><td>\"The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists\", the name and it's subtitle imply to a potential reader that this book might touch an array of topics that Islam faces today. Although I truly believe Dr. El Fadl had the right concept in his writing, the book seems to fall just shy of  encircling the entire meaning of what problems and challenges the religion of Islam faces today. If you undertake writing a book with the premise of \"Wrestling Islam from the Extremists\", you most certainly should see some sort of grave villainy within different factions of the faith.  The term \"extremists\" seems to be left on the cover, never to be repeated throughout the book's pages. In it's place Dr. El Fald uses the term \"Puritan\" and uses \"Moderate\" representing what we assume are modern Muslims who adequately change with contemporary times.  The phrase \"Puritan\" is someone who is \"of strict moral code\". I personally feel that it does not even begin to describe sufficiently enough the past and present Islamic extremists. Certainly puritans of any religion represent a group who seek for it's members to stay true to that religion's ethnical and moral guidelines. If what we hear about from the \"moderate\" Muslims about what \"true\" Islam is wouldn't the \"Puritans\" be the side calling for returning to it's authentic meaning and practices?  If what Dr. El Fadl and many others say about true Islam's stance on terrorism, warfare, women's rights, violations  human rights, etc. are fact, then wouldn't the \"Puritans\" be the faction who forbid terrorism, warfare, violations in women's and human rights, etc? Instead, in his view, he believes the \"puritans\" are the side that turns a blind eye towards these things including terrorism and even advocates them. As well as the \"true\" meaning of Jihad. If it's purist form is, as he describes \"to strive, to apply oneself to struggle, to persevere....Therefore, cleansing oneself, from vanity, and pettiness, pursuing knowledge, curing the ill, feeding the poor, and standing up for the truth and justice are all forms of Jihad (pg. 221)\" then wouldn't the \"puritan\" side be calling for this interpretation as opposed to the Jihad embedded in terrorism we hear chanted in justification of ruthless actions?  It is a rather difficult job, if not impossible job to simply distinguish just who are Muslim \"puritans\" and who are Muslim \"moderates\". The issues that Dr. El Fadl discusses are issues that Muslim opinions vary greatly on. It is almost too complex to easily brand an all encompassing term such as \"puritan\" or \"moderate\" and begin to proclaim just who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\" .For instance; would a majority of Palestinian Muslims be considered \"puritan\" or \"moderate\"? If divisions exist between the two classifications on issues such as the use of terrorism, should we assume most Palestinian Muslims are \"puritans\"? Taking into consideration the numerous polls showing high numbers in favor of using terrorism against civilians, is the greater majority \"puritan\"? But in fact, many among them enjoy freedoms proscribed by the \"puritan\" sect of Islam, such as shaving of the beard, wearing of the hijab, dancing, the role of women, etc.. On page 230, Dr. El Fadl refers to the Prophet himself being upset and reproaching his army for killing a noncombatant. If puritans strive to keep their religion as true to the Prophet's actions as possible, why do they not condone the killing of noncombatants today? Certainly even some \"moderate\" Muslims fall short in this area as well , considering the Muslim world's acceptance of terrorist attacks such as 9/11 and bombings in London, Madrid, Beirut, etc. Page 235 reads; \"The Quran repeatedly emphasizes that God does not like aggression and does not love aggressors.\" Have Puritans not read and reread the Quran enough? Or even has the Prophet Mohammad failed practice what he preached in that area? Page 236 reads \"The Quran instructs Muslims to `cultivate forgiveness, enjoin goodness, and turn away from the ignorant'\" Perhaps this virtue needs to be reinforced today. He states that the Quran only justifies the use of violence as a way of defending oneself. Isn't that jello-mold of a explanation that can and is twisted and formed by some to justify using it today? Is Al Qaeda a group of \"puritans\" defending themselves? Are the Janjaweed \"puritans\" simply defending themselves?  Both of which, Dr El Fadl ceases to write about in his book. It almost appears to a reader that he wants to criticize certain Muslims, be is reluctant to do so he brands them an indistinctive all encompassing term of \"puritan\" and reminds readers that only \"moderate\" Muslims see a clear perception of Islam. I repeat that the label of \"puritan\" is not adequate enough in beginning to show just who the \"extremists\" are. They seem to have strayed from their religion and are not even in fact trying to keep it pure but are living in their own warped world of self righteousness and attempting to interpret a twisted view of \"the well of God\".  Possibly the answer does not even lie in the realm of spirituality itself. Maybe who Dr. El Fadl describes as \"puritans\" are most likely frenetic bedlamites misjudging how to carry out their own daily political and social life while practicing a very frail religious life. Harshness should be laid upon where needed when speaking about serious consequences of modern conflicts within Islam. Unfortunately the first maybe six chapters of \"The Great Theft\" can be hard to get though if you don't hold a PhD in Middle Eastern History or Theology complemented by an obsession for knowledge of religious foundations.  At times, parts can even be lengthy and redundant in some areas. Maybe if a reader can muscle through the sometimes incoherent Quranic verses and quotations of deceased Arab scholars and jurists with unpronounceable 10-12 syllable names , then you may just be fortunate enough make it to the latter half of the book. The most interesting and worthwhile chapters are without a doubt the last two chapters; Chapter 11 \"Jihad, Warfare, and Terrorism\" and Chapter 12 \" Nature & Role of Women\". Noting that both are of particular relevant to today`s world.  It is clear though that Dr. El Fadl is a brilliant scholar and thinker who can without a doubt see many problems lying within the Islamic world. He falls short of sometimes reciting specifically where they might lie and even is wary of giving criticism where criticism is due. Over all any inconsistencies in his theories and some long drawn out parts, the book is a decent read. Especially as events in the news come about daily involving Muslims reflecting Dr. El Fadl's writing. I would recommend it to anyone longing to dive deeper into an understanding of Islam and contentions involving the faith today.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Consistently Vonnegut</td><td>4.0</td><td>I used to be quite the fan of Kurt Vonnegut. I found his trenchant observations of human nature both biting and hilarious. To be exposed to this man's writings at a young age was a welcome epiphany that not everything was right with the universe. Consequently, I devoured most of his essays, novels, and short stories in the span of a few years. But like that person who leaves the last bite of a delicious meal til the last second, I saved a few unread gems for later in life. As for this novel, I wouldn't say Galapagos is anything less than one of Vonnegut's finest fictional offerings. Everything that defines the man's writing is there; hopelessly flawed characters trying to make sense of an otherwise insensible world; cosmic turns of fate that deny us any lasting happiness; and the inevitable decline of man due to his baser selfish nature, all of which is woven into a satirical tapestry that lays out the absurdity of the human race for all to see. But here's the thing; I'm not the same person I used to be in my twenties. True, I've known my share of human deceptiveness and manipulation. I've had my fill of empty friendships and jaded, selfish individuals... but the older I get, the less cynical I am. In fact, I'm more optimistic than I have ever been, and that, more than anything else, makes his writing more and more inaccessible to me. I suppose that after what Vonnegut experienced during WWII, his prevailing, cynical worldview would be inevitable. And for a time I couldn't get enough of it. I mean, his message is rendered in the most succinct, humorous prose imaginable, but I can't help but feel he got stuck somewhere. He could never turn that corner on the human race, nor escape from his experiences in Dresden. He never let go of the notion that people were less than worthy of this earth of ours. And where that philosophy once used to cast a sickly smile across my face, it's no longer there. Nor is my enjoyment of a writer I once considered to be one of America's finest.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Couldn't put it down</td><td>5.0</td><td>Mary Kay delivers again.

From an adult perspective, the plot has enough hints that you can kind of tell what's happening, but it still leaves you guessing, almost until the very end, and I like that - you get all these hints, and tastes of what's to come, which is nice.  The writing is imaginative, clear, and fast paced.  There were a few passages where it dragged a bit, but not much, and nothing that skipping a few paragraphs here and there couldn't take care of.

Not many times do you read a novel about mass murder and destruction, yet remains fairly light and casual...and is part sci-fi.

Every time I thought of reading it, the reviews said you'd either love it or hate it, and I figured with my luck in picking books, it would be another dud. When my colleague who like all the books I hate told me I absolutely had to read it, that was another incentive not to touch it. But boy am I glad I finally caved in and read it! I was hooked from the very beginning, and went to sleep way too late for my own good way too many nights because I couldn't put it down. It's really hard to explain why I liked the book. The story is exactly as improbable as it's described in the synopsys: Shadow is a guy who just got out of prison, whose beloved wife died, with no job prospects. A stranger who calls himself Mr Wednesday and who seems to know more about Shadow than he should offers him a job as driver and hired help. Shadow accepts and is given a glimpse of how gods and magical beings that live among us, forgotten and replaced by new gods: the media, technology, money. Shadow is a pretty dull, empty character, and there's no breakneck action. So what's so good about this book? If you like mythology, you'll probably like the book. And I am not talking about dime a dozen mythology, you know, greek gods in sandals, cartoon gods in costumes, etc. You may need to look up many of the gods up to figure out who they are and what they are about. I strongly recommend you do that by the way, and I suspect many who couldn't make sense of the book didn't bother to do that, and therefore didn't understand why the various gods did what they did, or said what they said. Make a little effort, with the help of technology it's not even that hard, and learn something about these characters and the cultures that created them. Even if you end up not liking the book, you'll have learned something and will therefore be a better person because of it. If Shadow is dull, the gods we meet along the way are vivid and interesting, and more than make up for Shadow's lackluster character. In fact pretty much everyone other than Shadow is very interesting and engaging. And the way the gods are woven into the normal everyday human society is (strangely) convincing, because they manage to stay in character even in the most mundane situations. I don't know if this review makes you want to read the book or not. As I said, there was nothing appealing to me about it until I read and, then I wished I had read it sooner.

Now, for me,  it's layout, flow, whatever you want to call it would, normally, have totally turned me off.

I found myself many times confused,  while at the same time intrigued, mystified, and titilated.

Sometimes more characterization.  Sometimes more focus. Sometimes more editing.  Sometimes just something more.  At times I found it wonderfully written and moving, at times I considered putting it down for good (mostly the middle section), and by the end I was definitely glad I had kept going.  But at all those times it never felt it quite matched up to its potential of setting or character.  I can see some starting it and never finishing it, but despite its flaws, I'd recommend slogging through whatever tough parts you come across.   There are a lot of strengths to the book.  The Venetian setting for one, is beautifully described.  But its role goes beyond simple window-dressing.  Lovric does an impressive job of making Venice essential to the story, making it almost a character itself in the way that it impresses itself on the people in the book, the way it causes certain actions and reactions.  It's a masterful job.   Some of  the characterization is also extremely well-done, most particularly the couple at the center of the novel who share part of its narration--the printer Von Speyer and his wife.  Watching their marriage through all its highs and lows is at times exhilarating and at others achingly painful.  They are the most realized characters and the most effective ones and the book seldom slips when they remain its focus.   Other characters, unfortunately, aren't as strongly composed.  Sosia, another major character, starts out strong, but then seems to twist in the wind a bit, stagnating as a character before becoming more and more unlikable.  She is one of those missed-potential examples.  There are places where her character could be redeemed (as a literary character, not in the moral sense) but those points are either glossed over too quickly and come too late, making them ineffective.  In the end, you wanted more from her as a character, wanted to feel more for her.  The same is true for several of the minor characters, such as Sosia's husband or Bruno and Felice, two of her (many) lovers.  Plot events manipulate you into feeling certain things about their relationships, or at least feeling you should feel something, but the emotions aren't really earned by the writing, mostly because the characters aren't drawn sharply or realistically enough.   The book has some pacing problems I thought.  The opening is somewhat slow, but I'm always willing to forgive that in a book of this sort and in fact it picked up not too far into the book.  Large parts of the middle third or so, however, gave me serious pause and almost convinced me on several occasions to just give up.  The final third, though it maintained some of the book's flaws, moved along more quickly and more movingly, culminating in a strong close.   Structurally, the book moves back and forth in time and narration. There are periodic jumps to letter written from Catullus to his brother detailing his life in Rome, the motivation for/creation of/reaction to his poems (the present-time publication of which is one of the major focuses in the book).  The letters are interesting in their own right and the parallels between his time and what is happening in Venice, both in terms of events and characters, quickly become clear.  At times, almost too clear and on at least one occasion near the end, I thought one of the past revelations weakened the book's ending rather than enhanced it.  Whether you  like the use of this structure is probably a matter of personal taste; I found it effective at first and less so as the book went on.  In either case, it's easily followed.   The narrative shift is equally clear but much more effective and in contrast to the time shifts, grows more so as the book goes on, adding intimacy and an emotional weight that a third-person narration wouldn't quite achieve.   Overall, the book was disappointing, more in relation to what you felt it could have been.  The strengths of the book were so strong that they tended to highlight its weaknesses, so you were left with a lot of \"what if\" feeling.  Still, if they did highlight the weaknesses, those same strengths also made the book, in the end, worth reading.  Recommended, but with some sorrow, and with understanding should some not finish it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>It sneaks up on you</td><td>4.0</td><td>This 15th century historical novel is a little slow going at first, but it sneaks up on you. Just sit back and allow the beauty of the writing, the images, and the atmosphere carry you along. The book is a series of related stories that weave together like a Venetian tapestry, full of shifting colors and blurry hints of depth and emotion. One is the story of Sosia, a lovely, sensual, but shallow Jewish girl married to a good man whom she detests. She takes many lovers, men of every rank in 15th century Venice society. Another parallel story is about a German who has come to Venice to set up a printing press. Many themes twist and turn through the pages of The Floating Book, themes that include Judaism, faith, fate, the importance of the written word, jealousy, poetry, seduction - and taken together, they create the old Venice of that era. Hence the title: that Venice was like a floating book of ideas. The author is clearly in love with words, and perhaps there are a few too many of them. But still, it's a lovely and evocative read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The Value of a Good Introduction</td><td>5.0</td><td>Unlike most novels, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" begins with an introduction that you have to read.  That is to say, most introductions are interesting and informative, but if you skip them you haven't really missed anything.  Not this one - if you want to read the novel, you are required to read the introduction.  That's just the way it is. I'm pleased to see that Kurt Vonnegut is now receiving the acknowledgment due him as a great American writer, and indeed received at least a part of that acknowledgment during his lifetime, but not as much as he will over the next few decades.  That's one reason you have to read the introduction.  Another is that Vonnegut's reputation rests primarily on a series of interconnected novels he published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is the last and probably best of these.  And finally, you have to read the introduction because it explains how and why he came to write the novel, and pretty much gives away the whole point of the piece. Under ordinary circumstances we would probably say that if we already know the point of a novel (or anything else), there's no reason to read it, but this is Kurt Vonnegut, remember.  In addition to everything else that was unique about him, he loved to talk to his readers, in person or in print.  You certainly read his novels because they're great, but you read them at least as much for the opportunity to hang out with the guy. Not to rehash the whole business, introduction or novel, but as the opening line declares, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is primarily about a man named Billy Pilgrim who has come unstuck in time.  He does not experience his life in a linear fashion, like you and I do.  Rather, he jumps around from event to event in his life randomly, and may find himself in any place or any period at any moment.  Which would be fascinating in and of itself, and made all the more so by the unbelievable things that Billy has been through, including the moments before his birth and after his death. You get to be with him as he works his way around Europe during World War II, eventually being captured by the Nazis and imprisoned, like his creator, in Dresden, just in time for the Allied bombing of the place.  You get to be with him during a perfectly normal upper-middle-class postwar lifestyle where he becomes an optometrist, marries the boss's daughter, prospers, and survives an airplane crash on his way to a convention.  You get to be with him when he's kidnapped by the alien Tralfamadorians for observation purposes, which is not as bad as it sounds when you consider that his captors are kind to him, teach him a great deal, and provide him with a companion in the form of a gorgeous adult-film star named Montana Wildhack. And you also get to be with him as he comes to realize from the Tralfamadorians that everything is eternal and immortal.  The aliens don't go through time in a linear fashion either, but unlike Billy, they are constantly present to every moment of time, from the creation of the universe to its destruction.  This is how Billy can be present on Tralfamadore with his gorgeous mistress and on Earth with his devoted wife both at the same time, and why he attempts to teach the world that nothing is ever lost.  He doesn't succeed, of course, but one of the best things about \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is that his failure doesn't bother him in the least, exactly because nothing is ever lost. Now, in some ways, this is kind of depressing, since it implies that the universe is going to go the way it goes no matter what we do, but Vonnegut's deliberately simple style somehow turns it into a comforting doctrine.  And that's the final reason you have to read the introduction. In it, as I said, he describes how he came to write \"Slaughterhouse-Five\".  Briefly, he wrote it in this particular manner at least in part because of the wife of his old Army buddy, a man who had lived through the bombing of Dresden with Vonnegut.  This woman worried that Vonnegut would make war sound like fun, and thus make children like hers want to go out and fight and die.  She needn't have worried - I can assure you there is nothing fun about war as presented here, although it is kind of amusing when Billy encounters a couple of characters from Vonnegut's previous books.  The important point, though, is that the author structured his book to not only claim, but demonstrate, that nothing is ever lost. One way he did this, and the most obvious, comes at the introduction's end, where he points out that \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" begins with the line \"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\" and ends with the line \"Poot-tee-weet?\"  That's his transcription of bird song, a sound Billy hears at a rather horrible moment.  The sound reminds him once again that no matter how dreadful life can get, the birds still sing, and their song, like everything else, is never lost. So in his introduction, Vonnegut brings the opening and closing of his novel together and shows us what it can teach us.  And now that you know that, you still have to read the introduction.  You have to read the novel, too, because there's more in it than just that.  I'll let you find it for yourself.  I'll tell you one thing, though; Vonnegut was a master prose stylist, and in \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" he found a style that matched his theme just about perfectly.  And that's rare enough that I can't allow you to miss it.  So what are you waiting for?  Go read it!

He is an intellectual and an alcoholic. My dad was an alcoholic but not an intellectual. I drink myself and have had a good many in depth discussions with many a drunken barroom philosopher. My old pal, the intellectual, and I have spent numerous evenings discussing \"life, love, the here-and-now and the forever after\" over a jug of wine or scotch and a big plate of ham and cheese. Oftentimes my old buddy would turn on the tape recorder and record our meanderings. In the days afterward, he would listen to them over and over - even without a bottle of scotch by his side. One day I asked him why in the name of heaven he was recording all our drunken babbling. He said, \"Some day I am going to put it all together and publish it as a Kurt Vonnegut novel.\" Reading Slaughter-house Five has been my first experience with Kurt Vonnegut and I must say my old buddy has a pretty good idea. Kurt admits to being a drinker in this book and calling friends on the phone late in the evening ... and babbling. I know nothing more about Kurt and his life than what I have read in this one short volume. But this book does remind me of many a bar-stool conversation that I have had in my lifetime. I sit down at my stool and the fellow next to me, Kurt Vonnegut, begins to expound. He smiles, laughs often and sucks me into his monologue. He begins light and airy but with a humorous gravity. A few minutes into his spontaneous dissertation, he lowers his head to the bar and goes to sleep. Ten minutes later, the bartender slaps his hand on the bar and Kurt wakes up. He immediately starts talking about his days as a prisoner of war in World War II. He talks for about five minutes and then his head collapses to the bar once again. When he awakes this time he has just been kidnapped by Martians. He talks about this experience for a moment or two but then slips off into the fog once again. Life goes on ... \"and so it goes\" until Kurt pops up again. This time he talks of his pal who didn't make it back from the war and somehow we slip into his wife and her current cancer treatments and then we go back to the slaughter-house where he and a few buddies were being held as prisoners during the bombing in Dresden, Germany in World War II. The next time he wakes up we are into his oldest son and the fist fight they had when the boy turned 22 and then we are off and into his third wife and her bouts with depression. Kurt wanders in and out of consciousness. He makes you laugh, he chocks you up and he changes the topic as soon as he thinks he could be losing you. His story has no beginning, middle or end. It is a feel-as-you-go type thing - spontaneous, quick-witted, personal, witty and emotional. And, like Mark Twain, he challenges the reader to find a plot. But yet you find yourself very entertained. And when you get up from your stool, you toss a few bucks onto the bar and tell the bartender to give Kurt a drink or two on you ... when he wakes up again. \"You know,\" you comment to the bartender before leaving, \"every barroom needs a guy like this. You got to keep this guy around.\" The bartender laughs. Kurt admits that he did not want to write about this subject and for much of the book he doesn't. It reads as if he wrote it with a bottle of scotch or bourbon by his typewriter. As the bottle empties the monologue becomes more intense, more emotional and more dramatic. The trick here is like with Mark Twain himself. Mark Twain was a \"rambler\" but he was also a serious writer. His rambling were planned and thought out and agonized over. I believe Kurt is of the same character. Contrary to intended appearances, he's not babbling and he is not drunk. He is writing, composing, creating. He is capturing his reader with variety and inventiveness. He has created a character of himself. He is definitely a \"different\" type writer. He has a style and a personality and it shows. He's good. Cheers Kurt. The stool next to me is always open. I will be reading more of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. I have a big stack of his books out in my poor man's library in a shed in my backyard.

I just finished it yesterday. I had attempted to read this book a couple of years ago, purchasing the original version. I think I made it as far as the prostitute swallowing a man with her vagina and didn't connect with it. For some reason, it wasn't time for me to read the book. Now, we have this wonderfully affordable paperback version of the author's preferred text, and me being the absolutist that I am, felt more inclined to make the attempt again more recently, knowing I was getting the full experience. Furthermore, this book had a way of coming back to me over and over again over the last couple of years; people I knew were reading it, they TV series is coming out soon, and other such references that made it clear that my intuition was urging me to come back to this story. The final message was seeing an ad for Neil Gaiman himself coming to San Diego for a talk recently, so, my resistance having been worn down, I went and bought the book. I am so glad that I did. This is easily one of the best fiction books I have ever read. It was thoroughly enjoyable from first page to last. This time I went in knowing everything would not make sense up front, and there would be strange and otherworldly happenings that I would have to go with until things became more clear throughout the book. As with many things, the timing was right and this was the perfect book for me at this time. The theme of old Gods living among us on the fringeremnants of the manifested idols and archetypes brought to America by immigrants through the years, now scraping a living as the downtrodden and grifters of the world once the cultures and beliefs assimilate or waneis an extremely interesting and fascinating idea. Add to that the notion that their meager way of life is now being threatened by the rise of new Gods, less traditional, more technical and topical, albeit less respectful and more ruthless, and you get a very fascinating, entertaining, humorous, mystical and quite simply beautifully written story full of all types of historical and mythological tidbits that reveal the author's extensive base of knowledge and interest. The character of Wednesday is one of the best characters in literature I've read, and I fell in love with him immediately. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book, most of the time because of something Wednesday said, although there were moments with other characters that were hilarious as well. I won't give away his true identity for new readers, but will say this version of the god would be a lot more fun to spend time with and from whom to hear stories than many other, perhaps more mythologically appropriate renditions. I was not put off by the \"horror\" aspects of this story, and while it went to some dark places and had elements of Stephen King-like gruesomeness, it was written with a certain kind of detachment that made it seem less visceral or effectual in an unsettling way, simply presented as another aspect of life in this crazy and strange world. The violence was not presented in a sensational way, in other words. Gaiman is more interested in taking the reader on a mystical, magical, mythological and spiritual journey, challenging beliefs and myths and exposing some hard truths about human life, than he is in shocking the reader through overly gruesome descriptions of the macabre. I really respect that. Although this book was written at the turn of the century, it is as topical, if not more so, now than ever and I believe we are witnessing a deconstruction of beliefs and a shifting of paradigms now more than ever, so this book is a wonderfully cathartic and entertaining way to process a lot of the raw emotion and confusion that we are experiencing right now. I certainly found it helpful in that regard. My only criticism is the fact that the book isn't longer. I think the story would have benefited from more time spent with the \"new gods,\" fleshing out their characteristics and motivations a bit more, although part of the point is that they are more mechanical, synthetic and hollow than the old gods, so giving them less room to develop and highlighting their precision and emotionless nature is perhaps the better choice. Gaiman certainly did a fine job presenting them as distorted and debased, characters who mock, defame, trivialize or insult some of the most hallowed and sacred subjects or experiences as a means of pure amusement. Still, there are certain characters I would have been happy to spend more time with, and the opposition could have used a bit more \"screen time\" as it were, to raise the stakes a bit. On the whole, however, the book is masterful and delightful and very relevant, and I can not recommend it highly enough.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Realistic read with little drama</td><td>5.0</td><td>Told in first person from the viewpoint of Rae Dodson, a nine year old girl who sleeps on her father's back.

After discovering that this book was set in Detroit, I rushed out and bought it the same day it was released. I was excited about the book because it seemed unique. The story of a daddy's girl also appealed to me because I was never that and secretly longed to be.  All of the characters in the book were memorable and interesting. I understood the mother with all of her faults, and I appreciated JD the father and his love for his child. If you're looking for a lot of drama, you won't find it in this book, but there is a hint of mystery involving JD, Rae, and JD's stepdaughter Kimmie that will keep you guessing until the very end. Also, the book was set in the 70's and the writer did an excellent job of placing the reader in that era. Similar to listening to an old song that triggers memories, this book did the same for me as I was a young child who grew up in Detroit in the 70's. If you're looking for beautiful prose and a book with a realistic feel that will thrust you into the story, this is the book I would recommend reading.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>So It Goes!</td><td>4.0</td><td>It seems to be the appropriate title for this review.

Billy Pilgrim barely escaped alive and was not of sound, mind, and body afterwards. He was haunted by his actions, his humiliation, and the inhumane conditions. He was also plagued by guilt. Billy's story could have made the book in itself. He married an overweight woman, Valencia who just wanted some man to love her and marry her. His life was plagued by tragedy as well.

Wonderfully written and beautifully realized, it is captivating from start to finish. It is the early 1960s, and Madeleine McCarthy's Canadian Air Force family is moving back to a base in Ontario after being posted in Germany. MacDonald lovingly paints a rich portrait of the rituals and traditions of families who move every three years--the neighbors, the welcome barbeques, the women who automatically greet new arrivals with enough food to see the new family through the unpacking stage, the kids who relish the anticipation of finding a  new best friend. MacDonald takes time setting this all up. It is so friendly, so happy, that something must be wrong, but what? Pay attention, because she is planting little mines all over the place, and they will explode. Madeline's loving French-Canadian mother, her adored dad, her kind older brother, are created with such love that they break your heart. The early sixties are a character in themselves, a time when WWII was a fresh memory and the cold war was a fact of life. Scientists were being smuggled out of the East to spill their secrets to the West. We talk about the Bay of Pigs in an abstract fashion today, forgetting how terrifying it was at the time and how it effected the psyches of  everyone who lived through it. \"The Way the Crow Flies\"  is certainly one of my favorite books so far this year. It hiccups once the life of the adult Madeleine takes stage, but does that take away from the affect of this novel? No. Ann-Marie McDonald is a sweet, tough writer. This book is hard to put down, and hard to forget.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Why is this book so popular?</td><td>1.0</td><td>I do not understand why this book seems to have the impact it did on the small business world.  While Gerber does present an intersting and inciteful idea that many businesses fail because there is lack of proper balance between the tecnician, the manager and the entrepreneur, he then goes away from this theme and recommends that all new companies should have a process that is detailed enough so your comapny can run without you.  He continues to emphasise and recommend this franchise type of business model.  He suggests that this will allow a new owner to hire those with no expertise in the product and to rely on the process itself to run the business. While franchises certainly offer a valid business model, to promote this way of business simply as a way to avoid the need to find and hire employees and managers with knowledge of your industry is simply ludicrous. He continues to return to a ficticious dialogue between him and a small business owner that i found simpy unrealistic and downright insulting. The impropper use of quotation marks as well as the capitalization of The Technician, The Manager and The Entrepreneur were quite annoying as well.  His editor(s) must have been those who were following an \"operations manual\" and had no experience in editing a book. I also question the length.  Most paragraphs in the book were one sentence long.  That, along with a painful repetative style led me to believe he was stretching it out as far as he could. All in all, he makes a few good observations in the first 50 or so pages; after that, a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Shocking and Powerful</td><td>5.0</td><td>I was unprepared for a book as blunt as NEMESIS proved to be.  Admittedly, under the law, it is impossible to slander a dead person, but a few of the players in Peter Evans' report still are alive, such as Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' sister and Senator Edward Kennedy. Nonetheless, they undoubtedly would be construed as public figures under the libel laws of the United States. Evans, therefore, obviously is comfortable with some of the allegations that he makes here.  Nobody who reads this book ever will feel the same about any of the primary cast of characters. President Kennedy reads almost like a sexual pervert and, according to Evans, his wife may have defined the concept of the \"Merry Widow.\" Her sister, Lee Radziwell, comes over as even more ungrounded than Jackie was in conventional morality regarding adultery--and this is being polite.  According to Evans, Marilyn Monroe sounds anything but simple, and Robert Kennedy appears almost venal. Evans casts doubt on everything including the motivation behind Jackie's pregnancies and those of Ethel Kennedy, considering them to be largely political tools contrived by the husbands. This seems hard to believe.  The person who comes across worst is Aristotle Onassis. Among the other assertions in this book, it is claimed that Onassis originally had been a homosexual and that the basis of his fortune had come from drug smuggling.  The kicker is that Evans states that Onassis had arranged for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, his \"nememis\" of the title, by Arabic terrorists.  NEMESIS makes for gripping reading, one of those books that prove impossible to put down until the very last page.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Essential Vonnegut, still relevant today...</td><td>5.0</td><td>I don't care who you are, you absolutely need to read this book. It's justly considered a classic. The thing about it is that it isn't really a \"humor book\" like some of Vonnegut's other, justly famous works (Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater). Parts of it are funny - I especially like the segments with the bitter Kilgore Trout, a sci-fi author reputed to be one of the worst ever - but humor isn't the focus of this book. Rather, it focuses on creativity and a solid message. Most if not all of Kurt's work is topical to some extent, but here his message comes to the fore. Vonnegut's view of time here is fascinating. Rather than present it as a straight line, as most other authors do, he explores its more abstract natures. To him, time is not a line, but a complex network of points that anybody at any time can travel arbitrarily amongst. This is prime creativity. Some of the most memorable segments of the book involve hapless hero Billy Pilgrim becoming \"unstuck in time.\" The first time he describes it, he takes a beautiful, \"poetic-prose\" approach. He floats freely through ideas, ideas that intentionally don't connect but are still beautifully written. Billy actually experiences both his birth and his death over the course of the book. But here is the REAL reason why you need to read Slaughterhouse-Five. It's very much an anti-war book, and the central message it communicates is that there are no heroes in war. The war Vonnegut focuses on is World War II, specifically the Allies' firebombing of Dredsen, Germany, an event that killed more people than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's clear that Vonnegut holds Nazi Germany in the utmost of contempt. But he also makes the claim that the Allies were not flawless, wonderful supermen. It's obvious that he believes in their ideals, but he also argues that they could be just as bad as their enemies. After all, countless German civilians were killed during the Dredsen firebomings, and I'm going to guess most of them had nothing to do with the Axis powers. In today's world, in today's wars, things aren't so black-and-white, and I think our President desperately needs a reminder of that. This conviction of his that America is the heroic cowboy, shooting down them no-good varmints with a gun in every holster, then mounting his horse and riding off into the sunset, is simply delusional. Don't get me wrong, I have as much if not more hatred for the terrorists our soon-to-be-ex-President (hopefully to be replaced by Barack Obama, but that's irrelevant) is so staunchly opposed to. They certainly are psychopaths, and the world would be a better place without them. But I can at least see where they're coming from. After all, hasn't America stolen their culture with its obsession with a globalist economy? There are no clear-cut heroes or villains in this war. Both sides have understandable motives, and while I admittedly side with the U.S. on this matter (though the Iraq War is at least as unnecessary as the Vietnam War, and has arguably done more damage to our country's reputation), the terrorists do have a point, I suppose. And that's why you need to read this book. Because war isn't as simple and clear-cut as certain presidents would like to believe it is. This is a fine example of preaching to the choir, since I'm a pacifist (except in extreme cases, like World War II), but I simply love this book on many, many levels. Vonnegut's masterpiece. If you wanted proof that he was an author of real literary merit and not just some weirdo - though if that's the case, you can't be my friend - this is a sure bet.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>An anti-glacier book...</td><td>5.0</td><td>Following \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" Kurt Vonnegut swore off novels. In the introduction to his 1970 play, \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June,\" Vonnegut quotes himself: \"I'm left-handed now, and I'm through with Novels. I'm writing a play. It's plays from now on.\" Thankfully he didn't keep this promise. \"Breakfast of Champions\" appeared a mere three years later. An eye blink in time. Maybe Vonnegut thought he couldn't outdo his 1969 masterpiece? His Everest was conquered, so to say. Understandable, because \"Slaughterhouse Five\" remains his most quoted, chatted about, and revered book. And though it fits square-peg square-hole right into his body of work, he never wrote anything else quite like it. Next year it  turns 40. It has had a difficult life. Some potty-mouthed irreverent language made it anathema to didactic schoolmarms and the straight-laced. But controversy usually bites back, and the book entered the national spotlight. Censorship has always fueled sales. Even back then. Business 101. \"Slaughterhouse Five\" tells the story of a secular messiah optometrist, Billy Pilgrim. Like Vonnegut, who appears as the \"I\" and \"me\" throughout  the book, Pilgrim was in a bomb shelter when Allied forces firebombed the cultural haven of Dresden to absolute smithereens. Historical descriptions are ghastly. Though the German government later revised the initial estimates of 135,000 dead to around 35,000, it remains a brutal massacre nonetheless. Pilgrim comes to Dresden via the Battle of the Bulge where he and his companions are captured and shipped in miserable rail cars to a prison camp. There, proud and hearty British officers feed and entertain them until the Nazis transfer Pilgrim's unit to Dresden as laborers. Once there, they sleep in \"Schlachthof-fnf,\" or \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" where meat was once processed. Soon after, the city gets drenched in flames as the prisoners sit helplessly in subterranean bomb shelters. Horror awaits them when they emerge. Dresden now looks like the surface of the moon. Though Dresden's destruction undoubtedly provided the inspiration for Vonnegut's magnum opus, the story focuses more on the life of Pilgrim and his revelations on temporality. But being a \"witness\" to Dresden carries far-reaching implications. And there is nothing linear about this narrative or its implications. It begins, famously, with the line \"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\" Like Christ, on who he's loosely modeled (hints abound throughout the text, though this is by no means a religious book), Pilgrim has \"good news\" for humanity. Good news about time and the impact of death. We've been wrong all along, it turns out. After surviving Dresden, becoming a rich and successful optometrist, Pilgrim gets abducted by aliens in 1967. They take him 446,120,000,000,000,000 miles from earth. There he becomes the center of attention, the supposed \"perfect specimen\" of humanity. Even his urinating causes cheering. In short, he's in an alien zoo. These aliens, known as Tralfamadorians, give Pilgrim a new view of time. Time isn't linear, they tell him. It's total. Every moment has always existed and always will exist. So we live forever. On top of that, in the zoo Pilgrim gets to mate with a human hottie: Montana Wildhack (as opposed to Valencia, the unattractive woman he marries for money and stability). All of his dreams come true. He no longer fears death (presented as violet light and a hum). He's free, and he wants to tell the world. Of course humanity, including his own daughter, consider him nuts. Pilgrim has internalized this philosophy of time, and he jumps from one episode of his life to another, seemingly at random. Only Kilgore Trout seems to understand. Pilgrim's view of time provides the novel's main tension and theme: the old hoary question of free will and determinism. The Tralfamadorians are deep determinisists. In fact, Earth represents the only planet they know of where talk of \"free will\" occurs. They provide the mouthpiece for one of Vonnegut's most poignant lines: \"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\" Such passages have led to debates concerning the novel's view of free will. Was Vonnegut denying free will? Does he think we have any control over our destiny? The novel doesn't take sides. Instead, it presents a middle path in the form of a brilliant Vonnegut cartoon. A locket hangs between two potato shaped breasts - Montana Wildhack's breasts. It reads: \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.\" So are we free or determined? Both. The most important thing humans can do is know the limits of our powers. Some things we can change, other things we cannot. With this masterstroke, Vonnegut also helps redeem the often disparaged medium of cartoons. Finally, no discussion of \"Slaughterhouse Five\" can ignore the book's most ubiquitous phrase: \"So it goes.\" Vonnegut inserts this laconic quip whenever a death occurs. Some have interpreted this move as making light of or as dismissing the impact of mortality. But this repetitive leitmotif can also produce the opposite effect: it can magnify death's impact by simple repetition. After finishing the book, \"So it goes\" will likely linger in the head for days. Though \"so it goes\" represents and calls attention to death, it nonetheless reads as humor, but as \"naughty humor\" evoking hesitant or guilty laughter. Many critics have described Vonnegut's work as a perfect combination of funny and sad. This aptly describes the effect of \"So it goes.\" Likely \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" a deceptively easy read, will stand as Vonnegut's major work as long as people continue to read twentieth century literature. Sadly, Vonnegut passed away in 2007. One is tempted to say \"so it goes,\" but unaccompanied by laughter. All one can say is thanks for this book, Kurt, and everything else.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Simple and Simplistic</td><td>2.0</td><td>This is an easy-to-read satire that alludes to the weighty concepts of war, death and fate but never seems to bring home the point.

That book topped 500 pages, and this one, THE WAY THE CROW FLIES, went over 800 pages! Even so, I managed to get through it in just over two weeks, even with some minor heart surgery thrown in somewhere in the middle of it. This book has probably already had reams of reactions written, so there's probably not much original that I could add. It is, quite simply, 'unputdownable' (is that a word?). This book has something for everyone. I was originally intrigued by reading that the core sequence of events took place around the time of the Cuban Missile crisis in October of 1962. During that pivotal moment in Cold War history I was not quite halfway through army basic training in Ft Leonard Wood, Missouri. As trainees, we had very limited access to media reports of what was happening, but we could, I remember, feel a palpable tension emanating from our drill instructors and cadre, an unsettling sense of urgency about what they were doing - training us! MacDonald's protagonists in TWTCF are a young family in the Royal Canadian Air Force (the RCAF no longer exists), the McCarthys. The father, Jack, is a WWII veteran and a senior officer at a training base in Centralia, Ontario. They have just been transferred there from Germany. Jack and Mimi (an Acadian beauty) have two children, Mike (Michel) and Madeline, who are twelve and eight when the story opens. Although MacDonald offers multiple points of view in the course of this mammoth epic, Madeline is the main focus of the story, with Jack running a close second. Jack's big disappointment in life was a flight training accident he suffered during the war, when he was just 18, which impaired his vision, making him unsuitable for flying status. Ever after he \"flew a desk\" as a support officer. That partial 'blindness' plays an important symbolic part of the narrative, as he is chronically unable to see what is happening to his children, or to properly see \"the small picture\" in his constant striving to understand the \"big picture\" of Cold War conflicts and intrigues in which he is naively embroiled, things which nearly destroy him in the end. MacDonald is a writer of prodigious talent, mixing dark fairy tale symbolism with comical samples of pop culture and humor, and that comic relief is very necessary in this disturbing and increasingly dark story of pedophiles, political intrigue and entrapment. The author has obviously done her homework. I learned more about that aforementioned Cuban Missile crisis and also about the U.S. missile program and space race between the U.S. and the USSR from this book than I could ever have imagined. There is much here too about the sinister involvement of former Nazis and war criminals in that missile and space development program - on both sides of the Iron Curtain. (A selected bibliography is appended at the end of the novel.) The darkest part of the plot, however, is found in the lives of the little girls of the story, Madeline and her classmates (and they come alive in ways that fiction has seldom succeeded in the past), and the vile ways in which they are victimized by an unscrupulous pedophile, practically under the noses of the children's unsuspecting and preoccupied parents. This sexual abuse has far-ranging ripples and repercussions which will haunt these kids - and their parents - for the rest of their lives, as is represented in the continuing story of Madeline McCarthy and her family over the next couple of decades. I wonder how many people are frightened away from a book like TWTCF by its very 'heft.' I pity those readers who are. Because what MacDonald has wrought here is a simply stunningly beautiful book - primarily about human relationships and families. And she has placed it into an historical and cultural context that makes it all the more believable and effective. I can't understand how she managed to keep all those balls in the air, and how she made it all seem so effortless, so real, and so darkly beautiful.

Don't let the apparent brevity fool you; this book could have just as easily been a decidedly heavy handed article in a scholarly journal on sociology or political science. There are many sections that are intellectually challenging. Yet at the same time, Steele makes the subject matter accessible to all. And frankly, there will likely be many people (typically the white liberals and blacks criticized within) who will be aghast at his thesis. Just as disconcerting though are the white conservatives who will grab onto this book as a \"see, I told you so\" moment. Neither side of this debate should jump to any conclusions regarding the content. It simply is a starting point; certainly not a definitive analysis. Steele does attempt to soften the tone by overlaying the material onto his metaphorical journey along California Highway 101. As Mark Twain did with Huck Finn, Steele's journey is a symbolic epiphany as he recognizes that America of his 1950s childhood is as foreign to the 21st century as 1776 is to modern Constitutional scholarship. He intersperses anecdotes from his childhood with his  \"coming of age\" in the 1960s. During these passages, we get a glimpse as to how Steele, in a rejection of \"groupthink\" and \"victimhood\" , ascends to a different point of view.

This is the kind of novel that I found myself telling people about  as I was reading it.  From the ethics of using Nazi scientists to build the space program, to the rush to judgement in crime investigations, to the relationships of husbands and wives; discussions could range far and wide in the context of this book.  I was unsettled the whole time I was reading it and this is not a book I will soon forget.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Interesting - realistic - fun read - long!</td><td>5.0</td><td>This book brought back many memories of growing up in the 1950's.

He thinks that the upheavals of the 60's were made possible by white guilt, which weakened the authority of the older people who had accepted overt racism. He especially criticizes race-based preferences in higher education.  He thinks the real purpose of affirmative action is so that the institution can dissociate themselves from the racist past by having a racially diverse student body - that they aren't interested in the actual effect of their policies on the black people they're supposedly trying to help.  He thinks affirmative action is an insult to black people, implying they can't make it on their own.  He points to black excellence in music and sports, to show that racism doesn't have to limit black people. Race-based discrimination in affirmative action is indeed ugly and often unfair.  Rich black students probably don't need it, and there are many students who have had severe disadvantages who aren't helped by affirmative action.  It's also currently unpopular, even among black people.  A 2016 Gallup poll found that only about 43% of black people thought race/ethnicity should be a factor in college admissions.  So perhaps race-based preferences are perceived as insulting and damaging by many black people, not just Shelby Steele. Some institutions only practice affirmative action in the sense of doing special outreach to under-represented groups, without lowering admissions standards for them.  This doesn't seem offensive, and it's much more popular. Better than race-based preferences would be to remove barriers to black people doing their best.  Steele doesn't believe that black people are still oppressed, but that's an extreme minority view.  And he doesn't give suggestions to improve the situation of blacks, except to end the \"soft bigotry of low expectations\". But in a 2017 poll, 92% of black people think there's still discrimination against blacks in the USA.  And research shows they're right.  Many people are still prejudiced against blacks and discriminate against them. Many liberal and libertarian ideas would help disadvantaged people, including black people, without explicitly discriminating in favor of blacks. Access to abortion and birth control helps women stay out of poverty.  Shelby Steele is in favor of abortion rights - good for him! Restricting gun ownership similar to how Germany does it, would help impoverished areas by making them safer and less stressful to live in, and also more enticing places to locate a business, since it would be less likely to get robbed.  Many Germans own guns, yet Germany has only 2% of the gun homicide rate that we do in the USA.  In Germany, people are carefully screened and  have to pass a knowledge test in order to obtain a gun license;  they have to actually need a gun for some purpose other than self-defense, such as hunting, collecting guns, competitive marksmanship, or for their job;  semiautomatic weapons are strictly limited; and the authorities can check gun owners' property to make sure the guns are being safely stored. Legalizing consensual crimes such as drug use and prostitution would also reduce gun violence in impoverished areas.  And it would end the \"criminal track\" that sends so many disadvantaged young black men to prison, to serve long sentences. Making good healthcare available to everyone regardless of their income also helps the disadvantaged.  Conservatives like Steele want people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but that's often not possible if you're chronically ill.  Or uninsurable, and you get swamped with medical bills. Steele touts \"compassionate conservatism\" as helpful, but it doesn't seem to have come to much.  Trump promised to help disadvantaged people, but in reality his attempted changes have favored the rich. Steele also describes the intense \"political correctness\" that he experienced in a college English department.  He describes white academic leftists using white guilt to manipulate others.  It's easy to imagine intense jockeying for power among academics, rationalized as caring for minorities.  In that environment, the distortions of political correctness were exaggerated.  He says that standards for excellence in writing were abandoned in favor of ethnic literature courses that included mediocre writing, in order to make the whites who suggested them look good and make up for their own mediocrity. But he wouldn't have experienced any of that in the physics or biology departments.  Nobody advocates \"ethnic physics\" courses. That \"politically correct\" mentality was prevalent in the larger society as well, in a less concentrated form.  And it has led to problems that Shelby Steele doesn't discuss. White shame, for example, is very toxic to interactions between black and white people.  When white people are afraid of being accused of racism, they are constrained and tense around black people, don't see them as people, treat them with stiff politeness.  And because of their anxiety and tension, they avoid social interaction with blacks and avoid hiring them.  Which causes a vicious circle and generates racism:  tension around blacks causes whites to discriminate against them, which makes black people resentful, which causes whites to perceive black people as angry and scary, which makes them more tense ...  Most of the actual shaming is done by white people to other white people. Steele does discuss \"white blindness\" - the tendency that whites have to not see the black person there, only their own concerns.  But not white shame and the way it actually generates racism. \"White Guilt\" is perhaps dated in the time of Trump.  A lot of whites don't seem to feel shame about their racism, nowadays.  Perhaps the lessening of white guilt will ultimately be good for both black and white people. Shelby Steele is often accused of being in denial about the racism that still exists.  But he doesn't seem like that in \"White Guilt\".  He describes blatant racial discrimination that he experienced.  His attitude seems to be more \"Yes, there's racism, but so what?  Work hard at what you love and you'll become excellent and have your own life.  I did it, you can too!\".  Maybe he's wrong about that - he's a gifted person, not an average black man.  But it's refreshing after all the talk about black victimization. He believes that black people will have to uplift themselves; he says no oppressed group has ever been uplifted from the outside.  That's likely true.  But a lot can be done to get out of black people's way, by enacting the kind of liberal/libertarian reforms described above.  And Shelby Steele as a conservative may be opposed to much of that.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Great Horse Story</td><td>5.0</td><td>Beautiful Jim Key is a heart-warming story of a very smart, unusual horse which is impossible not to love.

As a New York City baby boomer who came of age at the time I have been following the differing interpretations of what this may have meant for many of us. Steele's informal (yet informative) sytle is very refreshing. I have also been at a loss to understand or explain what I would call \"tyrannies of the left\", namely, much of the misguided cant and shoddy scholarship that seems to be the standard fare in many college English departments. My particular gripe is how so many well intended people basically destroyed the CUNY system.   Once the hope of many who, like myself, couldn't afford higher education in the private \"free market\" but who knew that, with good grades and hard work, there was a place that offerred world class teaching and opportinities absent the requirement of tuition. It was once the crown jewel of \"The Big Apple.\" No more. Open admissions and escalating fees have basically gutted what it once meant to have have access to a genuine higher education via meritocracy.  Faculty were first rate and the students were among the brightest in the city.   Alas, the English department also has a right wing. My first exposure to this creature. Since I share Professor Shelby's concerns over what might be called \"curricular rot\", i.e., non-academic offerings posing as the genuine article, the politicization of damn near everything and, in general, the obscenely priced extension of high school that now passes for \"college\", I read his book with much interest. Sadly, it was a letdown of the highest order. His explanatory variable is \"White Gulit\": a new adventure in metaphysics.   The appeal of this concept is that it is a seductive illusion. Tantalizing, but impossible to operationalize and serving as a magic catch-all for whatever seems to trouble you. Like \"black invisibility\", its more irritating cousin, it clearly generates discomfort but is impossible to nail down because \"black\" and \"white\" are simply code words for very complex social realities. The drama they conceal is universal: What is the proper relation between freedom, the individual, and the state? Who benefits from this dialogue? The social sciences deal directly with these issues but neither a proper understanding a full formulation are available as slogans or suitable for bumper stickers.   It is not clear to me what Professor Shelby (as a \"black conservative\"--a term he clearly dislikes, yet champions) wishes to conserve. Before World War II , and absent the dissent of the sixties, the American higher education system did what all such system do: preserve class privilege for those who are favored. We have come full circle: college can now cost the price of a house.   Serious stuff. Solutions, however, will not be forthcoming from the English depaertment. Its left wing is currently enamored of French philosophers, and its right seems to be fixated on racial stereotypes. I'll leave it to the psychologists to figure out if Shelby' concerns fall within their purview. It used to be that when one studied college English one learned something of that subject matter and how to clearly express one's ideas. Oh, I forgot, that was in the \"decadent\" sixties when we all were less enlightened and were so foolish as to take our teachers seriously. I was never able to discern any political agenda in their course assignments where, I recall, the professors worked as hard grading them as we tried to muster the energy necessary to meet their expectations. Was that a dream? Was it a magic carpet suspended only by nostalgia? One never knows, after all, when looking back at the sixties.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>I Wish I Would Have Read This Years Ago</td><td>5.0</td><td>Wow.  \"E-Myth:  Revisited\" should be on the list of required reading for anyone who wants to start a small business or feels trapped by their current small business.

I have re-experienced the book several times since first picking it up in high school, and its powerful ideas are more compelling and moving every time. Vonnegut's message about the horror and futility of war is so stirring because of the gentle sincerity and quiet simplicity with which he conveys it. Sadly, it seems the world has been in a constant state of violence and conflict in one region or another since Vonnegut wrote his book so many decades ago.

In Neil Gaiman's own words this is a release from prison, a road trip, and a corrupt town all balled into one big book. My biggest problem with this book is its sheer length. While parts of it are really good and engaging, drawing you right in, there are other parts that have so many useless facts that I felt really hard pressed to keep listening. Shadow is a very personable protagonist and even with his flaws you find yourself becoming increasingly fond of him and what he continues to go through. It helps that all the other characters are so vile that they make him shine in comparison. I can't get into the antagonist without really giving anything away. It really kept me guessing throughout the story. I think that's another one of this book's greatest points, it leaves you wondering just enough so that you keep reading even when you don't really want to. I gave this book a 4 out of 5. It is seriously bizarre and has some strong sexual content that may not be for everyone. I'm a fan of bizarre and at times it was even too out there for me.

I don't usually write long posts. I hate it when others do it consistently and I rarely read them. The reason I love Ms. Beverly historical romance novels, and what sets her apart, is that she is a student of African American history. She never fails to educate the reader.  She isn't a fluff writer. Yes there is erotica, but it is only a small part of the story. She drops some knowledge on you at the same time. We are reintroduced to Archer, Sable, Raimond, Cullen, the children, and the other LaVaq brothers. Archer LaVaq is the main male character in this continuing saga.  The primary female character is a Union operative (spy).  Her current assignment places her in New Orleans to play a high price Madame.  She opens a house of ill repute that caters to the monied men in New Orleans.  They figured that sex and alcohol make for loose tongues. I suggest for those who aren't in the know to please read Indigo and Through the Storm to familiarize yourselves with the cast of characters before venturing to this book, though each book stands alone. The time period that the characters are in is set towards the end of Reconstruction that ended in 1877.  Lieutenant Governor, Oscar Dunn, was a formidable Radical politician and he had many enemies. Archer and the other LaVaq brothers discussed Oscar Dunn and his sudden death.  It was an open secret that he was poisoned.  Here is an excerpt from a book I read \"Capital Men\" by Philip Dray.  If you read my review of this book by Mr. Dray, you will notice I am not a fan of this book or any of the author's works.  However, he did a good job with telling the story of Oscar Dunn.  So I can't deny him his due completely.  I took only a small section to share with y'all. Excerpt: In the midst of the crisis, in November 1871, Oscar Dunn came down with a nagging, Debilitating cough, a condition he and his friends assumed had resulted from his strenuous duties.  For about a month he had been suffering from what his doctor called \"pulmonary catarrh,\" a popular cure-all \"recommended for weak hearts.\"  The product, however, had been ineffectual in curing his weariness and hoarseness.  On Saturday, November 20, Dune gave a talk at the Third Ward Radical Club and was in good form.  Sunday morning he ate a hearty breakfast and spent the day with his cohort Marshal Packard.  After dinner, however, Dunn had a severe attack of vomiting, and on Monday, E.D. Beach, the family doctor, was called in.  Beach diagnosed pneumonia, noting that the lieutenant governor's brain was \"evidently much affected,\"  and put him to bed, in the care of a nurse.  During the night Dunn slipped into unconsciousness, and Packard was summoned.  Seeing his friend's desperate situation, he called in another physician, Dr. Scott, who declared that Dunn was suffering from congestion of the brain and lungs brought about by excessive vomiting. Other leading physicians of New Orleans arrived, including Dr. Warren Stone, a local medical pioneer, but they ventured no new diagnosis and expressed puzzlement at Dunn's rapid deterioration.  Consulting in hushed tones, they cast pitying looks at the patient's wife, who, along with other family members, had convened a deathwatch by the bed, where Dunn lay emitting \"a regular gurgling sob that occasionally changed to a harsh rattle.\"  Mrs. Dunn, alternately clutching a handkerchief and lowering her face into her hands, came and went, unable to remain for long in the presence of a scene so unbearable.  Dunn's nurse, observed that she had \"never seen pneumonia like that.\"  Gently wiping the drops of blood and mucus from Dunn's lips, she assured her patient that \"Jesus is coming - Jesus will soon be here to take you away.\"  At the sound of her voice, Dunn opened his eyes and appeared to scrutinize the woman's face, \"his blank stare mirroring the baffied confusion his soul.\"  \"They've given poison to the Governor,\" another servant said quietly.  \"They've poisoned the Governor.\"  Late Tuesday night, November 23, he slipped from consciousness for the last time, and soon one of the physicians signaled that the struggle had ended. When the local coroner, Dr. Creagh, he encountered a police physician, Dr. Avila, who was preparing to depart; Avila said that Dunn's family had turned him away.  At Creagh's urging, Avila returned with him to the house, where Creagh explained to Dunn's survivors that a rumor of the lieutenant governor's poisoning was already abroad on the streets, and it was Creagh's duty under law to conduct a postmortem to ascertain the true cause of death.  The family, supported by Beach and the other attending physicians, refused Creagh as had Avila, insisting that Dunn had died of natural causes.  They also rebuffed Cragh's request to examine a sample of Dunn's body waste, which might have helped confirm or dispel the suspicion of poising. Was Oscar Dunn poisoned?  His overall condition and specific symptoms- vomiting, muscle spasms, shrunken features and whitened face, weak pulse, coma - correspond with classic accounts of arsenic poisoning.  Because the symptoms arsenic causes resemble those of natural illness, and because, colorless and flavorless, it can be mixed undetectably with food, this poison was known as a handy means of retribution or a shortcut to an inheritance.  Certain arsenic compounds were used in the nineteenth century to treat syphilis, which might explain Dunn's family's demand for secrecy, although there is no evidence he suffered from the disease. O course, the theory that had \"set tongues upon swivels\" on the streets of New Orleans was that Dunn had been murdered for political reasons. Whether Dunn was poisoned, or his natural, if untimely, removal simply agitated local suspicion, what mattered was that a man who may have had a stabilizing effect on Reconstruction in Louisiana had been cut down in his prime.

I see it, Sarah, and you can, too.\" BARF! seriously. what is this junk? was she his lover or just a bad idea from his editor? just stick to the business ideas. 2) mumbo jumbo -- he writes quite a bit about a \"game\" management must create for its workers, but i really have no idea what hes talking about. either explain it or scrap it. he also refers to sales scripts and other concepts as if they are patented E-Myth inventions w/ fancy names...mumbo jumbo. 3) get rich scam -- the author borders on snake-oil salesman. much as he advises in the book, this book itself is an emotional \"hook\" that is designed to get you to contact E-Myth Enterprises and schedule some financial/business planning training sessions. book is littered with ads to visit his website. same schtick that the \"4 Hour Work Week\" guy does, not surprisingly since that book is a new version of this content inspired by emyth. ...so, if you can ignore the advertising ploys and the sappy, terrible writing style, and stick to the biz concepts, its good.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The \"Shot gun Wedding\" Heard Around the world: Jackie O and Ari Onassis</td><td>5.0</td><td>Except for the garish cover jacket, this is a devilishly well-written and well-presented book. True enough it is \"conspiracy fare,\" but with a flair: a la British style, where the conspiratorial plot is insinuated rather than unceremoniously stuffed down the reader's throat as uncontestable media-driven and \"state sanctioned\" fact. The strength of the book however is not the conspiratorial plot, which in my view is mostly a sideshow to the main event. Its power lies in the excellent writing that exposes the utter shallowness of the pseudo-royal and nuevo-monied jet-setters, as they go about their desperately empty lives, trying to pump meaning into them by way of extra-marital sex, alcohol and drugs, gaudiness, world-class treachery, lavish globe-trotting cruises and parties, and mindless spending for spending sake, in short, the worse sort of debauchery. There was a time when such decadent hubris, and money-based royalty was to be envied as the \"good life,\" but Peter Evan brings them and their phoniness back down to earth and it is not a pretty picture. When he finishes with them, using mostly their own words (as he very carefully mines most of his material from a host of their own memoirs), there is certainly very little left to envy about them. At the epicenter of the story are the two \"uber-egos\" of RFK and Ari Onassis, locked into battle for over a generation, and who, despite all their power and wealth retained the social minds of a couple of juvenile delinquents. Their respective struggles and feuds bordered on the psychopathic, more befitting a couple of teenage gang leaders than respected world-class \"prime movers.\" But this seemed not to have bothered either of them one iota, as they both continued obsessively committed to the utter destruction of the other. According to the author, the seminal event triggering the feud was Onassis' paranoid suspicions that it was RFK's hidden hand responsible for scuttling his carefully laid plans to corner the oil tanker shipping market, first in Saudi Arabia, then in Haiti. Likewise, Bobby was equally worried and paranoid that Onassis, would use his tight-knit social connections (within the Kennedy clan via Jackie's sister and eventually via Jackie herself) to find out and use what dirt he could uncover, against the Kennedys, thereby scuttling first JFK's chances of being re-elected, and then RFK's chances of becoming President after his brother's assassination. These mutual suspicions eventually spilled over into \"all out\" psychological warfare and reached a crescendo in the run up to Onassis determined efforts to marry Jackie, which he eventually did. But not before RFK first forbid it, then to avoid a scandal (since the whole world already knew Onassis was screwing Jackie), insisted on it. If you believe the author's version of the way events unfolded, RFK got the worse of this multi-decade series of vendettas that coalesced around JFK's widow's \"shotgun marriage\" to Onassis. What is insinuated (if only ever so lightly) is that Onassis, after marrying Jackie, used his Palestinian connections to pay for (though not set up)  the hit that ended in RFK's assassination. A la British style, one is of course expected to read between the lines and connect the dots for himself, which is fine if you are a non-American: this version then makes perfectly good sense. But if you live within U.S. borders, you can almost feel the other anti-RFK wheels grinding as they pre-position themselves (with Ari's 1.5-3.5 million dollars) to take advantage of the RFK-Onassis feud: And here we mean, LBJ/Hoover/Mob/Texas oil/CIA machinery, for instance. Just as Evan-Prichard's \"The Secret World of Bill Clinton,\" exposed the corruption surrounding Bill and Hilary Clinton, this book, written by another Englishman, attempts to tie up the loose ends surrounding the primal feud between Onassis and Bobby Kennedy. One does not need to be a conspiracy nut to enjoy a well-documented, well-told story, and this is it. Five stars</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A beautifully eloquent, concise statement of how a great moral battle was won and lost</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a highly personal reflection on the part of Shelby Steele, literally conceived in a single drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco. White guilt, says Steele, had \"generated a new social morality that made racial prejudice utterly illegitimate.\" More important, according to Steele, white guilt makes \"the moral authority of whites and the legitimacy of American instituions contingent on proving a negative: that they are not racist.\"   While this was a unique achievement, it also opened the doors wide to hucksters who would exploit white guilt while doing nothing for the people who were supposed to be liberated.   In perhaps the most powerful chapter of the book, Steele uses a column about the dissenting opinion of Justice Clarence Thomas to make his point: white liberals, Steele says, feel that people like Thomas should show \"gratitude\" for affirmative action. As Steele puts it Dowd \"is trying to \"annihilate\" [Thomas] to put him in his place as an inferior who can advance only through the largesse of superiors like [Dowd].\" These words and the balance of this particular chapter are a scathing indictment of white liberals and white guilt.   Steele's \"White Guilt\" is a stunning document. He truly does establish how, as the subtitle puts it, blacks and whites together destroyed the promise of the civil rights era. Every thinking person concerned for the destiny of American society should read this book. Jerry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Deadly Accurrate!!!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Shelby Steele is deadly accurate with his assessment of the post Civil Rights environment.  This is the first book that I've read where the author provides cogent, concise, logical thought regarding this lingering social issue.  The highlight of the book is the way Steele brilliantly demonstrates how America was forced to reconcile the embedded acceptance of white supremacy with the articulated theme of a nation built on freedom and equality for all citizens throughout its history.  This conundrum, according to Steele, robbed America of its moral authority.  However, the manner in which white America dealt with this problem created a situation that is arguably far worse. The Civil Rights movement forced America to \"look into the mirror\" and clearly see the ugly image created by the ambiguity and hypocrisy of what it said versus how it treated its Black citizens.  Steele then illustrates how the guilt caused by this dilemma set off a chain of actions that effectively took America down a slippery slope that destroyed any chance of regaining moral authority.  Specifically, we find ourselves in an environment in which no white person is able to even insinuate that much of Black America's problems are of its own making.  To make such a statement will result in that person being labeled a racist.  Ironically, this lack of moral authority to point out inherent social weakness robs Black citizens of learning to adopt a positive attribute of white America.... i.e. the development of independence and economic success through hard work, rugged individualism and personal responsibility rather then depending on the government.  Steele points out very clearly that these government programs were largely established because of white guilt. Further, this lack of moral authority based on white guilt facilitates Black Americans' claim of perpetual Victimhood.  In fact, it helped to create the modern civil rights industry in which the so-called leaders hold America in perpetual hostage to its own guilt. This book is an absolute \"must read\" because it crystallizes these issues in clear and convincing detail.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>White Guilt: Today, Tomorrow, and Forever.</td><td>5.0</td><td>Shelby Steele, in his new book, White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era, expounds upon the mindset of both groups while exploring our nation's obsession with race. He outlines the interplay between white guilt and black power along with the pernicious effects this dynamic has upon both populations. The author grew up in a time when discrimination was not a shadowy thing. He witnessed it firsthand at baseball practice, and in his father's having to deal with the customs of the southern towns they'd visit. Throughout the text, Steele combines remembrance with observation as a means to elucidate interracial relations. He defines white guilt as being a complete vacuum of moral authority wherein a stigma is cast upon an entire group of people regardless of what they do or say. In the 1960s, it flourished in whites due to the very real historical wrongs of segregation and slavery. By the end of that decade, due to the growing passivity of whites, the black leadership no longer echoed Dr. King. They became radicalized, and there was no shortage of white politicians, intellectuals, and glitterati (recall Leonard Bernstein) ready to sprawl before their collective feet and regain their moral goodness. For many Caucasians, irrational hate for your own race and your ancestors has now become a mechanism for self-esteem and purity. When aggression meets submission the result is slaughter, and that's exactly what has happened to the pride of white America over the course of the last four decades. Rage has become the preferred weapon for obtaining concessions from white politicians, and shame prevents rational minds from protesting these tactics. Steele compares the state of many whites to that of Kafka's main character in The Trial, who is guilty of a crime solely because he has been accused. Black activists insisted that acquiring skills and education alone are not acceptable solutions; our government must actively raise them up. This demand is a reason why so many ashen faced elites embrace \"diversity\" and affirmative action. It allows them to acquire power while amassing feelings of personal superiority. The government internalized the stigma and dishonor of the majority population, and flooded black neighborhoods with lakes of redemptive spending. That the programs and grants issued were ineffective, or even made things worse, was largely irrelevant as the actions were designed to restore feelings of righteousness in politicians and their appointees. In the opinion of this reviewer, what keeps racial tensions high in America are intra-race conflicts as opposed to the interracial ones. Most likely, if one group of Caucasians discontinued the practice of systematically defaming all other Caucasians then the strains among us would diminish. The alchemizing of racism from discussions concerning taxation and personal choice does little more than poison our air. When blacks are free from the conspiracy theories and psychologizing of a power obsessed white elite, we will all get along much better. Ultimately, the best practice for individuals is to treat others as your equals. Modifying your speech and pretending strangers are sensitive to your every syllable is just absurd. The solution to racial problems is not to kow-tow to certain groups and apologize for crimes you never personally committed; instead, we should simply treat other people with respect no matter where they lie on the diversity flowchart. Skin color has nothing to do with personality or worth. Just as one can be certain that segregation and slavery occurred, one can also be certain that the Lester Maddoxes, Orval Faubuses, and Theodore Bilbos are long dead and will never rise again. It is now an excellent time to bury white guilt along with them.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>A Must Read</td><td>5.0</td><td>Absolute must read for the small to mid-sized business owner or manager.  Gerber looks at the root cause of business failure - the owner's desire to work IN the business rather than ON it - and provides a common sense approach to looking at the business in a different way - that of a replicatable series of systems rather than an extension of the owner. Critical to Gerber's thinking is that each business can be run similar to a franchise model - where the customer experience is consistent, the talent and skill required to run the business is minimized, and the approach is well documented and easily learned. The role of the owner is to view their business as a potential franchise, begin with the end in mind, and start building a business system that will deliver consistently for all stakeholders.

But, just like us, she was getting too big to fit in restaurant booths, and I am sure she was just as embarassed when the seat belt on an airplane didn't fit.  She does seem to gloss over the potential nastiness of surgery you need to know about.  But, she has a super-positive attitude. There is a whole section of recipes for fish which I don't eat at all, but there are a lot of recipes to help gag down protein powder, which are great to have. The BEST book I have read was \"The Real Skinny on Weight Loss Surgery\".  It was realistic, honest, and seemed to include all the nasty details you need to hear.  The next best book is \"Weight Loss Surgery, Finding the Thin Person Hiding Inside You!\" by Barbara Thompson.

Oh, and by the way, my husband is very rich and I get to eat out at fancy restaurants and travel a lot. And I mean a LOT.\" I agree with the reviewers who thought the author glossed over the struggles and suffering many gastric bypass patients face, making it sound like life post-surgery is all cake (sugar-free, of course) and roses. I also agree that this author is positively obsessed with food. I am a post-rny patient and cannot yet eat even half of the meals she describes so rapturously. The only reason I gave it two stars is that I read it right before my surgery (although, I must mention, this was AFTER I had already made the decision to have it; this book is too one-sided to help with the surgery decision-making process) and it really psyched me up for my surgery and made me feel very upbeat about it.

It is one of the most moral books ever written. Easily at the top of his canon and likely, the only one of his works that will stand the test of time (although much of his work is great and relevant). Most people are familiar with the central character, Billy Pilgrim, and how he time travels back and forth, with the help of aliens, between his experiences in WWII (largely, the author's) and his comfortable suburban life in the 1960's. But, don't let this sci-fi device fool you into thinking the story is light hearted: its not. Vonnegut is a very eclectic writer who often uses various tricks and slights-of-hand to make a point, or sometimes, to structure an entire work. In this book, you can view Billy's time travel and his interactions with the aliens as metaphors for trauma. The parallels between some of those experiences and that of soldiers suffering 'shell shock' are very close. He also finds space to make some other points and philosophical musings. One that I found worthwhile was the aliens' ability to view life in its totality without being hindered by linear time. So, for example, if they view a dead man, they think that he's only in a bad way at that point in time, but in other points of time (which all co-exist simultaneously in their quantum perception), he's still doing fine. Some critics have used these musings to say that the novel lacks a moral vision. Or that Vonnegut is not taking grave things, like dying, seriously.  I disagree. I think these other perspectives show the author struggling with ways to make sense of a chaotic world. Much of which, he experienced first hand (as did Heller and JD Salinger, curiously). With the current hostilities which abound in the world, this book couldn't be more timely. It remains the best cautionary tale about war (with all due respect to \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"Catch 22\" and \"Red Badge of Courage\") and a great reminder of the horror and futility of unnecessary war acts. As a resident of the world's top military power, I'd say this book should be mandatory reading everywhere!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Excellent / A MUST HAVE for Bariactric Patients</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you are thinking of having Bariatric surgery or are post-op, this book is a MUST-HAVE\"!

Offstage drama--the sudden disappearance of Adelaide, the diva--puts the show in peril. Adelaide, thanks to her robust appetite, has been captured in a humane mouse trap. The young son of the theater's new owner hands the trap to a truck driver, who dumps it onto a snow bank in Brooklyn.

She is saved from Scud, a thuggish rat, by Henry, a mousy professor who specializes in mouse lore. Henry (with other mice and unknowing humans) helps Adelaide to regain the stage in time for her big number. The cast and audience go wild, as they assumed they'd never see her again.

Chichi had stolen five hundred dollars from him earlier--was she interested in stealing more now? Or did she have some other motive--one connected with the obsessive way she watched the Molena Point shops, taking notes on who left when, and what guards were available? Joe's life gets a lot more complicated when he learns that someone is trapping wild cats--specifically the wild cats that made up the pack (clowder) that Kit, one of the three Molena Point talking cats, had once belonged to. The Molena Point police are used to getting tips from unnamed informants who seem to observe things no human could observe, but this time, it's the cats who might need help from the cops, rather than the other way around. Because the thieves planning a major crime spree in Molena Point are the same criminals who are capturing sapient cats, planning on selling them for some television show or Hollywood movie. And they aren't going to limit themselves to just wild cats--Joe, Dulcie, and the Kit are targets as well. Author Shirley Rousseau Murphy delivers another of her charming talking-cats stories. Despite Chichi's interference, the romantic lives of the human characters are settling down. Charlie is newly married to Chief of Police Max Harper, and Clyde is dating Ryan. The lives of the cats are in more of a disarray. The Kit longs for the wildness of her youth, despite the attraction that human love offers--along with the human food she craves. Joe Gray and Dulcie feel a responsibility for the wild sapient cats who have been captured, and of course, the need to learn what secrets Chichi is hiding.

I was very much surprised when I got into this book. Joe Grey is one of these talking cats that has several other \"talking\" cats around him much of the time.  Of course these cats have to be very careful not to speak when other humans are near.  Only certain people they know well can know they talk.

I also found the presentation a bit redundant. Having said that, this book presents two very important concepts that bear repeating: 1) You can't (and shouldn't if you could) do it all. 2) A truly successful business must be able to run without the owner present. Mr. Gerber correctly points out the way to implement the latter is to preplan for growth and implement systems that are documented in a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual that are simple enough for an entry level employee to follow. Easier said than done. Mr. Gerber doesn't address how the small business owner already working 70+ hours per week in his or her business is supposed to find the time to do the kind of detailed process workflow analysis required to produce such a document.  No matter that the need for doing so is evidently clear. Nor does Mr. Gerber address the obvious capital requirements necessary, even if one can find the time, to get the job done. Time is money and time and money are the two precious resources most small business owners have the least of.  This is a classic catch-22 situation where it's imperative that business owners systematize their operations but lack the resources to accomplish the task. Perhaps a great companion book for the author to write would be a meaningful blueprint for implementing the good advice found in E-Myth Revisited. Or perhaps the author could add a chapter or two to the existing book. Either way I give it four stars for not providing enough content to support an otherwise salient concept. It would also be helpful if his example business owner wasn't so docile and one dimensional.

I had read a few of his short stories and was already impressed with his status as a writer.  I would've never expected what I experienced when I read \"Slaughterhouse-Five.\"  It's hard to put into words that'll actually do this masterpiece the justice it deserves, but I will try. Listen:  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.  This meaning that he relives certain moments of his life in random order like a scrambled movie.  He has absolutely no control over it whatsoever and he never knows what part of his life he'll have to reenact.  The majority of the moments that we witness take place during his involvement in WW2 as a POW and also when he is taken aboard an alien spaceship with creatures known as \"Tralfamadorians.\"  There is no ending for Billy Pilgrim.  He witnesses his beginning as well as death... and then the show starts all over again in a continuous loop throwing Pilgrim into random segments of his life. Reading this novel was a completely new experience to me.  I had never read anything like it, and now I know that I will never again read anything like it, as there is no way the book can be successfully duplicated by others.  Vonnegut is able to take a serious matter (such as war) and still throw in a balanced sense of humor that will take you by surprise.  The book pokes fun at just about anything you can imagine while still showing respect and care to the main subject matter.  The story is outrageously subtle and unpredictable.  This novel is a very easy read and once you begin it, you won't want to put it down until you have finished it.  Vonnegut is one talented writer with a very unique sense of style that I have never witnessed in any other book. One thing that people will probably dislike about the book is how confusing it can be at times.  Since the book jumps around and is not in order, you have to always be thinking and paying attention to every detail.  It's very easy to forget what has already happened and what has yet to happen since it is in scrambled order.  However, this is what really makes the book that much more special.  You'll want to reread it again for this very reason, as you'll most likely miss a few things with the first read.  It wasn't very hard for me to keep track of what was going on since I found the book to be so involving. While this is indeed a classic, because of the strange manner that the book is written in, it will most likely not appeal to everybody.  This is a risk-taking work of literature that is bound to not have everybody loving it.  Still, I think it's worth anybody's time to pick it up and give it a chance.  \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is a rare find that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire time.  You'll never know what to expect next.  A very touching, funny, sad and dark story about a flawed entity known as \"human-beings.\"  This has very quickly become a new favorite of mine, without question. -Michael Crane</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Skipping this book is NOT an option.</td><td>5.0</td><td>Even though Michael Gerber's writing style can have a tendency to drive people up a wall with his telling you the same thing over and over and over and over and using far more words than is necessary, read this book. If you are in business or are thinking about starting about business, reading this book no longer becomes an option for you, it is a must. Anyone who has ever failed in business will be astounded as Gerber describes, with razor sharp precision, exactly what went wrong. Here, you will learn how to never make those same mistakes again. You will learn how to run your business instead of letting your business run you. One of the things I appreciate most about this book is how much of what Gerber teaches are the same lessons needed for life itself. In much of what you read here, you could replace the word \"business\" with words like \"life\" or \"marriage\" and the same rules would apply. In fact, as a minister, I employ much of what Gerber teaches here in my marriage counseling. The same principles of primary aims, strategic objectives, organizational objectives, management objectives and system strategies.

I usually can get through novels fairly quickly, but this one was just hard work to get through.  There are spots where the story is well written and it movies at a good pace.  Then it is like another author takes over and you find yourself just bogged down in the random details, the fragmented story line and well, just the poor writing skills. As far as a classic goes, this one does not ring any bells for me.  If you're wondering if I'd suggest buying it, no.  There are way too many other good books out there to invest your money in.

Gerber thinks all small businesses should operate with a franchise mentality; that is, basing the business on repeatable, profitable systems rather than on the personality of the owner. This is fine as far as it goes, but when Gerber puts all these elements of process (strategy, management, hr, marketing, sales, etc.) into a series of one-size-fits-all formulas, I think he is overreaching. Depending on a company's product/service, personnel, market, and a slew of other factors, these formulas may need quite an overhaul to fit the company's needs.  That said, the book is loaded with words of wisdom.  A few examples-- \"Adolescence begins at the point in the life of your business when you decide to get some help.\" \"To The Entrepreneur, the business is the product.\" \"It is literally impossible to produce a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people.  No business can do it for long.  And no extraordinary business tries to!\" \"Most companies organize around personalities rather than functions.\" Some readers may discover a great deal about themselves as they read. Gerber says entrepreneurs have three mentalities--the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.  These mentalities are always in conflict, and the way in which the owner balances them determines the success or failure of the business.  If E-Myth helps owners figure out how to achieve a better balance, that insight will go further towards building the business than all Gerber's systems put together.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Better read as biography, less as treatise on universalism</td><td>4.0</td><td>What appeals to me most about this book and their first is the personal component of the authors' spiritual journies from wounds dealt them by fundamentalism at an early age. Not everyone responds to a bad fundamentalist experience with the theological stances these authors do. Frankly, I think the stories within these two books are possibly better seen as the authors' biographies than as theological treatises on universalism. The books seem to me to lack a strong forensic or philosophical basis for their teaching; there are serious questions they could pursue in a way as to make their point less anecdotally and more qualitatively. Obviously viewing their work purely as anecdotal doesn't allow a reader to entirely circumvent the beliefs they advocate, but I think an approach from them that was biographic as to their own journey of faith would perhaps yield very similar books with what they hold out now as dogma being more tentatively held out as questions.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>If God Is Love: Rediscovering Grace in an Ungracious World</td><td>5.0</td><td>Mr. Gulley has done it again!!

This book comes in a time of Vonnegut's writing career where he was both a great teacher and a great artist. This is a culmination of those teachings, put together in a uniquely artistic manner. The story is an anti-war exploration of the meaning of life. Rather, as the back covers proclaims, it is an odyssey through time. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, hops back and forth among his memories (in time) in an effort to put together the fractured reality which exists there. Along the way, Vonnegut creates resonances which make for superb reading. I don't think I overstate the case when I call it brilliant. Pilgrim, in this odyssey, finds that time does not proceed linearly, as we perceive it. Time merely is. If an event exists, it always exists since there is no past, present, nor future. Pilgrim learns this when he is abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Another tidbit he learns is that war is unavoidable. However, war doesn't exist in every moment in time, so the Tralfamadorians choose to visit those moments when there is no war. On one hand, this is an absurd statement for an anti-war book. If Pilgrim finds that war is inevitable, how are we to believe we can avoid situations like Dresden? I don't think this is Vonnegut's message, exactly. Tralfamadorians choose to spend their conscious time in moments when war isn't. Since we live linearly, we should likewise choose to exist in moments when there is no war. If we could, most of us would choose to spend our time in moments of peace. So perhaps war is inevitable, but we don't need to live through it right now. It's hard for me to imagine anyone who wouldn't like this book. I suppose if you were too young to understand, it may be unthrilling. Aside from that, you can assume that war hawks will dismiss it as gibberish, since Vonnegut does not portray war as glorious. As strange as it sounds, Vonnegut would probably call it gibberish too. An excellent book, even if it is gibberish.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>I didn't really find anything helpful and instead felt like the author spend more time bragging about how great ...</td><td>2.0</td><td>I didn't really find anything helpful and instead felt like the author spend more time bragging about how great he was instead of actually making any salient points.

So it goes.</td><td>4.0</td><td>For a truly surreal reading experience, it doesn't get much better than Kurt Vonnegut's seminal science fiction/drama novel \"Slaughterhouse Five\".  Ostensibly an anti-war novel, \"Slaughterhouse Five\" transports the readers to many different places and times following the journey of the unimpressive Billy Pilgrim.  Billy is a sad, pathetic individual who seems to have spent almost all of his existence just mindlessly wandering from one station in life to the next without much enthusiasm for it or even much interest.  He's the kind of person that, if you saw him walking down the street or met him at a party, he would leave absolutely no impression.  Billy, like many in his generation, served in World War II.  The story (stories) of this novel center on the Dresden fire bombings in the last days of the war and his survival in an underground shelter, the aforementioned 'slaughterhouse five'.  He survived the war, went back home, became an optometrist, got married, and had a life with all the trappings of suburbia.  None of it really seems to matter to him, though.  He would have been content to die in WWII for he did not want to fight.  He was joke to those that served with him in a German POW camp.  Even in his own life back home, Billy wasn't much.  He married relatively unattractive woman because that's what people did.  His colleagues didn't have much respect for him, nor did his own children in later years.  So, what was Billy Pilgrim's purpose for existing?  He seemed to think it was to spread the message of an alien race about becoming 'unstuck in time'.   \"Slaughterhouse Five\" departs from any semblance of normal story-telling formats.  As Billy Pilgrim has become 'unstuck in time', he feels he exists in an environment where, instead of time being one chronological line, it is a series of points that exist concurrently and perpetually.  Billy falls asleep a widower and wakes up on his wedding day.  He may revisit his war experience or go back to childhood.  Billy journeys all over time because, where he's concerned, everything that has happened and will happen is all happening at the same time.  Perhaps it is the influence of the aliens that enable him to think this way, or perhaps Billy is really just suffering from severe post-traumatic stress following the Dresden bombing.  Either way, Billy is missing something in his life.  His journeys through time are his way to try and find meaning in a life where none exists.  It is a unique and existential journey for the reader and one definitely worth taking.  So it goes.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>My daughter is RAVING over this book!</td><td>5.0</td><td>My 11-year-old daughter is dictating this to me:  \"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

That was just one of the many tidbits I gained from listening to this marvelous program; among the others: * Ask the question, What do you want to be? (As opposed to the question, What do I want to do?) * In a small business, 90% of your time should be spent on strategic work and only 10% on tactical work. Most businesses reverse these figures. * We don't have to motivate people, we need to inspire them. * Hire people by running ads not like anybody else; e.g., this one: We want people with passion, we want people with heart. When you get a bunch of people who are interested, bring them all at once in to a hiring seminar to listen to your story.

He has been hanging out for quite some time around the lake and won't let any human being get anywhere near him. Clearly, his experiences with humans have been of an abusive nature. Twelve-year-old Charley doesn't need to take on his problems. She has problems enough of her own. She is only now able to walk after a car accident several months before. She lost her mother to a plane crash when she was ten. Her father spends most of his time at the office. She has built a new life around friends and town life, movies and the mall. Except that her best friend has left for the summer and she has been out of contact with the rest of her classmates since the accident. Charley is not a dog person, has never had one, has never thought about having one. But this dog, who is nothing but skin and bones and matted fur, pulls at her heart. Even though he plays happily with the other dogs around the lake, she senses a need in him for human attachment. It compels her to give him food, shelter, love. She names him Coyote and as she draws him nearer and nearer to her home and her heart, the healing process begins for both of them.

In the very first paragraph of this book the names of two different movie stars are mis-spelled.  I can just imagine how much care went into the proofreading of the hundreds of obscure names that flow from Wolfe's pen.  Over and over again, the misspellings and the solecisms astound.  On the third page, we find out about \"Edgar Bergin.\"  Nice one, Wolfe.  You're supposed to be the Beverly Hills boy who KNEW all these people.  How about page 114: \"It was inferred in the press . . . \"  You know you want to say \"implied,\" but something just won't let you, will it? Actually the methodology of this book is almost exactly the same as that of Wolfe's last best-seller, in which he \"proved\" who killed Marilyn Monroe.  Just blame the most famous person you can think of.  He did it.  It's the same case here.  I love the two tables that prove it.  First table is, \"Facts we know about the Black Dahlia Killer.\"  Second heading is, \"Facts we know about [Wolfe's Suspect].\"  C'mon, Mr. Wolfe, didn't you get just a little bit of a chuckle stret-t-t-ch-ch-ch-i-ng Table Two to make it match Table One.  It's ludicrous on the face of it, and then you have to go drag in Robert Slatzer again!  The man who claimed to be Marilyn Monroe's second husband, the man who solved your first case, solves it again here! As for your dismissal of Hodel's book, think again.  You have dismissed nothing; however, you make it clear that you don't think the two photos Dr. Hodel left behind show Elizabeth Short in them.  But you'd have to say that, wouldn't you, for your theory to be true? There's much to love about Wolfe's book however, and he brings out a lot of information that I've never heard of before, and also some interesting theoretical tidbits.  The story of the man who was nearly arrested by LA police, the aspiring crime writer, Leslie Dillon, is chilling in the way it shows a right-wing police force slowly closing in their grip on any innocent person who comes their way and can be made into a scapegoat.  I recommend the book, but keep a bit of salt handy while plowing through it. Does anyone really think that Thelma Todd was killed by the same man who killed Elizabeth Short?  Wolfe does. Does anyone think that when Kirk Douglas dies we will finally find out the truth of what happened to all those women in the 1940s, like Jean Spangler?  It's lurid, but Wolfe puts it out there, repeating the 'rumors' that have surrounded Douglas' reputation for decades.  Face it, in the Dahlia business, there are no angels, except for Robert Slatzer of course, and except for John Gilmore, who's probably still cooing like a dove after the ass kissing he gets from Wolfe. And come on, those interrogations prove absolutely nothing.  The poor schnooks are there being given the third degree, asked nothing but leading questions, some of which they hesitantly agree with.  That's not proof if you ask me.  You can call them \"secret DA files\" if you want, to me it's just coerced and halfhearted testimony from people who knew nothing of the case.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Fails in Comparison</td><td>3.0</td><td>Earlier this year, I read Skeleton Man by Joseph Bruchac with one of my lower reading groups and loved it.

And then I read it. The Return of Skeleton Man fails in comparison to its first installment.  For the first half of the book, Molly basically recounts her story from the first novel telling the reader over and over what they probably already know of the story.  I found that her parents, not kidnapped this time by Skeleton Man, did not add to the story in the least. Finally, when Skeleton Man made his appearance in the last third of the book, it was anticlimactic.  The basic running through the woods away form the bad guy hit its peak with a lackluster showdown in the woods. I do still like the fact that Molly shows a strong female character and role model for children.  She uses her brain and faith to overcome obstacles, but this second installment of the series (I am assuming there will be another one, even after the author bashes horror movie series that showcase a mythical and invincible antagonist) falls short of expectations.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Dahlia fan must read</td><td>5.0</td><td>As a long-time researcher of the Black Dahlia case I have read everything that is published and a ton of unpublished work about the crime, the victim and the many hypotheses on the case.

Wolfe has come closer than anybody before him to determining what actually happened to Beth Short on January 14-15, 1947. If he's correct, he also explains the mystery of the murder of Bugsy Seigel. Bugsy Seigel's murder as explained in Dean Jennings' book We Only Kill Each Other, has never made much sense to me. The Flamingo Resort Casino, which was in a bad way in January of 1947 at the time of Beth Short's death, by June, when Seigel was killed, was already beginning to pay for itself. In Robert Lacy's book Little Man, the authorized biography of Meyer Lansky, written with the cooperation of the Lansky family, Meyer Lansky swore he never harmed his friend and partner, Ben Seigel. Outside of his being a gangster, why would he lie about it at the end of his life? The coinciding of Seigel's return to Los Angeles from Vegas expressly to raise money, with the MacCadden jewelry robberies and burgalries that took place in LA over those days, and the return of Beth Short from San Deigo on January 9th, an explaination starts to take shape. The coroner's report tells us that Beth Short was NOT tortured to death. She was killed by blunt force trauma to the side of her head by a metal instrument, and having her mouth slashed open. So the wounds inflicted to the body were made postmortum. This was a practical crime made to look like a crime of passion. Who would do something like this? Who would have the audacity to mutilate a body like that and then drop it off in a residential neighborhood a short walk from the home of LA crime boss Jack Dragna? Wolfe's theory makes a lot of circumstantial sense. We know from John Gilmore's book Severed that even LAPD believes that Jack Anderson Wilson, killed when his hotel room caught fire days after Gilmore's first article about him appeared in an LA paper, was present at the murder of the Black Daliah. But the specifics of the crime make it unlikely that Wilson was the only person involved. His own apparent murder makes one wonder, who is still alive who wants to maintain the secrecy around the motive and circumstances of Beth Short's death? From Dennis McDougal's book, Privileged Son we know that Norman Chandler, owner of the LA Times at the time of Short's murder, lived a scandlous secret life and,along with Ben Seigel, played a very close game with the corrupt LAPD of that day. I think Wolfe's solution is highly probable and expect that as more confidential files are made public we will eventually learn what happened to the Black Daliah.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Incredibly involving and darkly humorous</td><td>5.0</td><td>Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is one of the finest books I've ever read. I want to extend my deepest thanks to my girl Meredith for placing it in my borrowing hands. It's a fabulous reading experience that when explained verbally makes no sense. I'm sure that my breakdown of the plot structure didn't make anyone want to read it, but my neverending enthusiasm for the brilliance of the writer and all he accomplished in the 200+ pages of text probably did. Vonnegut is a genius of prose, and he handles a story that jumps back and forth through time and space like a kangaroo with a porcupine in its pouch with a delicate touch of dark humor that treads the boundary of the nearly ludicrous, but always stays this side of believable. It's an astonishing piece of anti-war sentiment that examines the life of Billy Pilgrim through the 4-dimensional eyes of time, seeing time and events therein as something that have always happened, is happening, and will always happen. This sets the time-hopping structure of the book. The book is rooted in Billy Pilgrim's situation as a prisoner of war, held captive first in a run down little camp that is pretty much headed by the distinguished Englishmen who have come to know the Nazi soldiers as comrades in arms, and then he is moved to Dresden, Germany; the site of a massacre that the combined destructive power of which took more lives than the Hiroshima bomb. We find out that Billy Pilgrim also became a optometrist, married a rich woman, and may or may not have been taken to a planet called Tralfamadore to be put on display in a zoo for the interest of the planet's inhabitants, who teach Billy about the true nature of time. I couldn't explain how or why this book drew me in with such power, but there is no doubt in my mind of its greatness. Vonnegut uses his characters to the anti-war angle splendidly, gives us some new perspectives about time to think about, and he sort of makes us feel guilty for wanting to chuckle at the snide moments of obscure humor he throws at us like eggs, and we're all the dumb football jock's car. It's a wonderful balancing act of psychological profiling, satire, theory, and love. This is a true timeless masterpiece.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Very interesting book on several levels</td><td>4.0</td><td>Over the years, I've read a few accounts of the Black Dahlia/Elizabeth Short murder case, including novels which it inspired (True Confessions by Dunne and Elroy's LA Quartet). This case will continue to fascinate because of the dramatic elements involved in real life: the LA Noir scene of the '40s and '50s, the Mob, the Hollywood connection, corrupt cops and politicians, a complicit DA. This is a case that is more fascinating than fiction, and because the LA law enforcement authorities resolutely keep the documentation secret they allow all kinds of speculation to continue to flourish. Wolfe's book neatly capitalizes on this. It is a highly readable book that captures the essence of the era; the post-war naievete of the public, the dewy-eyed optimism of the naifs drawn to the lure of Hollywood fame, the sleaze of the LA power-mongers. It captures a time when people could still be shocked by a gruesome murder, something sadly lost in the era of OJ Simpson, the Menendez brothers, and the Night Stalker. It is an era of lost innocence. Whether or not Wolfe has truly \"solved\" the case is hard to say. He paints a pretty convincing picture. But then you have to realize that though he obtained access to some investigative material not previously available, it's only some -- not all -- of the official records. Further material is provided to him in interviews with a very few of the players who are still alive over 50 years after the fact. Time dims and distorts memory; people lie when they know others who can prove their statements false are dead; one of Wolfe's sources (a self-confessed participant) was an alcoholic with a fried brain. Then, from the material provided to him Wolfe further extrapolates to reach his conclusions. At least a couple of his conclusions, particularly as to the involvement of a well-known Mob figure, seem to be a stretch. It may well be that this case will only be finally put to rest when the LAPD releases all of the contemporary documentation, and maybe not even then. In the meantime, Wolfe's book does present a very credible theory in a very readable and enjoyable fashion that's as interesting as almost anything written by Raymond Chandler.

His thesis is that the system runs the business and the people run the system.  While the theory sounds good, I'd say the implementation is a quick way to turn your company into a souless corporate machine. Maybe I'm just bitter.  Maybe it's cause I just bailed out on a job, read this, and then found out that this book was their guiding philosophy.  Maybe it's cause I read Fast Food Nation first. I dunno.  Whatever the case, I think this book, in the non-critical hands, is a quick path to creating a souless empire.  Just another best-buy or ticketmaster, or any other company that has distilled it's essance into a bunch of scripts and guides. That said, I do think this book is a \"must read\" if only to contast other business books you've read.  I don't think it's the holy grail of business, but it has very good advise.  Hence, three stars.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The author's cure is worse than the disease!</td><td>1.0</td><td>The author is great at presenting anecdotes of the ills of America's failing healthcare system.  But his proposed cure is worse than the disease.  His premise is that the capitalist method is bad, and only the socialist method of health care will correct all ills.  While it's true the capitalist system is far from perfect, and the US health care system in crises, a socialist takeover of healthcare is NOT the answer.  The only people who love that are the Big Brother politicians and the activist who want to rob from the rich.   Unfortunately for any serious reader, the author only examines and chronicles the ills of private health centers.  He completely ignores the ills of government run health care systems.  (I've been in some ... they are SCARY places indeed.)   The idea of the government -- the same one gave us the Katrina mess -- should take on health care and manage and control all doctors, hospitals and research is not a good idea.  Just look how politicians are interfering in and bungling medical marijuana, physician assisted suicide and abortion.  Anything that puts politicians (mostly all lawyers) in charge of doctors and medical science is very scary indeed.   The main reason the author's central premise is fundamentally flawed, he assumes that the ONLY way to get to universal coverage is through government run health care.  But that clearly is not true.  Everyone agrees that universal coverage is good.  We simply disagree on how to get there.  But we could very easily get there simply by preventing insurance companies from their current practices of excluding certain people based on their health status, and their efforts to deny coverage to covered persons based on obscure policy rules as judged by a claims adjuster.  This one simple rule change -- full coverage, with no discriminating against anyone based on their health status -- would dramatically change the coverage landscape.  If we prohibited such discrimination, saying insurance companies can only charge one price for all of their customers, must cover everything considered \"medically necessary\" as judged by the DOCTOR (not a politician!), and can never deny coverage to anyone who can pay the premium, then we would grow to universal coverage very quick.  It would take us back to the original premise of insurance, which is to spread the risk.  The profit incentive then, rather than trying to exclude poor or sick people, instead would be to bring as many people into the program as possible to spread the risk.  The problem of universal coverage would be solved without having to take on a huge government takeover of medical care as the author suggest.  But this, and other such solutions, are not even considered or examined. Another major flaw with this book, it examines in detail why insurers do not have people's health at heart, but then leaps over gaps in logic to conclude that government will do better, without examining other alternatives.  While the arguments presented against insurers interfering with coverage are sound, it apparently never occurs to the author that there's a whole other group of people who could do a better job of handling our health care than either insurers or politicians -- namely doctors and health care professionals themselves. This book could be better if it examined whether perhaps the better persons to be in charge of health care would be, not politicians or insurers, but doctors and health care professionals.  But it doesn't even explore that possibility. Are you ready to trust your politicians to take care of your health instead of your doctor?  If so, then this book is just the pill for you to swallow.  For the rest of us who know better, any book suggesting that your medicine should be delivered to you by politicians all too happy to tax you for the privileges they grant to you is hardly worth the paper on which it is printed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>OK but there are better ones out there</td><td>3.0</td><td>Compared to other books this one contains too much \"fluff\" or in other words success stories.

After getting tired of the \"mainstream\" science fiction genre, I decided to give the much acclaimed Vonnegut a try. First, I must warn that I found some aspects of the book quite depressing.  The characters lead unfufilling, sad lives.  The narrator often cynically dwelled on the mundane.  Suicide was a recurring theme. The good aspects: The narration on the mundane was interesting and gave the kinds of perspectives (albeit cynical and erratic) not shared in most other sci-fi novels. The novel did not progress in the standard linear fashion, with the narration frequently relating events to ones that had yet to take place.  This made the novel's parts fit together quite well. The novel had some extra randomness.  Not all events are conveniently constructed to aid the story.  Some things don't happen \"for a reason\", they just happen.  That's life. There is nothing cliche in the novel.  Vonnegut has created something original. I plan to read another of Vonnegut's novels soon.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Excellent - Much Needed!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Gerber addresses how to make your business work for you instead of you working for your business.

Gerber explain the typical mentality of a small business owner and how to change your thinking and avoid the common pitfalls. I found it eye-opening.

After doing something about the mess we had, starting to follow a system and given specific tasks and formats to fill now we are organized to work and a much better follow up of our clients. The following step is to establish a broader system in order to be able to let the business running by itself, a business not requiring me stay here all day long. And, now after reading the book, I know how to do it. The only thing I didn't think is right in this book is that Gerber assumes that a seller may follow a system, not necessarily caring about the feelings of clients, and yet be a good seller.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Excellent book on changing the mind-set.</td><td>4.0</td><td>This book is an excellent book for changing mind-set of business owners. The book starts by describing many problematic areas that small business owners may have especially those owners whose background are not in the business but more technical oriented. Then, the book stresses the importance of developing a solid system, where the business process are well designed, and thought-of. As a business owner myself with a technical background, I found it to be a fun book to read. It requires technician-type owners to think more on the business side rather than technical side. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a mind-set change. However, this book focuses more on business systems, processes and management, it does not provide systematic suggestions or solutions on marketing or sales, which I believe small biz owners need most. Also, this book uses too many stories to illustrate just one idea, which is too wordy. All in all, this book worth its value. With its price just a little over ten bucks, this book can change the mind-set of a technician-type biz owner, and possbily benefit or even re-shape the course of your business in the future.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Another Winner From Kurt</td><td>5.0</td><td>Galapagos strikes me as one of Kurt Vonnegut's funniest and most well-written novels. The writing is, of course, quit witty, but even moreso here than usual. This book also contains what is a semi-rarity for Vonnegut: a coherent plot. True, it's still not told in linear fashion (this is Vonnegut, after all), and few Vonnegut fans would want it that way, anyhow. The book is a page turner because of the way it is written... like in several of his other books, Kurt mentions events that happen later in the narrarative early on, and uses this as a fairly enticing suspense maneuver. The story and theme elements themselves are interesting: de-evolution (plus such related things as genetics, and all things Darwin), the environment, and more. Although this is not his best book (I still refer to Cat's Cradle as that), this book is well-written, coherent, funny, witty, and less fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants than most of Vonnegut's oeuvre, and thus, in fact a pretty good place for newbies to the author to start.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>So it goes.</td><td>5.0</td><td>Listen:  Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is really something else. I have to admit this is one of the few books where I saw the movie first (years ago), and about 3 years ago, I decided to read the novel. Left a deep impact on me, although I had a hard time understanding it.  So a couple of months ago I saw the movie again, loved it again (although I normally detest movies done after books), and then decided to read all of Vonnegut's novels and shortstories, and chronologically this time, starting out with the promising Player Piano.  Now I reread Slaughterhouse Five, and so far it is Vonnegut's best book. It is clearly an attempt to describe his impressions in World War Two and especially Dresden, but instead of writing a realistic novel about war, Vonnegut 'invents' a totally non-linear genre of science fiction that is absolutely unique in its scope.  There is no suspense at all, because the novel's main character (not to call him hero) Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, which means he travels back and forth in time. We meet a young Pilgrim traumatized by his gun-loving father, a Pilgrim lost in World War Two, a Pilgrim married to the obese daughter of a rich John Birch Society nutcase and above all a happy Pilgrim living on Tralfamadore, a planet in a faraway solar system. All this is narrated in no particular order, and maybe the book needs to be read twice to get its scope, but it is worth it.  Vonnegut's style also reaches a level that I haven't seen of him in the past, very bitter-sarcastic-loving-sweet... all at once. Every death is followed by a shrugged \"So it goes.\", and paragraphes are often introduced with \"Listen:\". In a heartwarming sad tale, Vonnegut tells us not only of the senselessness of war (where there are no crooks, just victims), but also teaches the reader a valuable moral: focus on the positive moments of your life.  Then there are some characters which avid Vonnegut fans will love to see back: wretched sci-fi writer Kilgore Trout, millionaire Eliot Rosewater and American nazi Howard Campbell jr. Plus two goofs: the border between Luxembourg and Germany is a valley, not a hill, and people with an IQ of 103 are of average intelligence, not morons.  Read this book though.

Gibson notes the increasing tendency for these and other world nations to lash out at the United States for reasons that have little to do with Iraq but much to do with a disagreeable mixture of insecurity, jealousy, and personal animosity toward an American president who is not bashful about using unilateral force against terrorist regimes.  Ironically, most left wing liberals side with these America bashers even if they fail to point out a substitute course of agreed on action.  What Gibson shows is a widespread and monstrously deep hatred of traditional American values, not the least of which is the right of America to act unilaterally in its own defense.  Gibson does try to explain away the origins of these America haters as originating in the tightly intertwined destiny of the crowded city states of Europe that suffered greatly during the last two world wars and have learned to lean over in a spinebreaking fashion to avoid conflict with one aggressor nation by forging ill-fated alliances with other nations.  The target audience of HATING AMERICA is most likely those who already agree with Gibson.  His style is strident, a message well posited by the title of his closing chapter: \"They're Wrong. We're Right. Get Used to It.\" If hating America is truly the new world sport, then Gibson's book goes a long way toward fanning the fires of a rivalry that will easily eclipse the next Red Sox incursion into Yankee Stadium.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Why do we expect to be loved?</td><td>5.0</td><td>\"Tariq Ali, a young writer gained fame in the early 1970s decrying American policy in Vietnam.  By 2003, he had lost none of his youthful anti-Americanism. 'Some of the Bush idealogues in the media compare Washington to ancient Rome.  It is a  permissable fantasy, but they should remember that (a) the Romans never expected to be loved and (b) that Rome, too, fell.'\" (page 70) There is truth in that statement, as Gibson points out, much as we hate to hear it.  Americans want to be loved.  When the Brits ruled the world, they never expected to be admired--only obeyed and, perhaps, feared.  We, on the other hand, want desperately to be liked.  But the hand that holds out the food, and rules, is usually hated, and often bitten.  That is just a fact of life that one must expect. John Gibson has written an awesome compilation of facts here supporting his thesis that we, the most powerful nation on earth, are vastly despised, despite all of the sacrifices we have made in blood and money in the last century to make the world better.  Are we surprised then, that France, whom we have saved from the despotism and horror of two world wars, is among our most ardent foes?  Or the Palestinians, whom we have striven to achieve justice for during a couple of generations, holds an abiding hatred for us?  Or the Germans, Belgians, South Koreans, Spanish, Italians--all of Europe (for whom we have bled copiously), in fact, hold us in contempt or, at least distrust us? Even the Brits, our most trusted allies, look down on us as springing from an inferior civilization. As they said in the Second World War, while we were bleeding for their sake, it was said that the greatest fault of the Yanks were that we were, \"Overfed, overpaid, oversexed and over here.\"  No gratitude, even then in the midst of battle. But, when all is said and done, at least for the moment (which is about as long as any political system lasts in the overall scheme of things), as Gibson points out we are the most powerfful nation on earth, militarily and economically.  We have, at least for now, achieved that status while France, Spain, Italy and Russia have declined until they are no longer the masters of their own fate: the victims of socialism.  Even the proud British Empire, upon which it was once said that \"the sun never sets,\" is now a mere shadow of its former glory. The United States of America may not be far behind, as the ugly head of socialism rears its head, replacing our constitutional freedoms to a greater and greater extent.  But for now, at least, we are the force with which to be reckoned--the one of which to be jealous--we are the source of power. It is not, therefore, ours to be loved.  Rather, it is ours to be respected, if for no other reason than our strength.  That must be enough, for now.  They will, no doubt, gloat when we fall, and perhaps when and if we are as weak as they, then they will love us.  Doubtful?  Who knows? This is a fine book, psychoanalyzing our avowed enemies. and explaining how they got to be that way.  I recommend it.  John Gibson is the host of Fox News Channel's The Big Story. God Bless America.

He effortlessly manages to draw together hugely diverse threads of human experience, ranging from a discussion of Dadaism, Bauhaus, the roots of early 20th Century \"new age\" cults in Germany, right up to observations on the Moroccan who murdered Theo Van Gogh. The only let down with this book is ( in my view ) Burleigh's analysis of Islam as it clashes with modernity -- it's not that I don't agree with his conclusions ( I do agree with him ), but simply that whilst his analysis of fascism and early 20th Century European culture is consistently original and penetrating in its insights -- much of his critique of Islam reads a little like a Daily Mail/Daily Telegraph comment column, and is remarkably pedestrian and rather ordinary in comparison. Also, I have to say, many of his comments on Ireland and the Irish people seem far too sweeping, far too subjective for a man of Burleigh's usual insight and historical training, and are difficult to take seriously. Besides these points then, this is still a commendable book in places. There are very few historians writing in the \"popular\" arena that have so much depth, wisdom, insight to offer, and such narrative mastery as Burleigh.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>\"Helping a Child Sort Feelings....In a Complex Situation\"</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a perfect book for a young school child who may be experiencing some emotional roller coaster feelings.

Without making the situation worse, simple lessons of every day experiences can be shared so as to allow the child to navigate his or her own way through the problem.   The author covers important concepts such as \"trust\", \"respect\", \"trustworthiness\", \"politeness\", \"loyalty\", \"patience\", \"regret\", \"forgiveness\", and \"love\", in the form of manners; we know that the heart is fragile and the child needs to see some kind of concrete illustration of how to handle difficult situations.   Once the book is read, the child will be able to use it as a temporary resource when some uncomfortable feeling creeps in.  The clever dialogue in explaining the term will allow the child to sort out the solution in a way to make it more manageable.

The book deserves 1 star for proposing a standard that most people cannot hope to meet and then pushing to sell you  consulting services.  Pay attention to the former, and go light on the  latter. Gerber is correct that most entrepreneurs are limited by a  comfort zone of wanting to remain in control as either strong technicians  or managers, which limits the potential of the business.  As soon as they  exceed what they can handle, the business either fails in a break-out  attempt or shrinks back to a simpler state.  The new businesses that  succeed the most are the ones that have a business model that is easy to  replicate with ordinary people. Where Gerber goes wrong is in  suggesting that many people can develop such business models.  I regularly  study the top 100 CEOs in the country for stock-price growth, and few of  them think they can develop a new business model.  Why should someone  starting up a new company be likely to do better than that?  They won't.  In fact, I have a friend who attempted to start a new business following  Gerber's principles and almost failed before he adjusted to normal  operating approaches.  He spent so much time developing his business model,  that he never got around to operating it. Gerber's three favorite  examples are McDonald's, Disney, and Fed Ex.  Notice that two of the three  got most of their ideas from someone else for the business model (Ray Kroc  from the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, California and Fred Smith  from an Indian air freight operation). I think there is another fallacy  here:  You can get ordinary people to do simple things (deliver packages,  cook and deliver cheap hamburgers, and smile at people on automated rides).  But in many businesses the demands of the market are extraordinary such as  in many technological product businesses and services.  Microsoft has a  business model, but it is not one that Gerber would recognize. Finally,  he condemns people who want to operate their business as a job by being  technically expert.  Where would we be if people never did that?  What if  Peter Drucker spent all of his time developing business systems to make  pizzas and tacos rather than writing business books about management?  What  if great musicians developed business models for teaching children to play  the violin and piano rather than performing?  In other words, there is room  and a need for extraordinarily able one-person companies run by  technicians. Skip the pitch for the consulting services at the end.  You'll like the book better if you do. But don't let my quibbles keep you  as an entrepreneur from failing to appreciate the excellent case Gerber  makes for having a business model as soon as possible, and working  systematically to improve it.  If you can do that, you may well develop a  true irresistible growth enterprise.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Interesting and Informative, But the Man is a Humanist</td><td>5.0</td><td>His book discusses the politics and science of embryonic stem cell research and genetic engineering.

It is hopeless to refute his brand of atheism because he doesn't believe even in things that don't require belief because we can it is true. On page 59 he says,  \"The conviction that human beings are endowed with such a power [free will] is pervasive, even more so than a belief in the human soul...As a philosophical concept, free will is like an onion whose skin has been completely peeled away: at its core, it ceases to exit.\" Dr. Silver is no friend of religion. He thinks natural selection favors spiritual people, because spiritual tribes (believing in heaven and in serving the community) are more successful in warfare than non-spiritual tribes. (p. 71) On my website is a longer review of his book, and I try to show how irrational Dr. Silver's philosophy is. I think I found support for the belief we should be good and kind so we can get to heaven by quoting another non-believer: Sigmund Freud. He said, \"When I ask myself why I have always behaved honorably, ready to spare others and to be kind whenever possible, and when I did not give up being so when I observed that in that way one harms oneself and becomes an anvil because other people are brutal and untrustworthy, then it is true, I have no answer.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The penultimate Anglo-Saxon epic</td><td>4.0</td><td>[note: this is a review of the poem generally, not this particular translation] Beowulf is one of those Medieval works of literature that many have heard about but few have read.

It's an odd mix of early Christian and warrior ethos. Beowulf is not a modern hero. There's not much to recommend him to modern readers - he's boastful, relies on brawn not brains, and his search for glory ends up putting his kingdom at risk. Still, it's fascinating to read this type of story and realize how far away it is from our own times. Because this is a translation of an Anglo-Saxon poem, it's worth saying a word about the text itself. It's readable, but isn't smooth reading for the uninitiated. I'd say this - if you don't like reading English-language poetry, you probably won't enjoy reading this poem. If you do make the effort, I'd recommend really making the effort.

That is certainly true of Rosa Parks (February 4, 1913 - October 24, 2005). As is true of the other volumes in this series, this mini-biography is based on rock-solid historical material and includes a number of archival photos to supplement the lively narrative created by the Time editors in collaboration with Karen Kellaher. I feel obligated to add, that this is not a book written for younger \"dummies\" or \"idiots.\" It ought to be in all school and public libraries and would be an excellent birthday or holiday gift for children, one that parents, grandparents, and other relatives should consider. To this day, a false but remarkably durable misunderstanding suggests that, on December 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks \"stepped onto a bus - and into history,\" she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, she did so only because she was tired after another long and wearying day of work as a seamstress in a department store in Montgomery, Alabama. \"People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true.... No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.\" \"Rosa hated segregation, and she hoped that the laws would change one day. But she did not know that her own act of courage would lead the way,\" as indeed it did. In this volume, we learn about her childhood and life on a farm, her experiences in a culture that was separate but hardly equal, her \"act of courage,\" the bus boycott that followed, her active involvement in the civil rights movement, her friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr., and her various activities in later years such as the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development until declining health prevented her from traveling, participating in freedom marches, and delivering speeches. In 1996, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and, three years later, the Congressional Gold Medal. She died at the age of ninety-two. According to Congressman John Conyers for whom she worked in his Detroit office for many years, \"Rosa Parks showed us that everybody counts. When we all decide to do something, it amounts to a wave of energy that can indeed change things. She taught us that nobody should be held back because of their skin color. Each individual is important and powerful. That was her gift to us.\" And that will continue to be her gift to generations to come.

The story is supposed to be an exploration of American mythsa story in which the old gods of America and the new gods of America go to war with each other. The novel fails on a number of counts. The novel doesn't really have much to do with American gods at all. The book is mostly about some washed up Norse gods with a smattering of Egyptian and Russian gods thrown in. This could have potentially worked as a book idea, but the way in which Gaiman frames his story is most unsatisfying. Immigrants bring their gods with them to America in this book, but there weren't any immigrants bringing over these gods. He tries to make some excuse for this, but it's thin. I mean reallyAnubis is an undertaker in the midwest? Anubis is an American god? It's so lame. He doesn't use much that's authentically American in the story. The gods of Greece and Rome would be one step closer to Americana than Odin and Thoth, but he doesn't mention them. Christianity barely makes an appearance in this book. I suppose I'm thankful for that since Gaiman probably would have botched it and the book would have been even worse. Even so, it's curious that a book about American gods hardly recognizes America's most popular religion. America is much more religious than most other developed countries. The fact that the book didn't grapple with this fact makes it a poorer book. Gaiman keeps saying that America is a hard place for gods. That just goes to show that Gaiman doesn't understand America. Faith in America is much stronger than it is where Gaiman comes from. Besides the fact that the book was a mess thematically, it's a mess structurally too. It's long. It's tedious. Characters come and go with no real importance or impact on the narrative. The main character doesn't seem to have much depth, but then all the sudden he's talking like Socrates, but then he goes back to lameness. There's no consistency. Some scenes are interesting and entertaining, while others are filled with clunky prose. The book would have been much stronger if his editor would have forced him to cut it down by about half. Actually, I read the tenth-anniversary edition in which Gaiman adds in twelve thousand words that his editors cut from the original. I should have realized that this was going to be a mistake. After reading it, I've decided that he should have trusted his editor. Actually if his editor was doing his job he would have cut an additional thirty thousand words. The worst bits are when Gaiman intersperses the chapters with \"interludes\" which explain how various gods came to America. These interludes are so boring. The thematic failings wouldn't have hurt the book so much if it had been shorter and less serious. Instead the book aspires to some kind of epic meditation on the soul of America and it buckles under it's own pretensions. Not recommended.

The author is uniquely qualified for this task and explains the processes and reasons for the processes of what he calls Verbal Judo with wonderful stories and analogies that illustrate his points, having apparently, spent the better part of his early life verbally reacting to situations with all the predictable negative outcomes that he intersperses so eloquently in the text.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Strange and Strangely Unbalanced</td><td>2.0</td><td>Gaiman summed up my feeling while reading the novel pretty well in this quote from the book: \"All things have rules.\" \"Yeah,\" said Shadow. \"But nobody tells me what they are. You keep talking about the rules, I don't even know what game you people are playing.\" The fact of the matter is that there are no rules in this story. It felt to me a little like \"Lost\"  I kept asking myself, where's this long, winding story going? Ultimately, I think the answer is simply wherever Gaiman felt like taking it at the moment he was writing a particular scene. I thought I would like this novel because I'm a fan of mythology. I was fascinated long ago by Joseph Campbell's writing on myth, and I hoped that American Gods would do justice to the magic and mystery of traditional mythology, and that Gaiman would channel the gods of old to enrich a modern novel... not so much. It felt to me more like Gaiman was polluting old, beloved myths with modern grit and crass. And it just made no sense. Why so many obscure gods, when ones that are still commonly worshiped are nowhere to be found? Why so many gruesome myths? Where are the beautiful myths, and where is the beautiful side of mythology? There is only one notable exception, and of course it has to do with a beautiful woman. Why so many sub-stories that have nothing to do with the plot? Why doesn't the main character ask more questions early on? I think a good example of Gaiman's bias toward the darker, dirtier side of myth is in his depiction of Hindu deities: The only major role is given to Kali, a relatively obscure deity. Durga, her purer counterpart, isn't mentioned. The major deities, like Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva are nowhere to be found. Ganesh, so popularly worshipped that you'll see his likeness in hotels and restaurants across America, has a bit part. There is a bizarre allusion to Jesus Christ that was odd in that it didn't seem well developed and just didn't need to be there, except perhaps so that Gaiman could claim one more religious/mythical reference. All that being said, Gaiman writes extremely well. He writes so well that you really want the story to deliver. He imbibes depth and complexity into his storytelling. He understands the function of myth, and he writes with that understanding in mind. The plot also does have some clever twists to it. The last quarter of the book was much easier for me to read than the first three quarters. My recommendation: If you're interested in Neil Gaiman, try Anansi Boys, which is similar but more light-hearted and less ambitious (and that felt appropriate to me), or Good Omens (co-written with Terry Pratchett). Oh, one little nitpick: The Hindu goddess is a motherly figure that asks that people call her Mama-ji. Uh... that means \"Uncle on your mother's side\" in Hindi. It's repeated several times, and each time I wondered why Gaiman hadn't bothered to google the phrase when he was writing...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Boring</td><td>1.0</td><td>Expected way more than this book delivered.

Thus began a relationship between Finkel and the man who stole his identity, Chris Longo. While Longo awaits trial for the murders of his wife and three small children, Finkel visits Longo in prison and the two begin exchanging letters. Slowly a portrait of a psychopath emerges. Longo has only a high school education and no skills, but he has a family to support. He cant stand the thought of failure. So, he invents success through lies and deceit. He writes bad checks because he needs money for his family and his failing business. He steals an SUV because his wife always wanted one and he wants to be seen as a good provider. Finkel tells Longos story while at the same time reflecting on his own indiscretions and the mistake that cost him his job. Heres how Finkel sums up Longos story. My year with Longo made me see how a persons life could spiral out of control; how one could get lost in a haze of dishonesty, and how these things could have dire consequences. Throughout the book Finkel leaves Longos guilt or innocence in question. This part memoir, part portrait of a psychopath, is also a murder mystery. You want to know hat happened and why. As it turns out, Longo gives three different versions of what happened to his family. And since Longo is the only one who knows the truth, you're left to decide on your own which version is correct.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Slow-paced and a bit predictable</td><td>3.0</td><td>Walter Dean Myers is a master of YA literature, but with this one, you get the feeling that he's riding his reputation instead of putting something really solid out there.

But Candice Hern succeeded admirably here, I thought. A word of warning however, if you're more in the mood for a romance novel that fairly reeks of sexual tension and passion, you might want to give \"Once a Gentleman\" a miss. If on the other hand you're in the mood for a book about a couple that are compelled to marry, where the heroine is in love with the hero, but where it takes the man a while to fully appreciate and fall in love with his admirable wife, that is written in a more restrained vein, then you definitely will enjoy \"Once a Gentleman.\" Nicholas Parrish as always seen Prudence Armitage as a mousy but intelligent friend -- the good sort, but definitely not the type he would ever consider marrying. And yet, because he unintentionally ends up compromising her, that is exactly what happens. Now newly married man Nicholas Parrish has to consider the best way to go about making his marriage to shy and demure Prudence work. To start with, he'll be the very picture of a patient husband and not press her for marital intimacies until she's ready. What Nicholas didn't know, however, was that Prudence has been in love with him for quite a while now, and that she is more than willing to be \"true\" wife to him. But Prudence also realizes that she's not the type of wife Nicholas would have chosen for himself if he had had the choice. Will Nicholas and Prudence be able to make their marriage work? Or will continue to blunder about in misconception and misapprehension forever? I think what I liked most about \"Once a Gentleman\" was that both the hero and heroine are nice, likable people -- it's nice to read a romance novel where you like both the main characters and where you don't spend a lot of time wanting to brain either. Another thing I really liked was that the authour didn't take the path of turning her heroine into a sudden supermodel with a few snips of the hair and a new wardrobe. Yes, Prudence does get a new hairstyle and more attractive clothes, but she suddenly doesn't become the Season's latest sensation with hordes of Regency bucks panting after her, thus making the novel another one of those where the hero learns to appreciate his wife via jealousy. Prudence remains the shy, reserved young lady that charmed me from the very beginning. And this allowed for the authour to add a little humour to the bits where Prudence tries to flirt with Nicholas only to have things go terribly wrong. It also made things seem terribly realistic. If you know nothing about flirting, and are not used to it, to suddenly acquire the prowess of a siren seems rather unrealistic, and yet you always see this in most books! Also nicely done was the gradual manner in which Nicholas grows to love and appreciate his wife (and to learn to be a little less proud and self absorbed). Nicholas has a lot of less admirable traits to get rid off, and the authour shows him coming to grips with his less admirable side in a very believable manner. \"Once a Gentleman\" doesn't have a very complicated plot. Rather, it focuses completely on the relationship between a husband and wife. It is a somewhat quiet read, but a rather romantic one at that.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Enjoyable but could have been more concise</td><td>4.0</td><td>I am a frequent Sierra visitor so many of the locations mentioned are places I have been or camped -- that's my disclaimer!

It would have been the perfect length for a New Yorker feature for example. Certain elements of the story get repeated so many times as to encourage section skipping, something I normally don't do in a book I like. There are a couple of things in the book that rang a little odd to me. Referring to Randy's travels to Bangkok as \"exploring\" the religion of \"hedonism\" is hopefully intended as humor, and there are other places where the writer glosses over what seem to be major lapses in relationship judgement. Ditto for Randy's female friend in the mountains, who escapes with barely a scratch despite some pretty questionable tactics. I also did not really grasp the picture painted of Alden Nash, who seems to graduate from passive, annoyed observer to active participant only after the mystery has been solved. Maybe the writer had to steer around some complex politics in writing this book given that so many of the participants are still alive and even contributed to his work. If the book's aim was to show what an incredible ranger and asset to our parks Randy was, then it succeeded completely. He seemed to be the absolute ideal ranger. Indeed I would have liked to have seen him move more into oversight and politics as he got older, as his thoughts on managing parks and visitors aligned very closely with my own.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>I lost sleep...</td><td>5.0</td><td>If, like me, you are a bedtime reader, plan to lose some sleep with this book.....you'll just have to keep reading, needing to know the whole bizarre story...and the author tells it expertly.

I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish it.  It is a true crime story written in a clear, elegant style.  Every sentence is polished, and every sentence is planned and placed in exactly the right place.  There is no obvious striving for effect, no lurid prose, no fancy writing.  Michael Finkel employs what George Orwell once called the invisible style.  The writing is so unobtrusive, so deliberate in not calling attention to itself that what the reader experiences is the story itself, pure and simple. Or stories.  The book is like a film or a commercial novel in that there is a main plot and a subplot.  The main plot is the story of Christian Longo who murdered his wife and three children and then ran to Mexico where he pretended to be Michael Finkel, ace reporter for the New York Times.  This was a startling coincidence because Finkel had just been fired from the Times for falsifying a story about cocoa plantation \"slaves\" in West Africa.  He was disgraced and fallen from the pinnacle of journalistic prestige.  That is the subplot.  Both stories are interwoven together in a masterful way.  And the sequence of events is presented in a dramatic--not a strictly chronological--way so that the tension is maintained and the reader is led to eagerly turn the pages. The overall story began when Finkel found out about Chris Longo impersonating him.  Struck with the coincidence, he felt compelled to know more about Longo and why the accused murderer took on his name.  He contacted Longo and worked hard to establish rapport and a friendship.  His motive was to get as much information from Longo as he could in order to write a book.  The book would fuse the story of his disgrace with that of a man who had murdered his family.  The thread that ties the stories together is not just the initial coincidence but an obsession with honesty that haunted both men and the obvious lack of honesty that they both practiced.  Both Finkel and Longo strove again and again to come completely clean about what they had done and what they were doing while using each other under the guise of friendship.  Longo used Finkel as somebody to talk to (he had been isolated from the other prisoners and had almost no contact with anyone other than his lawyers) and as a sounding board for his defensive strategy.  Finkel used Longo as a source for a story that would restart his career.  As Finkel makes vivid, both men were more than a little desperate. At one point Finkel gives part of the voluminous correspondence he had with Longo to three shrinks.  They conclude that Longo has a narcissistic personality.  He may indeed be narcissistic, but more to the point, Longo is a psychopath.  He has all the classic features: a charming personality; a behavioral record of lies and thefts and murders; a grotesque sense of ultimately caring about nobody but himself; and finally an ability to be completely without remorse and able to party after his crimes, as he did in Mexico. Ironically, I think it is Finkel who has at least a touch of the narcissistic personality.  We can see this in his tendency toward an exaggerated sense of his own importance, first in imagining that the world would be all that interested in his story (ah, but he made the world interested by his skillful writing) and in this from page 267 (he's talking to Longo's lawyers who want ideas for Longo's defense): He writes, \"I felt, at that moment, as though Longo's life was in my hands--that if I said the right thing, he'd be spared the death penalty.\"  We can also see this in the tremendous amount of energy Finkel put into researching and writing this book.  He desperately wanted to regain his reputation and to be regarded again as a top flight journalist. Both men are caught in a moral confusion about lies and honesty, Longo because he's a psychopath who doesn't understand how people can be so upset about lying since it would seen to be the natural thing to do if it might benefit you (sociopaths learn at an early age that they are supposed to be remorseful about lying, and that it's bad, but they never really appreciate why, and so they are fascinated with the dynamics); Finkel because as he freely admits has told many lies in his life including the lies that ended his career at the New York Times.  Neither has apparently thought much about Emerson's \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\"  Neither seems to understand that it is not so much the absolute consistency of what you say as it is your motive for what you say and especially how what you say affects others.  That is what counts.  Most people know this.  Furthermore everybody lies at one time or another, but not when bearing witness and not when the lives of other people might be adversely affected. I think what fascinated Finkel about Longo was that he could see in him a caricature of himself; and as long as he could imagine that Longo might not be guilty or as long as he didn't look too closely at the murders, that was tolerable.  However after sitting through the trial and hearing Longo's grotesque self-serving lies about the murders and the horrific details, Finkel had to psychologically distance himself from his would-be, partial alter-ego.  And rightly so since there is something terribly unsettling about their symbiotic relationship. But in the final analysis I say good for Michael Finkel.  This is an outstanding work, a fine addition to a genre I like to call \"participatory journalism.\"  What Finkel learned about himself from this chancy venture is possibly as important as what this book has done for his career and for his self-esteem.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Too many artificial and processed foods - a review of diet vs. health</td><td>2.0</td><td>A few years ago I tried this diet and was extremely successful. I achieved my goal at the time: to lose weight. But over the years I've slowly put the weight back on, so I pulled this book back off the shelf, dusted it off, and thought I'd try it again. Well, I was so shocked by what I saw in the recipes that I felt compelled to write a review. Let me be clear - as a weight loss plan, this worked. Combined with rigorous exercise, I lost about 20 pounds. I followed it to the letter. My copy of the book still has my original sticky notes & flags all over the place. I remember it being EXTREMELY rough at first, but that's because I'm hypoglycemic. At the time my blood sugar was so out of whack that Phase I initially sent me into full-blown insulin shock. I had headaches & severe dizzy spells, so I had to adjust it a little (added fruit & was careful with workouts), but I remember that after a week or so things leveled out and I felt better. I stuck with the \"diet\" until I achieved my goal weight, then stuck with it a while longer, then gradually fell away from it (and the weight crept back on). So I thought I'd try it again. HOWEVER - when I opened up my trusty \"diet\" book (because I remembered South Beach very fondly), I was SHOCKED at the actual recipes. This diet makes extensive use of artificial sweeteners and processed foods. And I really do mean extensive. Everything is fat-free this, sugar-free that. Every \"substitute\" you can think of (liquid eggs, margarine, processed lunch meats, etc.). It's like the author made a list of real, whole foods, and then made a \"cheat sheet\" - a list of every fake version of real food that he could find. I looked at this with new eyes and realized that of course I lost weight - I was eating fake food. I didn't change anything about my life with this diet - I just \"cheated\" until I was thin again. In the years in between the first time I used this diet and now, I've done a LOT of reading about nutrition, diets, and our food industry. Specifically, how our food is grown and processed. I guess my perspective has changed, and this time I don't just want to lose the 15 pounds I've put back on. This time I want to be HEALTHY. I want to eat food that is good for my body. It isn't just about getting thin. It's about avoiding cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and all the other diseases that scare me. Now I'm seeing this diet with new eyes, and I'm horrified and a little nauseated by the thought of how many chemicals and artificial ingredients I was pouring into my body. Did I lose weight? Absolutely. But at the time I didn't stop to think about whether or not this diet was actually HEALTHY or GOOD for my body. I didn't think about the nitrates in all that turkey bacon & lunchmeat I was eating. Or what happens to food when they take out the fat and the sugar (and what they put back IN). Anyway - I'm writing this review for people who may not realize that this diet relies extensively on artificial and processed foods. I'm NOT knocking anyone who uses this diet or even saying it doesn't work. We all know that saying \"just eat in moderation and exercise, and you will lose weight\" doesn't work or we'd all be thin. Most of us don't have the will power to give up all the stuff we KNOW is bad and stick to salads (myself included). But \"dieting\" and \"getting healthy\" are two totally different things, and I think people should know that this is a DIET, not a health plan (like the author claims). This is about finding \"cheat\" foods so you don't feel deprived of the junk you usually eat. It's just my opinion that those \"cheat\" foods aren't any healthier, nutritionally speaking, than the junk food. Personally, I didn't learn anything from this diet. Obviously it didn't have a lasting impact, because I didn't stick with it (even though I meant to). You know that saying 'cheaters never win' - that pretty much sums up how I feel about this diet. Get this one from the library BEFORE you buy it. Maybe the things that bother me won't bother you. But you should know what you're getting, and you should read a few other books about nutrition, before spending your hard earned money on this book. Personally, I'm going to look elsewhere for an eating plan that puts *real* food first.

Alastair Reid wrote, \"What is true lies between you and the idea of you -- a friciton, restless, between the fact and the fiction\" in his book WHERE TRUTH LIES.  We can all take what we want to believe and make it 'truth' as we see it.  It may be a fantasy or, as in this case, a coverup for something bad. Sometime in 2001, the Longo family (wife and three children) are found murdered; the father, Christian, is captured in Mexico using the alias of Micahel Finkel of the 'New York Times.'  The real M. F. is indeed a writer for the 'Times magazine.'  After the capture of the 'false' M. F., the real one is fired for \"falsifying part of an investigative article.\" He now has the time to dig and discover why this particular individual wanted to be him.  The two men exchange nearly 1,000 letters, talk on the phone about his upcoming trial, and talk face-to-face in the prison visiting area.  He becomes emotionally involved in the case and sets out to prove the innocence of his new friend (in a slightly unusual way).  It seems that Longo had lived a life of deception and lies, and the truth is never as he tries to make it. This reads more like a novel with the two protaganists on the same side of the law, and yet at times, they are disbelieving of each other and the reasons they are communicating.  Of course, the journalist gets a book out of the process.  But what does the theif of his identity receive as a consequence.  The author lives in Bozeman, Montana.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>A good story, poorly written</td><td>2.0</td><td>Author Eric Blehm clearly cares about the American wilderness and the people, like Randy Morgenson, who take responsibility for and at times succumb to its harsh beauty, but he's not very good at telling the reader about any of that. At one point, he quotes Wallace Stegner, who provided a harsh (but honest) critique to Morgenson himself, when Morgenson tried his own hand at writing, saying, \"It's all about your feelings and sensations, and those don't communicate well to a reader. He half feels you indulging a sort of yeasty nature mysticism....\" That's Blehm. The young Morgenson is a \"dashing young ranger,\" \"with ... expressive, gentle eyes that held a hint of something she couldn't put her finger on. Mystery, perhaps.\" Duh. Typical of Blehm's narrative is a \"description\" of an incident when Morgenson and a fellow ranger were called upon to handle a plane crash in the back country. The anecdote should be rich with detail. Instead, all we get is, \"A plane had crashed, it was windy, snow squalls were settling in over the higher peaks, and ... the helicopter took off with their packs still inside. ...They had no survival gear. Fortunately, the helicopter was able to make it back through the clouds to pick them up after the operation.\" And that's it. No specifics. No details. We get the occasional quote from Morgenson's logs (e.g., \"I yearned to know the plants, geology, glaciology, weather, and the effects of these things on each other\") but unlike Morgenson, who supposedly gave \"two pages\" in his logbooks to \"the song of the hermit thrush,\" Blehm offers only generalities. After wading through several hundred pages of Blehm's starry-eyed blather, I came away thoroughly disgusted with the late Mr. Morgenson. He appears to have been a selfish aging hippie who, having cheated on his wife and been served with divorce papers, walked off into the mountains, leaving his colleagues with the job of a heartbreaking and ultimately fruitless search-and-rescue mission. (His remains were found by a California Conservation Corps trailbuilding group about five years after his disappearance, near a gorge \"where grasses and mountain flowers made a living in patches of silt and rocky soil.\" Again, no details.) Blehm could have used a few classes in botany, geology, glaciology, weather, and the effects of these things on each other and on the human beings who love and work in the American wilderness. It's a pity he preferred to indulge himself in yeasty nature mysticism, instead.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>EXCELLENT</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is an excellent book on two fronts: one, the author's mea culpa...... and two, a true crime story.  I had already read most of the details of the Christian Longo murders in Carlton Smith's book, but it was no problem reading them again because the crimes were so dastardly and this book so well written.  I also was curious about the author's so called crime of inventing parts of a piece he wrote for the New York Times. So, after reading the author's account of his \"crime\" (which alternates in this book with Long's horrific crimes), plus the account of the NY Times and others, I do not see evidence of a crime of any sort.  For all those writers (journalists) who think they are being totally truthful and tell the truth and nothing but the truth, have they forgotten that \"there is nothing new under the sun\" (Ecclesiastes 1:19) and that therefore all writing is in some way pilfered from other sources.  For Finkel, who is a fine writer, to have been fired for what he did is as ridiculous as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's name being smeared in a hateful manner for doing something similar.  How on earth can a story be told, any story, without using something that is not entirely new?  There are only so many ways the scant letters of our alphabet can be arranged. That being said, this is a very readable book and I wish the best to the author and hope to read more of his works soon.  Hopefully, the shunning of Finkel, Goodwin and others will soon halt in the face of common sense.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Incredibly unfamiliar but highly intellectual</td><td>4.0</td><td>All of the poems in this book were written in some other language.  Robert Bly has attempted to arrange the poets in the order in which he discovered them.  The index only lists poems, not important people, but Bly's comments include incredible intellectual connections to this work, such as, \"Ludwig Wittgenstein knew that Trakl was a genius, and he set aside money for Trakl through a patron,\"  (p. 138).  I consider Wittgenstein important in this book because the relationship between philosophy and silence is expressed so well in the final verse of the poem \"The Twelve Lies\" by Rumi (1204-1273): So just keep silent, and if anyone says to you, \"No communion takes place without words,\" just say to him, \"I heard that lie.\"  (p. 347). There are 14 poems by Rumi in this book, in the first of which: The kind of love we know of is too great for sober reason  (p. 334). The basic problem of philosophy is stated well in the fifth verse of \"The Twelve Lies\"  : Daydreamers with sluggish eyes say, \"Your poems and your teaching stories are nothing but daydreams.\" I heard that lie.  (p. 346). David Koresh, who was briefly famous before he died near Waco, Texas on April 19, 1993, had an exalted image of himself as a prophet much like the seventh verse : They say, \"The keeper of secrets never tells A single secret except to an intermediary.\" People love that lie.  (p. 346). The first verse might be considered a poetic attempt to state a joke that could be fundamental to the nature of my own unfinished project, MY VIETNAM WAR JOKE BOOK: People say, \"The one you love is unfaithful.\" That's the first lie.  (p. 346). At its worst, poetry can suggest words randomly put together in a way that might mean something in another language, but which we read with an apprehensiveness that makes us feel like a line in this book: The immense treeless plains of the human brain have gotten folded and refolded  'til they are the size of a fist.

Randy Morgenson is a thoroughly interesting subject, complete with human frailties, but the allure of this book is in the details of both his life and death.  The author treats us to little interesting tidbits throughout, such as the fact that Randy learned about photography from the iconic Ansel Adams. The author obviously took painstaking steps to exhaustively research the story, and the care he took is evidenced throughout.  The man and the history is compelling, but it is the superb writing that takes you on the journey where you can picture every event as it unfolds, through the lost art of true storytelling. I especially enjoyed reading at the end, that the rangers had \"unofficially\" named an unnamed peak after Randy Morgenson.  Although officially denied this honor, Randy can look down from that great mountain range in the sky, and note that at least Google Maps recognizes it! There was only one thing that disappointed me - evidently, the Kindle version does not contain the photos that are included in the book, nor has it been updated to the latest paperback release version.

Blehm gets into Morgenson's head in a way that perhaps, Morgenson could not get into his own head. \"The Last Season\" is the saga of the often humdrum duties of a backcountry ranger, combined with a psychological study of Ranger Morgenson that makes this a compelling, memorable read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Excellent</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is one of the best eating plan I have found, it's very healthy plus very tasty and satisfying.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Paul Schmitt</td><td>5.0</td><td>What a fantastic book!

This one was just plain boring and juvenile.  So many of the things that happened had me thinking: \"Huh?\"  Why would they do that?  It honestly read like it was written by a high-school student for a junior-high audience.  Sorry.  I know that's mean.  I just couldn't \"get\" why people were doing the things they were.

However, it is useful to note that originality is not always necessary to enjoyment. What's pleasant here are relatively pleasant characters engaged in a good plot. There are annoyances. Some important elements (such as the thieves extensive underground network of tunnels) are strictly plot devices. And the good/evil division is too pat.

It is complex, filled with mysteries, intrigue, adventure, excitement and elements of epic tales like being true to oneself and loyalty to friend and cause.  Definitely read this series!

Being an avid reader of fantasy, I was especially glad to see a good plot develop through this trilogy as well.  It's been a long time since a new work came out that had all the major elements(plot, character, background and dialogue) nailed down in a well written fashion. This series would be just about perfect if the there was a pronunciation guide for the character names.  Sonea and Ceryni, two of the first characters you get to meet have names that could be pronounced any number of ways.  It's a real drag to find out after several years that you've been pronouncing your favorite character's name incorrectly.  Might be easier if I were Australian(like the author). That aside, Kyralia and Imardin are wonderfully deep in detail.  After you've read the books through once, you almost don't need the maps that are provided.  The characters, while stronger than most of the others, are not perfect or constantly rescued in some improbable or unimaginable way.  Lastly, the magic system isn't overly hard to grasp.  This makes it easier to get lost in the story without getting bogged down in the mechanics like so many other books lately. I highly recommend this book and the rest of the trilogy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>tales of loneliness and death</td><td>4.0</td><td>I loved it!

When a book can do that it deserves the highest rating there is to give (and from a first time novelist no less!) How do we forgive the unforgivable?  That is the question that is at the crux of this well etched novel.  This is a novel about women on death row, but just to say that would be selling this book incredibly too short.  The story centers around three women: Celia, Franny, and Karen. Their lives become inextricably entertwined during a few short months in the hot Texas summer.  All three have dealt with copious amounts of sadness throughout their lives and in the end have managed to work through it with tremendous grace. This is a compelling read, very vivid, poetic.  Ms. Eyre-Ward's style and her characters are memorable, no nonsense and very very real. I look forward to more by this author!!

This work is, and reads like, a first-time novel for a debuting author. Canavan has restricted herself to staying within the generally accepted and widely used boundaries of fantasy work: medievalism, magicians and thieves. The story is a coming-of-age of Sonea, a slum girl who accidentally unleashes her magical powers when she and a group of friends try to obstruct the work of the Magician's Guild who are purging all the poor from the city. They throw rocks that bounce off the invisible barrier held up by the magicians. Except that Sonea's rock gets through when she wills it to, and strikes the temple of Lord Fergun. Mass confusion ensues among the magicians, and they end up accidentally killing a boy standing near Sonea. Sonea herself is confused by what's happened to her. She runs and hides from the magicians who have identified her magical potential. The problem is, the longer she hides, the less controllable her magic becomes and the more destruction she creates to those around her. Even the Thieves are unable to protect her. Inevitably, Sonea ends up at the Magician's Guild. The book tells the tale of how Sonea ends up at the Guild, and her apprenticeship. The plot focuses around the High Lord (the one that rules the Guild), whom Sonea accidentally observes practicing black magic. She and a few others who know about this, lie in wait but know that eventually they must do something about the High Lord. Meanwhile, Sonea is often troubled by Regis, a school bully, since she is the only slum girl in a school full of upper class students. The details of Sonea's tough existence, frankly, are boring. This book comes in two parts, but in my opinion, they needed to be edited down to a quarter of a book. Books two and three could have formed the rest of the book. As one piece, the work would have been snazzy, snappy and sweet. As a trilogy, it is drawn out and somewhat stilted, suffering from too much information of banal aspects of the characters' lives that are of no interest to the reader. However, it does have its merits. This book might interest some younger readers or those whose interest in fantasy are exclusively to magic. Once into the story, it becomes easier to ignore the glaring rawness of the writing. Happily, Canavan obviously becomes more comfortable with her characters, and the second and third book flow more easily than this one, although trite details still poke through excessively. The story, nevertheless, becomes more interesting, and because of this, it deserves three starts.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Strange and disjointed.</td><td>1.0</td><td>Felt like a waste of my money.

This is the best Rollins book yet and it is sure to please. Sandstorm begins in England, and after a mysterious murder, an artifact is found inside an ancient statute.  It leads to a race in the desert between two groups searching for the lost city of UBAR.

The writing takes you into the desert and you can feel the Sandstorm heading towards you.  If you are looking to be transported away for a fun filled journey, this is the book for you! Along the way there are the normal twists and turns that keep you wanting more.  Some in the past have said there was not enough character development in Rollins' books, but this time, I think there is just enough.  You get to know what is driving the characters and can see why they are doing the things that they are. This is a great book for that summer weekend at the beach or just sitting out on your front porch!

My daughter is five-and-a-half and will start kindergarten this fall, and we both felt that these books were a step up from other level one books, for example the Step Into Reading series. Though she was able to read this book independently, I just feel parents should be aware that this book has some advanced vocabulary and complex sentence structure which beginning readers might have some difficulty with, e.g.: \"I'm happy that we have good weather for our family get-together!\" \"We've done our best to prepare to welcome the family to our lair.\" \"Look! Twin Cousins Mike and Ike are riding their two-seater bike.\" The books in the series have engaging story lines and each page has beautiful full-color illustrations.

I believe Gaiman is a talented writer.  The first part really drew me in, mainly due to Gaimans writing skill.  Shadows time in prison and his release were intensely interesting.  Then things started falling apart for me. Im not a fan of dream sequences or other hallucinogenic/semi-reality scenes, and there were TONS in this book. Im not a fan of things that would give a movie an R rating, and there were TONS in this book. Im not a fan of long descriptions, and there were TONS in this book. And, for heavens sake, I know theres a war coming.  You don't have to tell me five hundred times. I AM a fan of the overall concept:  immigrants bringing gods with them, the gods losing power as faith wanes, etc.  I found some of the god characters really interesting, and some of the back stories fascinating.  However, I felt that the book wandered too much to really execute the premise well. Terry Pratchett brilliantly addressed this general theme in Small Gods, and did it with charm and humor and a PG rating.  If you weren't quite satisfied with American Gods, try Pratchetts take. Back to American Gods: I enjoyed some of the endless parade of quirky characters that often just disappeared after their scenes.  They were interesting, and it wasn't a problem that they disappeared.  It was when they re-appeared 400 pages later, and I couldn't remember how they fit in, that it became a problem. I think my favorite parts, besides the first, were the times spent in small-town Lakeside.  I absolutely loved the stories Hinzelman told.  Gaiman certainly has an imagination.  Of course, Hinzelmans later plot seemed a little out of place.  Still, I liked that whole part of the book, and found myself wishing it took up a larger percentage of the novel. Anyway, I think Gaiman is talented, and he brought up some really interesting concepts.  I even highlighted some fantastic passages.  Heres one: Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father.even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrive, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition. The book in its entirety just wasn't to my taste, and could have benefited from some more ruthless editing. Warning:  Explicit (and unnecessary) sex scenes and references.

Brutal violence.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Many unanswered questions, but this is indeed the end. . . .</td><td>4.0</td><td>\"This book is the last in A Series of Unfortunate Events, and even if you braved the previous twelve volumes, you probably can't stand such unpleasantries as a fearsome storm, a suspicious beverage, a herd of wild sheep, an enormous bird cage, and a truly haunting secret about the Baudelaire parents.\" A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS number thirteen is the last in this series, as would be imagined by the title. In this one, the Baudelaire orphans pick up where they left off in The Penultimate Peril: In the same boat as their enemy Count Olaf in more ways than one. Basic outline of the book and plot spoilers ahead. The book begins with the Baudelaires and Count Olaf in a boat together. Olaf orders the Baudelaires around and clutches a harpoon gun and a helmet full of poisonous fungus. The Baudelaires wonder whether to push Olaf overboard as he leans over the side of the boat to pull off the \"Carmelita\" label to reveal a \"Count Olaf\" label. A storm hits. The boat washes up on a coastal shelf. Everyone has survived, and Olaf continues to order the orphans around as they walk around the shelf. A young girl named Friday greets them, and since the Baudelaires are polite, they are invited to the island which is her home, but since Olaf keeps claiming to be their king and threatens Friday with the harpoon gun, she tells him to go away. The orphans get led to the island and are offered coconut cordial, which tastes strange and sweet. They meet Ishmael, the island's facilitator, and then they are told to put on white robes like everyone else and give away all their possessions. Klaus is allowed to keep his glasses, but otherwise they have to hide what they're each keeping: Violet hides her ribbon, Klaus hides his commonplace book, and Sunny hides her egg whisk. The islanders go through the usual custom of sorting through anything that had washed up on the beach during the storm. Ishmael rejects just about everything except nets and blankets, and has some sheep drag the items away. During this, many islanders are named, and they all have one thing in common: Their names have been used in some story or myth about the sea or islands. After that, the orphans are given food they don't like and their own seashell canteens full of coconut cordial, and the islanders drink a toast to the children. But Ishmael refers to them as orphans even though they haven't told him their story . . . which makes them very suspicious about how much this man knows. The Baudelaires find their places on the island: Violet helps with the laundry, Klaus helps pile clay on Ishmael's ailing feet and refills his cordial canteen, and Sunny helps with the cooking. They discuss their past and what they miss, and decide they both like and dislike living on the island. Their peace comes to an end when a weird craft made out of strapped-together books arrives, carrying Kit Snicket . . . and Count Olaf, who is disguised as usual. Olaf, in a seaweed wig pretending to be the pregnant Kit Snicket, tries to fool the islanders, but unlike every other time in the books, every single person sees through his disguise. They decide to put him in a cage that washed up in the last storm, and they abandon him with the books he rode in on and Kit Snicket. But because Olaf announced that Sunny was hiding a whisk in her robe, Ishmael found out what each of them hid, and decided to abandon THEM as well. Abandoned, the kids sit with only a snake (the Incredibly Deadly Viper from book 2), an unconscious friend, and Count Olaf to keep them company. They discover that Ishmael had been eating apples (as evidenced by an apple core that fell out of his robe), and thus realize he's being selfish and untruthful about his feet being hurt. Olaf offers to share a plan and information if they will let him out of the cage, but they go out of his sight and think about their choices. Olaf falls asleep and the Baudelaires keep thinking. Soon enough, Kit Snicket wakes up and is happy to see them (and their snake), but is disappointed to hear that Dewey is not with them. (The Baudelaires decide not to tell her that he was harpooned in the last book.) Two islanders--Finn and Erewhon--approach the orphans and bring them all onion soup, and they reveal that they are tired of Ishmael and are planning a mutiny--a schism. The Baudelaires are talked into helping invent and build weapons for this mutiny in return for promised help for the injured, pregnant, and distraught Kit. The Baudelaires arrive at the arboretum where all the rejected items end up, and they quickly fall in love with the place. Their snake shows them a secret passageway under the roots of a tree, and there they discover an odd room. The siblings reclaim their lost items and discover new ones, and discuss using peer pressure instead of weapons to get rid of Ishmael. Then they discover a diary-like history of the island, and just as they realize it mentions Kit Snicket and contains some of their mother's handwriting, Ishmael arrives. Ishmael claims he knew the Baudelaires would come to this place because it was \"in their blood\" to do so--he knew their parents, and revealed that they had lived on the island once too. But they had been forced to leave, and Ishmael claims that the children were never told the sad history of their parents because the parents didn't want them to know; they'd wanted them to be shielded from the unfortunate events of the world instead of adding their own chapter to the book. Ishmael wants them to abandon their lives and live simply according to the island's rules, because it's what their parents would have wanted. The island sheep drag Ishmael and the Baudelaires back to the island, where a mutiny is already in progress. Ishmael supporters are fighting with people who want to overthrow him. Everyone starts voicing their suggestions, and then Count Olaf--still wearing a dress with a false pregnancy--wanders in and challenges Ishmael, at which point it is revealed that Ishmael was part of V.F.D. as well and has a secret history with Olaf. In order to end things once and for all, Ishmael fires the harpoon gun at Olaf's belly . . . where he is hiding a helmet full of poisonous fungus. Everyone, including Olaf, is exposed to the poison. Ishmael expects everyone to sip coconut cordial and think about their situation, but the Baudelaires know from experience that the fungus will kill them within an hour, so they race off to the arboretum to find a solution. There is no horseradish or wasabi in the kitchen, so they try reading their parents' record, which clues them in that the apple tree above them is a hybrid tree that produces bitter apples. They cure themselves by eating one of the apples. The Baudelaires rush to try to save everyone with more apples, but the colonists are already leaving on a boat as the coastal shelf floods. Ishmael has convinced them that the coconut cordial will save them (though drinking it has just made them stupid), and they refuse to take any more help from the Baudelaires because they perceive that they are the cause of this mess. Their snake goes after the boat with an apple, so there is a possibility that they might have survived, but that is left open. In the meantime, the orphans must help Kit Snicket give birth. She has also been poisoned by the fungus, but won't take an apple because it will harm her baby. Count Olaf appears, also poisoned, and the Baudelaires convince him to do one good thing in his life and carry the pregnant woman to a safe place so she can give birth. He actually does so--and kisses Kit in the process!--but even though he eats an apple and cures his fungus infection too, there is a wound in his chest from the harpoon, and he dies. So does Kit. And the Baudelaires name her daughter after their mother, and raise her on the island, with all the devices and information in the arboretum to help them. An unprecedented chapter fourteen epilogue shows the Baudelaires a year later, having raised the baby girl and perused the island's history (also called \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\"). They add verses to the book themselves and explore the collection of wonderful devices, books, and kitchen implements, but then decide to depart when the coastal shelf floods again. Off they go with plenty of food and entertainment, in the vessel they came in. They pull off the nameplate that read \"Count Olaf\" and see that the boat was originally named Beatrice . . . which is also their mother's name and the new baby's name. That answers a lot of questions, but we still don't know what was in the sugar bowl, who lived and who died in various disasters (including the older Baudelaires' love interests and some former guardians), and what happened to them after they rejoined the world.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Entertaining but not entirely factual</td><td>2.0</td><td>I'll admit this book is fun and a good bathroom read, but don't go to parties and quote passages from it to appear well-informed and intelligent.

Several reviewers have criticized some of the ways information is presented in this book for the sake of political correctness, as well as some of the opinions about works discussed.  I think all the reviewers of this book make valid points.  Everybody knows what AD and BC mean, there's really no reason at this point to reinvent the wheel. The section on Art included a few prickly elements for me.  I personally was annoyed by some of the superlatives used to describe many of the artists.  The section on seeming like you know what you're talking about at an art exhibit is so funny, however, that it totally makes up for it.  :)  In all fairness, art is one of the hardest things to write about clearly since it's so personal for whoever is viewing it.  Look up the artists listed so that you can see some of the pictures yourself and make up your own mind! Those small picadillos aside, there's sooo much to enjoy here that the good far outweighs the bad.  The sections are well organized, and the authors do a great job of bringing historical figures to life with great stories. Many trivia books can be read for about an hour at a time. This is a trivia book that can be read for hours on end and still not make you feel overloaded.  The bite-size bits of info are easy for anybody to swallow! All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this book.

They do less harm than the sane.\"</td><td>4.0</td><td>Deftly juggling four separate plot lines, Michael Gruber's challenging mystery focuses on Emmy Lou Dideroff, a woman with a checkered past, who has been a postulant in a religious nursing order.  Found in the Miami hotel room of a Sudanese oil merchant who has just been pushed out of a tenth floor window, Emily is talking earnestly  with St. Catherine of Siena when the police arrive, willing to confess to a murder of which she may be innocent because \"it would be an honor to be executed unjustly, like Jesus.\" Tito Morales, the first officer on the scene, soon becomes the partner of Iago Xavier (Jimmy) Paz, another Cuban-American police officer and a main character in Gruber's previous novel, Tropic of Night.  Their relationship with Major Oliphant, formerly with the FBI, and with other federal agencies, as the investigation unfolds, constitutes another subplot, as roadblocks are constantly erected by both the Department of Justice and the FBI. Lorna Wise, the psychologist in charge of Emmy Lou's competency hearing, becomes her therapist/advocate, and it is to Lorna that Emmy Lou's \"confession\" in a series of notebooks is addressed.  Though Lorna herself is not religious, she feels an inexplicable connection to Emmy Lou, and the reader soon discovers that Lorna has problems of her own.  Throughout the novel, historical information is interjected about the Nursing Sisters of The Blood of Christ, the religious order in which Emmu Lou Dideroff was a postulant, and about its founder, Marie-Ange de Berville. As the investigation moves from Miami to the Sudan, Gruber provides detailed information about the anthropology of the Dinka tribe in Sudan, the ethnographic conflicts which have threatened them with extinction, their powers of magic and sorcery, and the mystical connections they have with their surroundings, calling into play issues far greater than those of the local murder investigation. Gruber keeps the reader interested, not only in the story but in the unfolding characterizations and interrelationships of his offbeat characters.  By withholding key information about them, the author keeps the interest high, further ratcheting up the suspense through the complexities of the plot, with its increasing mayhem.  Not just a shoot-'em-up, this mystery novel raises fascinating questions about psychology, religious mania, and responsibility, and as the threads come together in the conclusion (and somehow they all do), the tight construction and careful plotting pay off with a blockbuster resolution.

It starts out with Shadow in prison, soon to be released.  On the eve of his release, he finds out his wife (Laura) has just died and that he's getting released early.  Shadow travels back home for his wife's funeral.  Along the way, he encounters Mr. Wednesday, who acts oddly and seems to know more about Shadow than he should.  Shadow tries to ditch Mr. Wednesday, only to have him turn up again like a bad penny.  It seems Mr. Wednesday wants to hire Shadow to work for him.  After several drinks of mead, Shadow agrees.  The work mostly entails driving Mr. Wednesday around, and, should he die, holding a vigil for him.  Slowly Shadow realizes there is more to Mr. Wednesday than he imagined.  Known by many other names, Odin is the most prominent, a God.  Odin and Shadow travel America searching out others to help them in the upcoming war.  Gods originally arrived in America via the belief of the people who traveled to America.  Over time, belief in Gods has wained and been replaced by technology and cultural fads.  Lack of belief weakens them and has caused many of the American Gods to lead a life of mere existence rather than the life enjoyed in their glory days. This was an interesting read.  Not really like the other works I've read by Gaiman, but his stamp is still on it.  I liked coming to the realization of who the various Gods were as Shadow was drawing the same conclusions.  I must admit, I was slow on the uptake and didn't realize who one was until the very end (though this was as intended since that's when Shadow realizes it as well).  I think in the end, I was hoping for a bit more fantasy or supernatural elements, thus the 4 star rating instead of 5.  The supernatural elements were there (we are talking about Gods after all), but they were underplayed and supplemental versus the main focus.  The story really is about Shadow's journey. Some good quotes: \"Every hour wounds.  The last one kills.\" \"Shadow had heard too many people telling each other not to repress their feelings, to let their emotions out, let the pain go.  Shadow thought there was a lot to be said for bottling up emotions.  If you did it long enough and deep enough, he suspected, pretty soon you wouldn't feel anything at all.\" \"...a town isn't a town without a bookstore.

Most of the book is split between the main character, Shadow's, inner musings and an exploration of the America countryside. Unfortunately neither of these things are particularly interesting. Shadow is about as engaging as a blank wall, he reacts to every fantastical thing with utter disinterest. The road trip aspect is also incredibly boring. Very little time is actually spent with the various gods, and that time is underutilized. The climax of the story is underwhelming, and most certainly not worth the read. Would not recommend.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Same rating as \"Tropic of Night\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>but a definitely superior product. [For me, five stars is a rarely attainable maximum, the one that only the \"hundred you'd take to the desert island where you're marooned\" get, so I'm somewhat restricted in my four-stars awards. If Amazon's rating system allowed it, I'd give \"Valley of Bones\" (\"VoB\") 3+ stars]. The plot is aptly summarized both in Amazon's ed rev, and in Gail Cooke's and Kay Day's excellent and more detailed ones (with which I agree), so I won't repeat it here. Obviously, Gruber has taken the trouble to read widely on the subject. He's also able to invent a very ingenious and very complicated, many-layered story (you'll savour it more if you read it twice, as on a first perusal it seems less plausible than when you know the ending, and the second time, page-turning urgency gone, you pay more attention to the details), full of twists wound around a theme told at two different levels, let's call them naturalistic and numinous to simplify. His most risky character, the nun, is well portrayed (I actually have a couple of female Catholic friends that, while quite lower on the \"fundamentalist sanctity\" scale, could conceivably hold the same beliefs and attitudes). The epiphany is very convincing and masterfully depicted: when she shouts \"filthy filthy ... !\", for example, you feel it could have been taken from a real experience, and is actually quite a respectable attempt to reconstruct and repeat -with a difference- a historical episode (I'm sorry to be so vague, but otherwise I'd be giving away too many details of a scene that merits to be read by \"virgin\" minds). This numinous level version is also more believable than that of ToN, perhaps because its main episodes are placed before the end, and so the denouement is much more rational and \"whodunitic\". The other two main characters are also tolerably well depicted, although less so than the nun's (Paz and his mother are, as in ToN, two cliched Cubans, while Dr. Wise is, at least at the beginning, a bit of a Woody-Allenish caricature, not really suited to the mood of the book). Miami and Florida are described rather well, the city's and its police's corrupted atmosphere coming through more believably, and in a less annoying language, than, say, in Stone's \"King of Swords\". The African part is superb, sounding both matter-of-fact and exotic. I'm not qualified to judge whether the account of Garigeau's/Dideroff's infancy in Florida and teenhood in Blue Ridge with the white supremacist philosopher and drug dealer Orne (IMO one of the least plausible of the book's characters) is believable. For me, it was the least interesting part of the novel, and the most contrived (I mean, really, could there be people so crime-prone that don't get caught?). The writing is vivid, and there are four distinct narrations in different styles: I would say a virtuoso performance (I assume the first parts of the Order's history are written to parodize some Saints' bios). All in all, I would say that IMO, for somewhat intellectual tastes, this should the best thriller (if it can at all be confined to that genre, although I think it trascends it) around. Why then not four stars? For two main reasons: (1) The book is essentially the same as ToN (although of course with different personages except the here almost monogamous Paz, and Barlow, and their families; different type of numen involved -although there's some Santera as well, but it's secondary-; different African setting; much more \"international\" and ramified plot; slightly different and more believable story development, as already noted above); in particular, the modes of description of the epiphanies, although with different meanings and actors, are almost identical. (2) The resolution is implausible. CAUTION: PERHAPS LIGHT SPOILER AHEAD! For example, how did the perps know Emily would fall into a trance and so be conveniently around when Paz entered the suite? More basic, how did they know Morales and Paz would be the cops who first arrived? Different ones might have acted differently. LIGHT SPOILER ENDED. Or, is it believable that a Government psychiatrist could spirit away a patient interned by a judge in a Gov hospital, without neither consequences nor investigation into the disappearance? There are other examples of not very credible situations in the novel (a one-legged, or at least with only one foot, person parachuting? Etc.). (3) Also, although this is a minor quibble, the book must have been finished in a rush: there are some verb tense confusions (especially in Lorna's part, which is told in the present tense), and some negatives are missing from Emmylou's (or else some sentences would have no meaning). To conclude: VoB is a four-star book if you aren't acquainted with Gruber's ToN, a three-star one atherwise. Eminently worth reading in any case. I won't however buy the third Paz volume.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Do not read this review</td><td>2.0</td><td>If you are interested in book reviews that have happy endings, you would be better off reading some other review. Because this review, like so many others, is more likely to make you hide in your cellar than prompt you to give your credit card number to complete strangers to order a copy of \"The End.\" Unfortunately, like other series of books that start out splendidly, a word which here means \"with interesting characters and fascinating plots,\" the last book in the chronicle of the Baudelaire's lives ends not with a bang but a whimper. The phrase \"not with a bang but a whimper\" was penned by a man named Thomas, who was a close associate of mine until he left one day for New Guinea in a generically-fueled speed boat, all because of a note left in a cookie jar by a hotel concierge. The exact meaning of the phrase is ambiguous to some and downright confusing to others, but to my way of thinking, the best manner in which to use \"not with a bang but a whimper\" is in reference to an entertaining series of books that end not with plot resolution but with more unanswered questions. Unfortunately, that is how \"The End\" ends - with more unfortunate happenings that leave the unfortunate reader with the unfortunate sensation of having unfortunately wasted his or her time reading an unfortunate ending, unfortunately. That brings me to a problem that plagues the whole series of unfortunate events, and that is the repetitive nature of the books, a word which here means \"Lemony Snicket deems it necessary to repeat the same sentence structure and subtle jokes ad infinitum throughout the series.\" This literary technique, a word which here means \"way of writing a book,\" is novel the first few times it is tried, but after reading through 170 chapters filled with repetitive phrases, a word which here means \"the same phrases over and over again,\" one tends to become disinterested, a word which here means \"bored,\" or downright angry, a word which here means \"why am I reading this book?\" Mr. Snicket's stories also tend to fall into abject pessimism, a which here means \"a depressing view of the world,\" which might make good reading for hermits and old maids but not high-spirited little children. If you have read this much of my review - which I certainly hope you have not - then you must be wondering what redeeming qualities Lemony Snicket's unfortunate series of unfortunate books may have. While it is true that \"The End\" leaves one whimpering, it is equally untrue that the series should not be read. Books one through 11 are quite entertaining, a word which here means \"worthy of being read.\" Unfortunately, Mr. Snicket begins to wax philosophical in the two closing books of the series. By \"wax philosophical\" I do not mean that Mr. Snicket uses a putrid smelling and oily substance to buff and shine his automobile, which he has nicknamed \"philosophical.\" Rather, \"wax philosophical\" means that Mr. Snicket attempts to examine the nature of good and evil, often with rather embarrassing results. Mr. Snicket's liberal views on politics, morality, religion, and \"pelosi\" (a word which, when translated, means \"his choice to live in San Francisco rather than Vermillion, South Dakota\") may be interesting in a debate, but they serve as a mere annoyance in a children's yarn. That being said, the first eleven books are entertaining and enjoyable, words which here mean \"worthy of being read, even if the last two books are horrid.\" There are some books, of course, that are better left unread, and I am sorry to say that \"The End\" is one of those. While it is wise to avoid \"The End,\" it is definitely unwise to avoid many of the other books in the series. So, if you can look past the repetitive prose and odd humor, pick up the first few books in the series, but expecting a decent resolution to the storyline would be an unfortunate event indeed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of the best \"thrillers\" I have read</td><td>5.0</td><td>A complex and intriguing story, written with such intimacy I felt that I knew the heroine personally.

It's an excellent novel but like those one in a thousand novels, it asks the reader to work as hard as the writer. The benefits of the story won't come to you unless you're willing to role up your sleeves. Like LeCarre, Michael Gruber makes the reader commit to effort. Jimmy Paz is a pretty boy. He gets to wear $1000 dollar suits because he is just that. He's well cut and he wants his suits to be well cut. He demands that of his new partner, Tito Morales, a rookie cop called to a Miami Hotel over a disturbance. The disturbance? 'One of the guests tried to fly,' he tells Paz when Jimmy rolls in . . . 'from the tenth floor.' Paz is promiscuous. He's a gigolo without the capital \"G.\" Oh yeah, and he has a violent, violent temper. Oh yeah. One other thing. He cuffs himself to his bed because he walks in his sleep. Lorna Wise is a psychologist, a state employee by choice, a PhD who doesn't want the exposure of private practice. As full of himself as Paz is she's an empty sack, sleeping with married men and collegues, ashamed of her body (which ain't bad, we are told) and ashamed of herself, outside and in. She's a mess. Oh yeah. She thinks she's doomed to die. Soon. She makes 'acute hypochondria' sound as simple as an ad for Johnson & Johnson bandaids. These are interesting people but they're Booster Club Moms and Dads compared to Emmylou Dideroff, drug dealer, revolutionary, hooker, nun, ecstatic, and frequent conversationalist with saints. Deceased saints. Here's just a note from the mouth of Emmylou: \"What passes as goodness between us fallen human beings is generally not more than a mutual picking of lice from our fur, and a suspension of our desire to eat eachother up. It is only social goodness.\" How do you get to meet these three people? Well, Mike Gruber weaves a troika of stories. First there's the History of The Sisters of The Blood of Christ. Then there's the confessions of Emmylou Dideroff, as she writes them over the course of four notebooks imprisoned in a state mental hospital for the murder of the flyer. Seems evidence points to his takeoff as being non volitional. Oh. Would you like to guess who is her therapist? And then of course is the murder mystery itself which by now has graduated to a multiple murder mystery. One last point. Lee Burke mentioned earlier and John Connolly both have characters who speak to the dead. This is occasionally unrealistic and awkward. Gruber pulls this off seamlessly.

After reading Book 12 (\"The Penultimate Peril\") I had reserved judgment.  Though less enjoyable in its own right, it might possibly justify itself if it became apparent, in retrospect, that it was building up to something worth while. Not so.  \"The End\" fails so badly, that not only does it drag \"The Penultimate Peril\" into the abyss along with it, but it also detracts from most of the other entries.  Many of the late entries in the series varied intriguingly from formula in a manner that seemed to promise that they were part of something more than a somewhat repetitive series of stand-alone adventures.  This promise has been exposed as a lie.  It is here revealed that there was no real build-up, no over-arching story line, and no real plan.  The \"clues\" thrown out to create an aura of mystery were never really clues -- just a sort of increasingly-unfunny comic schtick.  None of those little mysteries he builds up in the early volumes will be resolved here.  Some of the early stories perhaps still hold up well enough as stand-alone adventures, but they were never ever more than that. Perhaps it was only to be expected that, since Book 12 offered us a \"denouement\" that was not really a denouement (even according to his careful explanations of the meaning of the word), this final book would give us an \"End\" that was not really an End. The series just fizzles out in a miasma of despair that no longer seems to be a joke (and which, in any event, has certainly ceased to be funny).  This, unfortunately, includes moral despair.  Over the course of the last few volumes, the author has torn down the distinction between hero and villain (in a preachy and heavy handed manner) while still clearly expecting us to retain full sympathy for the heroes.  The unmistakeable message is that growing up necessarily involves abandonment of one's moral principles, as one prepares to survive in a hostile world.  So, essentially, not only does he himself cop out on resolving the plot, but he is also advocating moral cowardice to his child readers. Do not mistake Snicket's moral despair for moral sophistication.  The series never beomes \"morally complex\" -- it never begins to approach even the moral complexity of the Harry Potter books.  Snicket does not advocate a complex moral code; he merely suggests that, since a simple one does not work, we should join him in wringing our hands (presumably as a prelude to washing them of responsibility).  Snicket's outlook is so morally unsophisticated that, in his zeal to equate heros and villains, he at one point ignores the distinction between intentional murder and an accident. The Baudelaire children are left, finally, with only their elitism to console themselves.  Even if they, too, have become \"villains\" like Count Olaf, at least they are still special in the sense that they are still smarter, prettier, and generally superior to the surging masses of stupid ugly humanity. Meanwhile, as plot and morality slide into the abyss, we begin to detect the ugly stench of Allegory amidst the chaos.  My suspicions of allegorical intent were horribly confirmed when Sunny uttered a certain word beginning with \"D\".  I will say no more of this, if you dislike allegory as much as I usually do, such revelations are bound to spoil any enjoyment of even the earlier books. I did get a couple of chuckles from Snicket's usual word-play.  Though few and far between, these moments of amusement have nonetheless inspired me to give this book 2 stars rather than the minimum of 1.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Learned a lot!!</td><td>4.0</td><td>My niece has lost 64 lbs so far following the South Beach Diet plan.

Carlo D'este is a fabulous military historian. D'este has done something very rare, which is simply to tell the story of a major battle,from the generals' arguments to the crazed, terrifying stories from the soldiers crouching in holes in the ground. Anzio was an operation which had already been considered and rejected. D'este shows that the responsibility for this disaster rests almost entirely upon Winston Churchill, who single-handedly rescued the battle plans from the trash and placed them on the drawing board. Unfortunately, Churchill didn't provide any solutions to the weaknesses of the plan; instead he used sleight of hand to make it appear that the plan would work and bullied his subordinates into accepting it. Most American readers are unaware of the damage that Churchill did to the Allied cause. Although he was a brilliant and essential political leader, he'd always yearned to be a successful commander in the field, and his wish to be a military hero blinded him and prevented him from listening to better qualified men and led him to drag England, and the Allies, into spectacular mistakes like the campaigns in Greece and in Norway. Although his \"soft underbelly\" argument, which led to the tragic and costly Italian campaign, made sense-surely the Americans and British had to do something to help while the Russians fought the Germans-one wonders whether the invasion of Italy ever justified the titanic casualties which it caused. The foreseeable stalemate on mainland Italy led logically to Operation Shingle, the landings at Anzio. D'este shows that, beyond landing the troops, Allied leadership had no real idea of what they wanted to accomplish there. Something about Italy...Churchill wasn't the only bad leader the Alllies relied on there. Mark Clark,commander of the Fifth Army,had a titanic ego and gradually came to mistrust and hate his English counterparts. One story,which D'este repeats,has him threatening to have US troops fire on any English soldiers who attempt to enter Rome ahead of the Americans. A great deal of this book is spent putting the campaign in context and in telling the stories of the men who fought at Anzio. Unlike many historians D'este has no difficulty moving back and forth between the Big Picture and the story of the poor bastard who's crouched in a ditch, terrified and praying that the enemy troops go around his position. D'este is certainly one of the finest American historian when it comes to the Mediterranean Theatre and this is his finest book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>D'Este's Best Campaign History to Date...</td><td>5.0</td><td>Since the passing of the late Stephen Ambrose, Carlo D'Este has probably assumed the mantle of America's leading World War II historian and author. This work was his fourth dealing with military events in the European theater (and in this case, the third dealing with the Mediterranean). You probably won't find a better, more detailed account of the Anzio battle than in this book. It's well researched, very detailed and a quick moving read. I gathered that D'Este believed that the Allies weren't all that allied and the Germans, outnumbered and outsupplied, simply took advantage of Allied mistakes and blunders and nearly made \"Operation Shingle\" a total disaster. D'Este clearly admires Mark Clark's bravery, but questions his strategic abilities. He finds Alexander personally likeable, but one of the least decisive theater commanders of the war and Kesselring, daring, resourceful and opportunistic. The General he admires most is without a doubt, Lucian K. Truscott Jr, first commander of the famous U. S. Third Infantry Division, then is elevated to 6th Corps command when Lucas is relieved. The way the author marshalls his facts, you will find it hard to disagree. But to me, the hero of the book is the ordinary land soldier, the men who endured the barbarous fighting, the nightmarish stalemate and the eventual breakout of the beachhead. This is a superb piece of military history and well worth the time it will take to read it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Combines historical analysis with first  hand accounts</td><td>4.0</td><td>Carlo D'Este has written a series of books on the often-overlooked Italian campaigns of World War II.  D'Este skillfully combines detailed historical analysis with interesting first hand accounts.  The result is a highly readable book.  The author uses the first several chapters to set the scene and explain the historical significance of the operation.  There are extended passages on the conflicts between the Allied commanders.  The central section of the book describes the actual conduct of the operation.  The chapters cover the battle at the tactical level and include many short personnel stories.  The author moves easily from strategic conflicts between Allied generals to the day-to-day struggle of the infantrymen in the mud of Anzio.  The author is not afraid to state an opinion and all views are backed up by significant evidence.  This makes the work more than just a collection of war stories.  The only quirk I found was D'este obvious admiration of German generals and the German military in general.  While he goes to great length to point out the weakness of Allied leadership, the Germans are let off rather lightly, despite the fact that in the end they lost.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>This Book Should be Titled \"The Middle\"</td><td>3.0</td><td>I was expecting all my questions to be answered in \"The End.\"  Lemony Snicket has led the reader in the previous twelve books on a quest to uncover the secrets of the organization V.F.D., to which the Baudelaire's parents belonged.

The writing style seems a bit rushed in Snicket's attmept to finish the story with book number \"unlucky\" 13.

But \"Sex With Kings: 500 Years of Adultery, Power, Rivalry and Revenge\" is a genuinely engrossing book, full of funny and tragic stories about royal mistresses through history. From Madame de Pompadour to Camilla Parker-Bowles, Eleanor Hermann studies these controversial -- sometimes fascinating -- women. There are mistresses of all types: married and single, noble and low-born, beautiful and ugly, smart and stupid. Some befriended the queens, some attacked (and were attacked by) them. Some died alone and unhappy, some became nuns, and some lived in luxury to the end. Some were sweet and pious, and some were nightmares. Hermann studies why the kings got involved with these women, and how brains and sweet natures could mean a lot more than a pretty face. They could (sometimes) influence politics, succession, and their illegitimate children were sometimes better-loved than the king's legitimate kids. The mistresses themselves are a colorful bunch, from the bratty, grasping Lola Montez, bawdy Nell Gwynn, pious Louise, and the legendary Madame de Pompadour. One of the most memorable is the grasping Madame de Montespan, who used black magic to ensnare the king, only to eventually drive him into the arms of a \"batlike\" governess. Yes, it's called \"Sex with Kings.\" But it's not all about sex -- in fact, it becomes clear that sex is only one factor. Hermann does a pretty good job of studying all angles of mistresshood. Sure, a mistress sometimes got the prettiest dresses and jewels, but she could be kicked out on a whim. There were dozens of setbacks, and only a very wily mistress could avoid them. The author also devotes attention to the mistress's children, her lover the king, and sometimes the mistress's husband. Even the unfortunate queen gets a chapter, as well as the occasional mistress who married the king. But Hermann keeps it funny and light as well. One particularly funny story is of a plain German princess and a French transvestite prince -- both of whom ask how they can possibly sleep with the other. But she doesn't avoid the touchier issues of mistresses either, like the religious or political angles. Nor does she cater to double standards by blaming either the kings or mistresses. Hermann finishes up the book on a promising note, pointing out recent marriages between royal men and the title-less women they love. But even if mistresshood is a thing of the past, the unique story of these women is well mapped-out in \"Sex With Kinds.\" A fun and unique read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Rex Sex</td><td>2.0</td><td>If you are looking for salacious, sexy history, don't bother to read \"Sex with Kings.\" The title is the best thing about the book. Although the author examines the lives and times of royal mistresses from the 15th century to the present, she does not inbue her history with any raciness or sense of the personalities involved at all. This is just rather routine recitations of the perks and pains of being a maitresse en titre. The book is organized by topic rather than chronologically, which makes for confusion and a rather choppy read. All in all, a stronger come-on than pay-off.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A brilliant conclusion</td><td>5.0</td><td>The final book of in A Series of Unfortunate Events\" provides some closure, but not all questions raised in the series are answered.  While this may frustrating to some, I found it brilliant - rarely in life are there tidy results and clear answers to all our questions, just as there are very few happy endings.  That Snicket concludes his stories of the Beaudelaire orphans in a similar manner is in keeping with the tone of the previous books.  To wrap things up with a \"happily ever after\" ending would be as much of a let down as it would be an insult.  No apologies need be made; its a great story (the strongest in a while), and a wonderful conlusion.  Recommended.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>What A Scandal</td><td>3.0</td><td>In Sex With Kings, a companion volume to Sex With The Queen, Eleanor Herman sheds light on royal men and the mistresses they took. At least in part, the implication is that royal men took mistresses not only because they wanted to, but to demonstrate to their courts that they were virile and vigorous. An overactive sex drive was (and to a certain extent, continues to be) an expected trait in men, and the king was supposed to be the manliest man of all. But the services that a royal mistress was to provide went far beyond sex (look no further than Madame de Pompadour, whose sexual relationship with King Louis XV ended long before her reign as royal mistress ended): she was to provide pleasant companionship to the King whenever he wanted it. That meant being available at all times, never being snappy or rude (although some mistresses were famous for quick tempers, most were not), never complaining of any inconvenience. They were rewarded with fancy rooms in the palace, titles, and estates, but those could be stripped when a new favorite was installed, so the smart ones got jewels and cash. This book was actually published prior to Sex With The Queen, and I think Herman learned from her issues with Sex With Kings in writing the second book. While the structure is fairly similar (a topic, like the children of mistresses, is the focus of each chapter and various examples are highlighted to illustrate it), Sex With The Queen also took a deeper dive into a few stories, like Catherine the Great, and told them straight through. I think that approach was ultimately more successful than the one used in this book, which has a few women to whom it constantly returns (Madame de Pompadour, Madame du Barry, Louise de Keroualle, Lady Castlemaine, and Lola Montez are particular favorites). You don't really get a sense of the full scope of these women's lives as their stories get told piecemeal, and it can get confusing to try to keep them and all their details straight. I found myself having to flip back, try to remember which king they were attached to, who their rivals and predecessors were, what country and era they lived in. Along with the issues with the way in which the stories were told, Herman's fondness for cheesy physical description gets a little eye-roll-y at times. The women seem to uniformly have \"cascading hair\", \"sparkling eyes\", and a \"dazzling complexion\". I like that she's trying to make the mistresses and their lives and struggles feel contemporary and real instead of something out of a stuffy history book, but I think their stories are compelling enough without the gushy language. That all being said, these are interesting stories and ones which we don't usually come across. Herman does a good job of shedding light on details we might not usually think about when it comes to how these women's lives actually played out behind the scenes, and this would be a great starter book if you're interested in this kind of thing, like I am, and want to get ideas about biographies you'd like to explore. I'd heard of Madame de Pompadour before, and the information in this book was definitely enough to make me interested in reading more about her!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Read it and used it with great results</td><td>5.0</td><td>This book has changed my life.

Sex with great figures of history, Kings, is even more interesting. To me, this was a fascinating read. I enjoyed reading about the trials the mistresses went through, and even sympathized with them. I actually wish there had been more on Camilla, the mistress of Prince Charles, but oh well. I think the most intriguing mistresses were Louis XIV's mistresses. The book was informative on what the life of a mistress was like, the public's feelings towards mistresses, what happened to royal bastards, things like that. It's intersting that some mistresses, such as Madame Pompadour who ran the Seven Years War, shaped history. Others were fostered on the king so as to gain political influence such as Louise de Keroualle from France who was mistress to Charles II, basically she was a pawn of the king of France and tried to influence Charles II. All in all, if you enjoy reading about bawdy things, check this book out.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of the best endings, or one of the worst... still not sure!</td><td>4.0</td><td>Having read the entire series one book at a time for the last few years, I read this book pretty quickly, wanting an easy-to-understand ending. This book doesn't provide that. My first reaction was to think that this book explained nothing. But the more I mull it over, the more I believe that this *isn't* the case, that all the answers *are* in the book, but that the author's intent is to make us have to work really really hard to dig all the answers out. A single, fast read just won't work. After thinking it over, I'm pretty sure I know who Beatrice is; Handler (Snicket) seems to spell this out explicitly via a number of clues that are spread through the entire series. I'm also pretty sure that Count Olaf didn't start the fire that orphaned the Baudelaires, and that this fire was actually set by a most unexpected source. In other words, it may be that the entire series, especially this book, provides all we need to understand all the mysteries. But digging out the information takes work. I could be wrong, and won't know until I re-read the entire series. And re-reading these books is something I never thought I'd want to do... until I finished this book! Four stars instead of five only because I may be reading more into this first quick reading than the author intended.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>It Is Done.</td><td>5.0</td><td>After years of being a ASoUE fan, I was kinda sad to see this day come.  But I wanted to read it before I happened upon any spoilers.

There are several gags that little kids are going to pass over, as in most of the other books, but it's still a good read for the [...] year old crowd.  It's a bit dark and morbid, but in a honest & true to life manner. The illustrations are also once again very nice & really add to the feel of the book.  They add to the humor and make you feel more attached to our favorite orphaned siblings. It's slightly heartbreaking, and somewhat surprising but is a nice end to the series.  He's quite the talent and this series deserves a place on your child's bookshelf.

It is an easy non-complicated book that may start some readers off as future history fans. I think this book would be good as a supplement to a college freshman western civilization history course. If I was teaching European history to freshmen, I would use this book, along with other more scholarly books, but I think this book is very humorous, entertaining, and full of nasty details about the intimate lives of the powerful. It may make history come alive for those who find history boring. There is one major problem with the book. Herman decided to group her chapters around various themes, such as the rivalry between the queen and the king's mistress, or the husband of the king's mistress, the riches to be obtained as the king's mistress, the potential political power that might be obtained, the issue of royal bastards, public opinion of the mistress, and the change of winds that occur when the king dies before his mistress. This would appear to be a very sensible way to organize the chapters, however it also means that each chapter is full of small paragraphs on each amorous couple and thus the text seems disorganized and choppy. If Herman had selected 12 royal mistresses and then followed the themes she identifies within each of these stories, the text would have been more easily understood and the narrative flow would improve. That being said, the various adventures in this book were very entertaining. The story of Anthenais de Montespan and Louis XIV was a highlight of the book. Anthenais is obsessed with remaining as the king's favorite, involved in attempts to keep all beauties away from the eyes of the king while giving him secret love potions. Yet she is trumped by her children's old maid governess, Madame de Maintenon, who eventually becomes the king's legal wife after the death of the Queen. This is a fascinating twist of fate, and yet as Louis XIV grew older and more mature, it would only seem natural that he was less interested in exotic young beautiful lovers and became interested in a woman of intelligence, character and good judgement. The mistress that receives the most coverage is, of course, Jeanne-Antoinette Etioles, Marquise de Pompadour. This beautiful, refined, intelligent, and sophisticated woman ruled the court of Louis XV, a man of normal intelligence and instincts but not a great thinker or strategist. Pompadour was probably the most influential and powerful of all royal mistresses in Western Civilization, chosing to make critical decisions of state on behalf of the king rather than to worry about jewels and finery. The most entertaining mistress would have to be Lady Castlemaine, lover of Charles II. Her ability to manipulate Charles II, while gathering untold riches for herself, is almost unbelievable. Charles II actually was unable to pay the sailors in his navy because of the funds he spent on Lady Castlemaine. The life of Marie Jeanne du Barry, the final mistress of Louis XV, is a wild tale of a beautiful prostitute, elevated to the role of the King's mistress due to her exceptional beauty, and yet she remained an innocent soul with little intelligence. Comtesse du Barry went into retirement with her jewel collection upon the death of Louis XV. Her jewels were stolen and later recovered in London. By this time the revolution had begun and Louis XVI and Marie Antionette were imprisoned. Comtesse du Barry was able to get permission to go to England to reclaim her jewels at a time when the revolutionary government was not allowing the ruling class to leave France. The ironic thing is that du Barry returned to France with her jewels and soon died on the guillotine. The book ends with the abdication of Edward VIII to marry Wallis Simpson and the affair between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Edward's low intelligence is explored as well as Prince Charles' lack of judgement around his life with Diana. Camilla actually comes across favorably in the final chapters of the book. The book is full of odd sexy stories that might stimulate folks to actually pick up a history book one day.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Royal Slap and Tickle</td><td>4.0</td><td>Sex with Kings by Eleanor Herman is an eminently readable and enjoyable book detailing the stories and influences of mistresses upon royalty throughout the ages. For all the furor over Bill Clinton's escapades and Charles and Camilla, we find that we are actually more prudish now than they were in the \"good old days\" when royalty openly consorted with mistresses, while queens often were relegated to a lonely existence sequestered with their attendants and delivering the obligatory baby every year or so. Seems that being the King's mistress wasn't all about sex; that in a few cases there was no sexual relationship at all. It was more about friendship and companionship-- whomever said \"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown\" certainly knew what s/he was talking about. With arranged marriages to women often from distant countries who barely spoke the same language as the king, much less shared the same customs and interests, kings sought out mistresses with whom they could converse and who understood their needs and wants. Mistresses were also often privy to court gossip that was very valuable to the kings and mistresses often took part in political machinations-- sometimes for good, sometimes not. The mistress, herself, was often in a shaky position-- she had to continuously maintain her position of favor with the king or otherwise she, and any of the children the king might have fathered, could be summarily cast aside for someone else. It was much easier to get rid of a pesky mistress than to get rid of a pesky wife, as Henry the VIII can attest. This book could so easily have been a dull recitation of the affairs of court, but Herman brings out the human side of the mistresses, their constant struggle to maintain their position, the wiles they used to maintain their positions, and the love they often felt for the kings they served. Humorous in parts, the book is a quick, fun read. My only complaint about it is that it could have been better organized; Herman jumps back and forth from mistress to mistress so that it is hard to keep them straight. Other than that, however, this is an enjoyable book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Potential is there....just needs more work</td><td>2.0</td><td>This book has lots of tid bits of relationships between the kings and their mistresses.

This book fits that day perfectly. When you're tired and not feeling 100% ~~ this is the best book to escape into. If you like stories about women and friendship, this one is for you. If you like stories about women struggling to find their place in their little corners of the world, this one is for you. It has it all. Romance, friendship, strong women and a nice cozy tale as the yarn spins. I have not read \"The Shop on Blossom Street\" ~~ in fact, I don't think I have read any of Debbie Macomber's books. I do have some on my bookshelf, but I've never picked it up. I will now especially when I am fighting a bad cold and the back to school blahs. This one is a continuation of \"The Shop on Blossom Street\" with Lydia and her sister, Margaret running the yarn shop. This time Lydia decided to have another knitting class, making socks. Elise, Courtney and Bethanne signed up, each with their own stories. Lydia is in love with the most wonderful man, only to have his ex-wife back on the scene. Elise is a divorcee, living with her daughter due to a failed investment. To make things even more interesting, her ex is back on the scene. Bethanne is struggling with a cheating husband who left her for another woman and raising two teenagers. Strapped for cash, she needed to find something to do and fast. Her daughter, Annie, is heading for trouble and she doesn't know how to stop her. Then there's Courtney, an overweight teenager who lost her mother several years prior and moved from Chicago to Seattle to live with her grandmother while her father's in Brazil. Depressed, Courtney joins the knitting class only because her grandma signed her up. This novel covers a span of a year and is very sweet and predictable ~~ but just warm and fuzzy as can be. Like another reviewer said, having a fairy godfather near the end helps make this book an even more cozy read. I don't know anything about Macomber's books to know if this is typical of her books, but after reading this one, I plan to read her others as well. 8-31-06</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Same Characters, Different Names</td><td>3.0</td><td>While I really enjoyed The Shop on Blossom Street, A Good Yarn simply wasn't.

There was the angry, the broken, and the discouraged women all over again and I found it difficult to fall into the story and get involved with the characters.  Also, these characters were less 3-dimensional than the Blossom Street book; their individual stories a bit more contrived.  Still, Macomber is an excellent writer and it is a well-written story.

She delights in her knitting classes and has just started a new one. The first class, consisting of three women, is a disaster. One is irritable, another lacks basic confidence, and the third is a miserably unhappy teen. It's evident that they do not enjoy each other's company. Lydia dates her gorgeous UPS deliveryman, Brad. Both are concerned about Lydia's sister Margaret, who works in the shop. Margaret definitely is not herself. Lydia has other family concerns, namely her mother, who is badly diminished by her husband's death. Elise Beaumont is retired and, thanks to a crooked real estate developer, broke and homeless. All she can do is live with her daughter, wait for the pending lawsuit, and hope she eventually will get some money back. Intrigued at the thought of knitting lessons, she heads down to Blossom Street to check out A Good Yarn. On her way, for some reason, her thoughts turn to her ex-husband, Maverick. Later she discovers that Maverick also will be staying with their daughter, and the thought is intolerable. What will she do? Bethanne Hamlin is devastated by her divorce. Her sixteen-year-old daughter Annie, damaged by her father's leave-taking, is headed for certain trouble. Yet Annie insists her mother take knitting lessons and signs her up at A Good Yarn. Meanwhile, Bethanne must find a job --- and soon. But she has no marketable skills. Or does she? Courtney Pulanski is spending her senior year of high school with her grandmother in Seattle. She's bored, lonely and overweight. When her grandmother treats her to a sock knitting class at A Good Yarn, she goes along with the idea. Cutting back and forth to each woman's story, A GOOD YARN takes the disparate threads and (okay, I can't resist) knits them together into one warm and snuggly shawl of a tale as the knitters form a supportive community. Readers' interest never lags as they root for each character's triumph over her struggle. The identity of a generous fairy godperson is a delightful addition to the plot. I personally found the ending to be wrapped up just a bit too tidily; however, others will no doubt find it to be a satisfying conclusion. A truly enjoyable read.   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A treasure! Very heartwarming!</td><td>5.0</td><td>There's something so soothing about knitting - the sweet clicking of needles weaving yarn into items made with love. It's a very calming hobby and it's no wonder that the beloved craft has made a resurgence in popularity. So it makes perfect sense for best selling author Debbie Macomber to combine her love of knitting and writing as she takes her readers on a trip back to revisit the lovely little yarn shop on Blossom Street in her latest novel, \"A Good Yarn.\" Lydia Hoffman opened her shop, A Good Yarn, a year ago as a celebration in her life of overcoming cancer twice in her young life. The shop was met with great success, and Lydia had found contentment in her life as she taught her beloved knitting classes and renewed her friendship with her sister Margaret who came to work with her. She also found love with deliveryman Brad Goetz and they planned to be married one day soon. But life has a way of throwing monkey-wrenches into the best lives, and Lydia soon finds herself dealing with heartache as Brad announces that he is back on speaking terms with his ex-wife. As Lydia reels from this crisis-of-the-heart, her sister Margaret is also dealing with problems in her own homelife, and their mother is beginning to experience declining health problems that keep both sisters busy dealing with her care. But as always, her optimism for life, her love for and of family and friends, and her knitting carry Lydia through this rough bump in her life. Customers of Lydia's shop flock to her store to find the best yarns and advice on knitting, but they also find warmth and friendship among the threads.  In interweaving stories, three new ladies join Lydia's sock knitting class, and although they are all from diverse backgrounds and ages, they soon find a connection to each other as they click their needles away. Elise Beaumont has recently retired as a school librarian, but finds her dreams of owning her own home dashed as a con-artist makes off with her investment money. Forced to move in with her daughter, Elise is dismayed when it is announced that her ex-husband, a gambler who had been out of her life for many years, would be paying the family an extended visit. Would their former affection for each other resurface, or would old wounds still be tender? Elise finds an escape in her knitting and joins the sock class as a way of avoiding the tense situations at home. Bethanne Hamlin thought she had a perfect life - a wonderful husband, nice home, and great kids. Then her world was turned upside down when her husband leaves her for a younger woman, and the stay-at-home mom must learn to make ends meet.  As her daughter rebels and the financial situation declines, Bethanne splurges on a knitting class as a way of saving a little of her sanity. As she becomes acquainted with the class, she finds not only friendship but encouragement to pursue her dreams. It seemed unusual for a teenager to be enrolled in knitting classes, but Courtney Pulanski's grandmother thought it would be good for Courtney to try this new activity, in addition to the swimming classes with her senior citizens class. The young girl has come to live with her grandmother while her father is working out of the country, and is somewhat depressed and overweight. Courtney soon finds a sense of accomplishment in her knitting and is surprised to find that the swimming and a new hobby of bike-riding is actually helping her physical appearance as well. When she befriends Bethanne's daughter and son, life takes on a new dynamic that makes it more bearable than the teen could have imagined. The ladies from Macomber's book, \"The Shop on Blossom Street,\" make appearances at the shop, interacting with the new ladies and bringing a sense of continuity to the story that I personally hope will continue in future books. (hint, hint!) \"A Good Yarn\" is a heart-warming book that evokes laughter and tears. Macomber is a wonderful storyteller with legions of fans both in the reading world and now in the knitting world.  This book includes patterns for knitting socks and sage advice from knitting experts sprinkled throughout, tying the story together as neatly as knit one, purl one. Knitters and lovers of women's fiction will find a treasure in among the stitches of this tale.

I needed to lose at least 15 pounds, possibly 20. Hubby, on the other hand, was the first to diet, since he has trouble walking fast or great distance.  I figured this is the most efficient method for him to lose stomach fat!  He effectively needed to lose 20 pounds to be more physically fit for age and health. The South Beach Diet was our choice, and when I saw that he made a change in his life, lost about 20 pounds in few months, I accidently started to lose weight too.  Simply because I was cautious of cooking or buying foods he could not have.  This is about predominatly losing the stomach fat in men.  As for women, you lose it in the hips, butt, and thighs. Make a lifestyle change The book is wonderful in educating you on the safety, health, history of the prescribed changes for dieting.  It is easy without measuring, counting calories, or starving. Lose the Cravings!  Good time to stop bad habits. I sit at a desk and stare into a computer all day, and nibbling always gets into the act, Chinese crackers, that once in a while nutbar, lots of fruit. That was what consisted of most of my nibblings.  So I did have control, but on the diet, you do LOSE the CRAVINGS, just as the book says.  My goal is to eat effectively without gaining the cravings.  And, if you are on the diet for weeks at a time, on or off, it may be a good time to stop any bad eating habits. Recipes, lists, and more There are plenty of recipes for that lifestyle change.  The book also effectively lists the foods to avoid/or lessen in your lifetime, and the Foods to Avoid/Foods to Have in phases 1 and 2.

Religion, legends, myth and science-fiction elements are all whipped up together to tell the story of a journey in the search of the lost city of Ubar, after a suspicious explosion at a museum that contained Arabian relics.  I say it's somewhat-lite because often the reader will be exposed to convoluted scientific explanations or brief, history lessons.  However, neither the scientific nor the historical explanations seemed realistic to me, always shrouded in mysticism or fantasy.  Simply put, I didn't really buy most of what was written, but it was easy to just casually accept it and continue with the story, after all, the Indiana Jones movies were rife with religious connotations.  What I liked best were the numerous action scenes and usage of advanced technology.  I also liked one of the main characters, Painter Crowe, a Native American top-notch agent, highly capable in both military and scientific operations.  The rest of the cast is just okay, some coming across whiny, or even boring.  Omaha Dunn, the adventurer, never really compares to the other main male lead, Painter.  The main female lead, Safia, is not really that interesting either, seemingly just forced to go through the motions of the story. In conclusion, not a book I'd recommend, but if something about the story catches your eye, then it won't be a wasted experience either, at the very least, it would be entertaining enough to warrant the time spent on it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>I love this classic :)</td><td>4.0</td><td>Ah...

I heard of the SBD many years ago when it was first introduced. Like every other fad diet, I dismissed it without even giving it a second glance. \"They never work,\" I said, and went about my happy carb-filled and FAT life. I have always been heavy, and my famliy is full of big people, so losing weight hasn't ever been encouraged at home. I was raised on lots of bread, pasta, potatoes and fattening carbs. I NEVER drank water. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, and it left me feeling depressed and hopeless. I hated how I looked in everything--even though I loved clothes and fashion--because of my weight. I had tried several times to lose weight, to restrict myself, and would average 6-8 lb losses before giving up and reverting back to my old ways. June of '08 I actually found a copy of The South Beach Diet outside in a shopping cart at the grocery store. I picked it up and flipped through it, threw it in the car and thought I might read it. Someday. It sat around the house for a while before I finally picked it up and gave it a go. Immediately I thought, WOW, is this the answer? and then right after that: \"YEAH, RIGHT.\" But, negativity aside, I read the book and decided to give it a try. It made total and perfect sense why I was fat--the book explains the reason behind it and the why and how, and the proof is undeniable. I completely cut out bread, potatoes and pasta, and anything with sugar in it. I followed Phase 1 pretty well for about 4 weeks, and in that time alone, lost about 18 lbs. I would sometimes walk for 10 or 15 minutes here or there, on my lunch at work, or at home around the block, but I wasn't making any real efforts as far as exercise went. However, it was so much more than what I used to do, I started seeing a difference in how I felt and looked almost immediately. As each week passed by and the number on the scale steadily decreased, I found myself feeling more and more energetic, and committed to the new \"lifestyle\". It doesn't feel like you're on a diet, it feels like you're just being HEALTHY. I have never been able to stay on a diet before, but the South Beach Diet is so easy to follow, and the results are so remarkable, I can't even stop myself now! It took me a while to get into the swing of things, but now that I have been doing it, it is natural to me. I was once a skeptic of this and other fad diets, but now I am recommending it to everyone. Even with minimal exercise, to date, I have lost a substantial amount of weight and the best part is--I don't feel hungry or deprived--EVER!!! I really have to give it to Dr. Agatston because even though I have only lost a fraction of the amount of weight I want to lose, I know that it is something I will acheive because of this diet. I stepped on the scale today and had to smile: 224lbs. I haven't weighed that since college (sadly!). I know I still have a long way to go, but I also know that I will make it, and all my thanks goes to Dr. Agatston and his book The South Beach Diet. I urge anyone who is fed up with being overweight, and fed up with diets, to BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It really changed (and IS changing) my life, everyday. I think it can do the same for you too.

Guinness, one of our finest Christian commentators and thinkers, argues that the issue of suffering and evil is our most urgent and serious problem. Evil may have been always with us, but Guinness argues that for the first time in human history, many people no longer have a coherent moral and intellectual framework with which to assess it. More disturbing, we no longer have a shared understanding about whether there even is such a thing as evil. Ironically, while the scale and scope of evil has increased in the modern world, our ability to respond to it has weakened. Because of the \"sorry state of moral illiteracy and intellectual cowardice\" that we moderns find ourselves in, we have a hard time even recognizing evil. Or worse still, we simply make excuses for it. Utopian views of human goodness and a refusal to face reality have resulted in a moral myopia that cannot call evil evil. Indeed, postmodernism compounds the problem, by arguing that calling something evil is the real crime. PoMo has \"spawned legions of people who pronounce all judgments of evil to be judgmental and evil themselves\". Guinness spends a lot of time asking questions about evil and suffering, saving tentative answers for the end of his book. The questions themselves reveal a very deep and nuanced struggle with the issue. Guinness has drawn deeply from the wells of human reflection on, and interaction with, the subject of pain and suffering. His many incisive quotes from a range of authors, thinkers, philosophers and religions are alone worth the price of the book. As part of his investigation, he describes in detail three main responses to the problem of evil. The three main families of faith in the modern world are the Eastern, the secular, and the Judeo-Christian. Eastern responses to evil include that of Hinduism, Buddhism, and much of the New Age Movement. A common theme of the Eastern approach is that there is no real solution to evil in this world, only the renunciation of this world. Freedom from evil means freedom from individuality. If the East is world-denying, the next main option is world-affirming. In the secularist family of faith (atheism, naturalism, secular humanism, etc.) evil is something that we alone must confront. There is no God to help us, so we must create our own paradise on earth. And we have certainly seen some robust attempts in the past century to do just that. Great experiments in producing a new man and a new social order have been tried, but only to be found greatly wanting. The grand social utopias, be they of Stalin, Hitler or Mao have all resulted in the most horrific bloodshed known to man. Secularist regimes with secularist visions of heaven on earth have only led to hell on earth. Indeed, more people were killed by the secularists in the twentieth century than all other ideologies combined before then. The last family, the great monotheistic faiths, has quite a different spin on things. The Judeo-Christian tradition sees evil as an intrusion into this world. Things are not the way they are supposed to be. Evil is unnatural and an intruder. The doctrine of creation tells us about how the world was meant to be, while the doctrine of the fall tells us what has gone wrong. But it does not end there. In the Christian version of things, the doctrine of redemption tells us how evil has been faced head on, and how it has been, and ultimately will be, overcome. Thus we can join in fighting against evil without seen to be fighting against God. God does not abandon us in our struggle against evil. Indeed, \"no other god has wounds,\" Guinness reminds us. In the Eastern view, detachment is the solution. In the secular view, denial or utopianism is the proposed course. In the Christian view, God enters into our predicament, suffers for us and with us, and leads us in the way ahead. The three views could not be more different. In the Christian religion, not only is there a plausible explanation for evil, but there is the conviction that something has been done about it. God has entered human history and confronted sheer evil. And the sheer love of God has defeated this evil. Of course the mystery of evil can never be fathomed, at least in this world. In the Hebrew scriptures a whole book was devoted to the subject. Job asked a lot of questions which were never answered. \"In the end, rather than getting an answer from God, Job encounters God himself, which is his answer.\" The timeless truths of the Christian faith will not satisfy everyone. And as Guinness points out, some of the most anguished cries against God concerning the problem of evil have come from believers, not atheists. The Christian solution must be weighed up and compared to its chief rivals. No one system may completely satisfy. But by means of  a careful presentation of the main alternatives, this book helps to lay out the quite different approaches to this vexatious problem, helping all pilgrims along the way to see more clearly and perhaps more hopefully. If this book ultimately sheds little new light on the subject, it is because it does not claim to do so. It can only restate what has gone before. And this restatement is superbly done. And given the age of terrorism and genocide that we find ourselves in, the demand for a careful restatement is more urgent than ever.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The reviews are funnier than the book</td><td>5.0</td><td>I absolutely positively love the negative reviews of this book.

It was not only different, but challenging and weird, though that doesn't mean it wasn't a good read.  The protagonist, Shadow, is released from jail days early to attend his wife's funeral and begins a surreal journey across America physically and metaphysically as a bodyguard to Mr. Wednesday.  Throughout this journey Shadow meets gods both ancient, or at least an American incarnation, and modern as his employer attempts to rally the older gods to rise up and challenge the newcomers.  Given his special relationship to Wednesday, Shadow is targeted by what seem to be forces in the government and thus has to hide away in the small town of Lakeside.  And throughout all of this Shadow must come to terms with his wife's death, though she keeps on visiting in various locations in the flesh. The structure of the book mainly followed Shadow who, like the reader, is learning that the gods of past are real and very much in the now though because of innate privacy the reader doesn't learn much about Shadow as a person throughout the book.  Yes, we learn things about Shadow but after spending almost 600 pages that his character dominates, we really don't know him.  While some could consider this a flaw, personally I thought it was a strength of the novel.  At the end of some chapters Gaiman, through the writing of Mr. Ibis, describes how gods arrived in America through the travels of their believers.  Throughout the book there are several \"interesting\" scenes which might be disturbing for some readers or just frankly too weird for them.  I'll be honest some of them were pretty out there, but knowing what I was getting into I was able to bare them. After finishing the book, I was glad to have spent the time I did reading it and there is no other thing I can say to recommend it.

He thinks he'll move to Australia. On the way to school he doesn't get a window seat.

He \"could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.\" And on it goes.  So far, his complaints are fairly innoculous.

I have tried both.  On the Atkins diet I lost about 10 pounds in one month, but I had headaches, no energy and felt sick from the zero-carb diet (my body went into ketosis). I had to quit after one month and gained all that weight right back. I've been on South Beach for 3 months now and have suffered no ill effects - in fact this is the healthiest I have felt in years!  Not only am I losing weight like never before (about two pounds per week on average) but my complexion has cleared up, I don't catch every cold that comes along, and I feel great! Unlike Atkins, you do NOT cut out all the carbs - you just cut out the BAD carbs, like sugar and starch.  You give up all the sweets, potato chips and fried foods.  And unlike Atkins, you don't fill yourself with heavy, fatty foods like bacon - you cut out the bad, saturated fats and only eat \"good\" fats. For the first two weeks you have to live without alcohol, fruit and bread - but it isn't really that rough.  It's only two weeks.  During that time, which is called Phase One, your metabalism and body chemistry changes.  After Phase One you don't even crave these foods like you did before. On Phase Two you hardly even feel like you are dieting.  Typical meal for me:  Salmon fillet with asparagus and hollandais sauce, whole-wheat bread roll, green salad with balsamic dressing, red wine and for dessert:  strawberries dipped in dark chocolate!  I don't feel deprived, I eat my fill and I enjoy my meals.  I don't spend a lot of time counting calories, I just weigh in once a day and watch the pounds come off. I never thought I would be able to lose weight like this.  I was a stick figure most of my life, running around in size 5 mini-skirts, eating whatever I wanted without a care in the world - then when I hit my 30's my metabolism finally caved in to bad eating habits and I ballooned up to a size 14 almost overnight. I tried Atkins, I tried Scarsdale, I tried juicing and colon cleanses, I hired a personal trainer and worked my butt off at the gym - and I couldn't put a dent in my weight!  In fact, I gained weight because of all the muscle I put un undernieth the fat! An aquaintence had recommended South Beach to me over a year ago, but I was so gun-shy from all the failed diets that I ignored what she said - until I saw her months later and she had lost 35 pounds!  I realized something must have worked, so I decided to try it - and low and behold it did work and it was FAST!  20 pounds gone in the first two months and I am down to size 8.  People comment to me on how much younger I look.  My double chin is gone, I have cheek-bones again - and all that muscle I got at the gym actually SHOWS!  I can see my knee-caps again, the cellulose is melting away and I really do feel 10 years younger. I still have a long way to go to get back to size 5, but I can actually see light at the end of the tunnel.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a healthy life-style change.  It is well written, easy to follow and very simple.  There are a lot more foods that you CAN eat than what's on the no-no list, and all you really give up is the stuff that's bad for you anyway. Go for it - you have nothing to lose except FAT.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>you must be kidding....</td><td>1.0</td><td>Ummm...I'm pretty well read.  several college degrees.

Wednesday, one of the main characters, is about as cliched as it gets.  So too are the eastern Europeans, the midwestern Wisconsinites, there are characters randomly thrown in with absolutely no value (like the gratuitous Arab cab driver gay sex scene).  His writing is absolutely high school level.  Sure he occasionally hits on all cylinders; the description of the slaver ship coming to the States is riveting, but the words that come to mind to describe the rest of the book - predictable, corny, hackneyed, cliched?  i considered bagging this several times.  Plot was occasionally interesting but I figured it out half way through, and believe me, I'm not usually that sharp.  Thrown together and bizarre if not downright stupid \"battle\" scene.  Ungodly long drawn out (get ON WITH IT already) scenes, like Shadow's vigil on the tree.  Do yourself a favor, read something well written.  This was a clever high school level work.

I've read every one of his books, and I always find myself assuming something supernatural is afoot, only to have Rollins bring in just enough science to make it plausible within the story world. Sandstorm did just that to me, but there was something different from his prior books. I think he's kicked his prose up to a higher, richer plateau. Yes, all the great escapist fiction elements were still there: the can't put down pacing, heart-pounding excitement, characters seemingly trapped with no chance of escape. But this time these elements are presented in a more robust fashion that I found very pleasing. Well done, Mr. Rollins.

Sandstorm not only had awesome characters, plot, and exotic locales, but even an interesting three way love story that's not sappy. Where Ice Hunt was better than it's predesessor, Sandstorm pretty much does the same here.  But just barely.  I instantly got into the new character, Painter Crowe.  But there were quite a few great characters in this novel, both good and evil. Whoever reviews these novels and comments that Rollins has weak and/or one-dimensional characterizations in his novels, surely must have their head stuck in the sand!  Yes, pun intended. Whether writing as James Rollins or James Clemens, jim's written characters breath out life within each and every page of his novels.  His characters are anything BUT one-dimensional.  I saw changes within certain characters as the novel progresses, keeping me that much more interested and turning pages into the wee hours of the night. If you haven't yet tried this extremely talented writer, then you MUST run, not walk, to the nearest bookstore or library nearest you. If you liked such movies as The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, then SANDSTORM, (which is so much better than both of these movies), will sweep you up in a high stakes adventure and blow you away with it's Michael Crighton-type high-tech and mythologically exciting read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>One of my favorite childrens books.</td><td>5.0</td><td>I stumbled across this book years ago when one of my daughters felt life was totally unfair to her.

Rina Lazarus makes a sympathetic character, one that draws the reader into the story, even if they've never personally known any Orthodox Jews.  As a woman, it's easy to identify with this character.  A widowed mother of two little boys, she supports her family by teaching school and working as the mikveh lady at the ritual bath. Author Faye Kellerman also deftly handles some cultural issues that exist within the Jewish community: Rina's less religious parents aren't happy with her choice to live as an Orthodox Jew.  Even in later books in the series, her parents remain distant, bit players in the lives of their daughter and her two sons. Without spoiling the heart of the story, LAPD cop Peter Decker comes into her life after investigating a crime that happens outside the mikveh, the ritual bath house.  The story between them unfolds in a reasonable and believable way, and sets the pace for the entire series of books, which have stretched over twenty-two years.  None of them are as much fun to read as 'The Ritual Bath.'</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Multi-Cultural Mystery</td><td>4.0</td><td>In this novel, the first in a series of stories featuring LA detective Peter Decker and Jewish teacher Rina Lazarus, Kellerman weaves many elements together successfully: there's a crime, a hero (and heroine), the promise of romance, a social message, and enough action to keep the reader interested in both the resolution and the characters.  The story begins with a rape; as heinous as the crime is, the fact that it has occurred in a yeshiva in the Southern California foothills adds even more complications that usual for Pete Decker.  The community of the yeshiva is closed, literally and symbolically, to outsiders.  The only person who seems willing to help Decker is Rina, a young widow who is devoted to `Torah' Judaism, and her sense of duty includes running the mikvah, or ritual bath, for women in their purification after monthly menses.  Rina found the victim, a woman who left the mikvah only to be attacked on her way home.  As the plot unfolds, Kellerman reminds us of the fact that Anti-Semitism is unfortunately alive and well in our own time, even if not intended: the cops, including Decker, refer to the yeshiva as `Jewtown' at the beginning of the novel; later, Rina is accosted by punks in a parking lot, simply because she is Jewish.  Decker balances his pursuit of the yeshiva rapist with another rapist with a similar mode of operation, and the two plotlines intertwine well.  Although I pretty much knew who did the yeshiva rape and why fairly quickly into the novel, the characters kept me interested in following their story: it was obvious that Rina and Decker would have some kind of relationship by the end of the book, despite Rina's devotion to her religion and only dating within it.  Kellerman does add a little bit of `deus ex machina' at the end to smooth the way for future books with these two characters, but that is forgiven, since we do end up caring about them and their relationship.  Definitely a good beginning to a (hopefully) good series.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Well-written debut novel</td><td>5.0</td><td>Police detective Peter Decker is called to an orthodox Jewish community to investigate the rape of one of the women who lives there.  The call is made by the victim's friend, Rina Lazarus, whom Peter is attracted to immediately.  Thus begins a wonderful mystery series which features a strictly religious orthodox Jewish woman, and a man who is indifferent to religion, but not to Rina.  The tension between the two creates a wonderful dance of approach/avoidance and a question as to whether their beliefs or their feelings will reign supreme in their relationship.  Decker becomes acquainted with Rina's two sons and does his best to protect her from any future sexual attacks by the predator who roams the yeshiva community.  The rape occurred near the mikvah where the women go for spiritual purification.  Throughout the book the reader is treated to a background of orthodox Jewish practices and receives a real education in this fascinating religion.  The difficulties in the relationship between Rina and Peter are clearly defined, but the ending leaves room for further development in the other books of the series.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Couldn't stick with the diet...</td><td>4.0</td><td>...but it cured my reflux in just two weeks.

This book is both attractive for readers who appreciate the \"thriller\" as well as for those who are not familiarized with this type of gene.  F.Kellerman elaborates on two parallel plots, the first one being the crime itself (a woman is raped close to the mikvah) and the love relationship between two individuals of different religious background (Rina Lazarus the orthodox Jew and Peter Decker the strong-minded police detective).  The latter plot is more artistically developed and takes precedence over the first one.  The setting is a small Jewish orthodox community on the outskirts of Los Angeles and the meaningful descriptions of orthodox rites are embodied with great moral content.  Well elaborated, main characters with strong structured identities, a most enjoyable reading.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>It works but don't expect miracles</td><td>3.0</td><td>The science behind successful dieting (which is never discussed in this book) is very simple:  You must burn more calories than you eat each day.  If you do so, you will lose weight.  (And that's why you will lose more weight if you exercise more).  The difficulty comes from finding a diet that is feasible for your lifestyle, i.e. one that you can follow without cheating. With that in mind, and after conducting some research, I decided to try South Beach.  I have never gone on a diet before but I felt it was time to shed a few pounds.  If you want to save the cost of the book, the diet can be boiled down succinctly as follows:  For 1 month, don't eat bread, rice, pasta, desserts, most fruits and juices, ice cream or anything with a lot of sugar (including most desserts).  That's really it.  After the 1st month you can gradually add back fruits and a limited amount of fiber-rich products like wild rice and 9-grain bread. The good news:  if you follow this diet you will lose weight!  I lost 7 lbs in 3 weeks even with an occasional deviation.  The bad news:  sticking to the diet will not be easy. The South Beach diet is not rocket science.  Almost every diet encourages people to eat lots of low-calorie rabbit food, i.e. salads, vegetables and fruit, and to avoid high-calorie sugary products like candy, desserts, etc.  The difference with South Beach is that it also encourages people to eat chicken, fish and even beef and pork with the hope that you will feel sufficiently full that you won't be tempted to cheat by eating high calorie low nutrition carbs like bread, rice and potatoes.  And it works if you stick with the plan. However, this diet- like all I've seen - is going to be tough for those who don't have access to these foods during the day.  For example - how is a construction worker supposed to do a salad for lunch?  Cottage cheese?  etc.  And this diet- like all others - fails to provide a good variety of snack options for those of us who don't eat nuts or again have access to refrigeration.  In addition the emphasis on avoiding carbs rather than on counting calories could lead you to some bad decisions.  For example, you will not lose weight by buying a 400 calorie \"low carb\" protein bar rather than a 160 calorie jamba juice drink (both of which are equally filling in my opinion).  Similarly, a 40 calorie popsicle is a lot better for you than some fatty creme dessert (and more tasty too IMO). As for the book itself, it is mostly fluff and could be condensed into about two dozen pages if you eliminate the recipes and daily diets (most of which aren't followed).  However, I still give it 3 stars because I know it has worked for myself and many friends and relatives.  Just remember that most diets fail after about 3 months because people get tired of depriving themselves of prohibited items.  Dr. Agatson believes that you will have less desire for sweets and carbs if you give them up for a month or two, but that remains to be seen as evidenced by the number of people who regain their weight within a year.  However, if you permanently alter your habits by giving up those 500 calorie Starbucks scones and eating more salads, you will be successful.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Stunning Book</td><td>5.0</td><td>I want to start off by saying that I loved this book. It captured my interest right away and kept it all the way through. I've been telling everyone about it and can't wait to get my hands on another book by Gaiman. The storyline is unique and off the wall and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Then there is the writing. Gaiman is a master of language. There are even passages I marked because I loved them so much and want to reread them again later. All that being said, I did not race through this book, but savored it. It took me a while to read because I didn't want to rush it.. It is not only the writing that's intriguing, but the subject matter.  Gaiman explores interesting issues and philosophies, the way our culture has changed since people started coming to North America, and even what has happened since. This all revolves around the gods - the ancient ones from the old country and the new one's of technology and money. Shadow is in jail for a bank robbery and, after three years, is going to be released. He has everything to live for, until he finds out that his wife and best friend (also his future employer) have been killed in a car accident. Shadow leaves jail and goes home, unsure of what he will do. Along the way he meets Mr. Wednesday, who offers him a job. It turns out that Wednesday is an old world god, trying to rally up other gods to fight the new world gods for survival. I don't want to say too much about this book because I don't want to give it away. There are so many twists and turns, rich explorations of ideas, and stunning writing, that it will keep you turning the pages.

It held me for hours. This book is about Rachel Sheridan, whose parents work in Africa as missionary doctor and teacher. Rachel has grown up in Africa, and loves every bit of it. The people, the animals, the land, the sky, the weather. After her parents die from the sudden influenza that strikes Tumaini, where she lives, she has to stay with the Pritchards, her English neighbors who also lost their daughter. Soon, Rachel is caught up in their deceitful, greedy scheme and is being shipped to England to possibly save an old man...by lying and posing as someone she isn't. Though she's in England, trying to tell the truth and yet not succeeding, her heart is still back in Africa with the people of Tumaini. From the maybe third chapter to the end of part two, this book was absolutely fabulous and gripping.

It's not a dud by any means, but there are problems with this book that makes me reconsider whether I should have my students read it or not. I hate to start with constructive criticisms (or negative aspects, if you prefer), but I think the positives have been clearly identified by the other reviews posted here. Nevertheless, my three biggest problems with this YA novel [notice that I pointed out that this is a Young Adult book -- I feel this is very important in reviewing this novel]  are that it is overwritten, filled with melodramatic characters, and the denouement is incredibly long. In claiming LISTENING FOR LIONS to be overwritten, I mean that I found the inexhaustible number of similes, as well as the enormous number of animals and plants mentioned throughout the book seemed so inorganic that I felt like I should have been writing down each one as it is mentioned so that I could be impressed in the end that I had read about so many different examples of the natural world. Enough already! They are distracting from the flow of the writing, and that takes focus from the characters. If writing seems to force in facts or lists or bits of \"clever creative writing\" here or there, it destroys the beauty, the flow, the ease of the story. Next, not all, but many of the characters are just too melodramatic. By this, I do not mean that they seem to over-react and seem to be right out of a soap opera. Instead, I mean that they are characterized by the definition of a \"melodramatic\" character; in other words, they don't change at all from beginning to end. Anyone who has read this book can easily see that Valerie's parents fit this description quite accurately. Their actions (as well as others) are highly predictable, and don't give the reader a sense that we are going to be surprised by anything...and, unsurprisingly, we aren't. It all seems to play out like a typical melodrama. As for the denouement (or falling action), once we see or anticipate what the ending is going to be, the reader's patience begins to ebb when made to wait excessively. In this case, the final third of the book seems to go on forever. We know where Rachel is going to end up and now we have to wait for it, and wait for it, and wait for it... I truly appreciate the clash of cultures set up in this book, but the basic difficulty I find with LISTENING FOR LIONS is that my students (well-read eighth-graders) will find this to be predictable, uninspiring or not effectively engaging -- particularly in comparison to the dozens of other books that they will be reading this year. Sadly, this book has disappointed me because I don't see it as anything but a Young Adult novel. The best YA books I eagerly endorse and urge adults without kids to read (for example: AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS, SPEAK, CRISS CROSS, PETER AND THE STARCATCHERS, THE GOLDEN COMPASS, ONCE UPON A MARIGOLD, the original THE SECRET GARDEN).

The basic idea is that refined, high-carb foods cause weight gain, especially in the stomach. Even though nutrition experts insist you can't lose more weight in your stomach than elsewhere, I tried it and it works. Two years ago, I did Phase 2. I dropped a dress size and my stomach -- which always stuck out no matter how much weight I lost elsewhere -- is now flat. I've had no trouble continuing to eat this way and to maintain the weight loss. After all, it's super easy, since all you're doing is eating in a traditional manner. I eat a small amount of sugar every day -- and still no weight gain. The book is not without flaws. Phase 1 is an unnecessary and unhealthy crash diet, but it can be skipped. Also, you can probably safely eat any vegetable or fruit, except for potatoes, which raise blood sugar more than sugar does. (The author has since revised his stance against such vegetables as carrots, which have a low gylcemic load.) A really excellent aspect of this book is its emphasis on health, not just losing weight. The author stresses the importance of eating \"good\" fats, such as nuts, oils, avocados, fish, eggs, and mayonnaise, which are good for the heart and actually help counteract the effects of dangerous fats, such as partially hydrogenated oil. So many people have the misconception that all fats are bad, and they torture themselves with low-fat diets that are unhealthy -- and probably cause weight gain. The author also points out that partially hydrogenated oil is actually worse than lard, since it contains only bad fats and no good fats, and should not be eaten at all. He also recommends a moderate intake of saturated animal fats. He also recommends staying active -- just 20 or 30 minutes a day of walking is all you need. All in all, very reasonable advice and highly recommended. I look forward to the day when The South Beach Diet becomes orthodoxy and restaurants start serving whole grains and green leafy vegetables.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Great cookbook even if you aren't on the diet!!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am ordering a second copy of this book because I have worn out my first copy!

The recipes are delicious and the advice is dispensed with an irrepressible amount of common sense from Dr. Agatston.  The good doctor realizes that in our fast-moving world with jobs and commitments with children that we don't have the time to always eat right and fall into bad habits of eating at fast food places.  Agatston shows that you can eat right, and quickly and most of all eat smart with his diet plan.  Maybe I should have said most important is that the recipes are delicious and they surely are.  I've become a big fan of wraps for lunch at work.  You can make an endless variety of things with low carb and fat ingredients like turkey, chicken, and tuna and always have something a bit different. Like any good cookbook it provides chapters on Poultry, beef, seafood, vegetables, salads, soups, desserts, and more.  Agatson includes stories from those who have success on his plan throughout the book to serve as encouragement to those currently following it.  It really helps keep you focused by knowing how many people have benefited from the diet.  Even if you're not looking to lose a lot of weight, the South Beach Diet Cookbook is a practical way to eat healthy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Strong writing of 4 self-absorbed women learning to grow</td><td>4.0</td><td>When she opens a yarn and knitting shop on Blossom Street, cancer survivor Lydia Hoffman doesn't know what to expect. She has enough money to run the shop for a while, but will she bring in customers? Or is she simply wasting her time and creating a burden on her mother, as her sister hints? It doesn't take too long before Lydia's beginning knitting class starts up with three very different women. Jacqueline Donovan is a wealthy snob, contemptuous of her daughter-in-law and angry with her husband for having an affair. Alix Townsend is planning on working off the community service time she earned for having drugs in her purse (they belonged to her roommate). Carol Girard is obsessed with having a baby--no matter what the financial, emotional, or ethical costs. Despite their differences and initial conflict, the four women forge a bond, gradually growing together. At first, the women seem to share only two things--their knitting and an unhealthy self-obsession. By working together, each becomes free to break out from their self-imposed boundaries and to see how their self-destructive behavior was a choice rather than something imposed on them from the outside. Author Debbie Macomber specializes in strongly written stories of women coming together for support and growth. THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET is a strong entry into this category. Although all four women may initially put readers off, their growing strength as they finally face their problems and seize their power makes them sympathetic and even heroic. The love interests are possibly a bit too perfect, but this is a romance after all and who needs a romantic fantasy about a realistic male.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The South Beach Diet - RECOMMENDED!!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've tried countless diets, as I sure you have too, but this one REALLY worked for me! In the first two weeks I lost 10 lbs! This diet is so unique because its not just about losing weight but changing your lifestyle and focusing on a healthier you. I love this diet because it stresses not having to feel hungry and isn't complicated! This is the perfect diet for everyone, mainly because you do not have to deprive yourself! You'll enjoy normal size helpings of meat, poultry, and fish. You'll also eat eggs, cheese, nuts, and vegetables AND (my favorite part) - snacks are required! You'll learn to avoid the bad carbs, like white flour, white sugar, and baked potatoes. Best of all, as you loose weight, you'll loose that stubborn belly fat first! The intial two week period is the most restrictive part of the diet. This phase was hard for me because I am always craving bread, pasta and fruit but there are still choices and snacks. The second phase offers somewhat more choices, including whole wheat bread and other selected carbohydrates. Also, roughly half the book is comprised of complete meal plans along with simple recipes! I also love how the book is written - in a conversational tone and inviting manner that makes the book more appealing than many other diet tomes. From someone who was sick of counting calories and fad diets - the South Beach Diet was my answer and can be your too!

Last month, we decided to begin the South Beach Diet, and I purchased this book with the hope of finding simple, nutritious recipes. The South Beach Diet Quick and Easy cookbook provides simple, quick recipes with ingredients that are easy to find in a typical grocery store.  In the beginning of the book, Dr. Agatston provides the reader with a complete glossary of ingredients, a list of quick meal ideas, food safety tips, and a list of 10 essential kitchen tools.  The recipes are categorized into breakfast, soups, snacks, salads, seafood, poultry, meat, vegetarian, side dishes, and desserts.  Recipes are color-coded for Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the South Beach Diet. I wasn't sure what to expect, since I had heard the stereotypical complaints of health food being dry, boring, and tasteless.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The South Beach Diet Quick & Easy Cookbook provides wonderful recipes drawing from many different styles of cuisine, and has added some much-needed variety to our diet.  A few of our favorites are the Almond Energy Blast, Chicken and Mushroom Soup, Turkey Parmesan, Baked Pesto Chicken, and Grilled Ancho-Rubbed Flank Steak.  My husband has raved about many of the selections, indicating that they're some of the best dinners he's ever tried.  The tasty food we've been eating gives us great incentive to stick with this program.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>hi, my name is _____ and i'm a sugar addict.</td><td>5.0</td><td>i never realized how addicted to sugar and bread i was until i tried this diet. the first three to four days of phase 1, the most strict, i was miserable. i had HORRIBLE headached from the lack of sugar. i used to drink about 10 diet sodas a day....maybe have water once a month. after those first few days, i COULD NOT drink diet sodas anymore. they tasted like nasty syrup medicine....and they STILL do. so now, i drink nothing but water and sometimes some sugar free crystal light. bread is still my downfall so i just don't buy it anymore. i buy wheat bread because i hate it and the rest of my family is okay with it. i stayed on phase 1 for 2 weeks and lost ten pounds. on phase 2 i have maintained my weight even through my \"snack days\". this is by far, the easiest way that i have ever lost weight. i can actually see my toes because my belly fat really disappearred. i have gone down two dress sizes in two weeks. i have never tried atkins but my sister is on that diet currently and is having trouble losing weight on it. once you get used to the format of the book, it's not hard to follow at all although, it could have been put together a little better. i will follow the SBD for my entire lifetime as i have never felt lighter or healthier or HAPPIER. say HELLO to the new me!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>a classic piece of literature</td><td>5.0</td><td>there are some stories that drift through your conscious mind like white fluffy clouds. eventually, it's just another cumulus in a clear sky.. and you barely blink as it passes. american gods is a summer storm written into mature comedy about how life might actually be. as the story develops, it threatens, blows and rages, pours down, gives you bits of sunshine, leads you a merry dance, then twists back and surprises you. there are some rainbows. if you are looking for mundane and conventional, this novel is not for you. if you want an easy plot, a pre-determined by genre course or a happy ending, this story is not for you. if you want a twisted greek tragedy mixed in with viking lore and ugly american culture that symbolizes the complexity and unfairness of life, that jumps from here to there entwining the lives of several people and dubious characters who turn out to be the neighbor you thought you knew and didn't, then you might want to drift thru this book and get lost in the pages.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>American Gods</td><td>2.0</td><td>Sorry, not a book for me...

This fourth time through, after having read more of his other works and more of the afterwords he's put them, I realized that it really does read like him:  his milieu is \"fairy tales\" AND myth.  This book falls smack in the middle of myth.  Also, a lot of his work is dark, and this book is dark.  There does seem to be a slight difference in tone, though.  \"American Gods\" lacks almost all of the witticisms present in his other works and, somehow, it feels more \"real\" (probably because he invented only the characters and seems to have tried to keep the settings true(ish) to life).

His book, however, is rather dissapointing.  Not because he's a bad guy - quite the opposite.  He is so reserved in his criticism that the whole book comes off like some sort of \"Wonderful Life.\"  For example, when talking about Ricky Watters (a player who was obviously a major pain in the a**), he says merely \"For whatever reason, Ricky Watters never really seemed to warm up to me.\"  And his dodging around Al Davis is even worse - his summary of why he left the Raiders is simply \"My agent, Bob LaMonte, told me that negotiations for a contract extension were going nowhere.\"  That's it??? Great guy, great coach, but a dissapointing read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Not a Great Diet</td><td>1.0</td><td>One knows that there is a problem with this book by page 3, where the Phase One stage of The South Beach Diet - extremely low-carb - is said to produce a weight loss of 8-13 pounds in 2 weeks, but then there is never any estimate given of how fast or how much weight loss is possible after the first two weeks. Atkins followers know that the early weight loss on an extremely low-carb diet is mostly water loss. \"You'll eat three balanced meals a day...\" is a complete misrepresentation of the ultra low-carb Phase-One. Not that \"balanced meals\" - roughly equal calorie amounts of carb, fat and protein - were a good idea for many people anyway.  The strengths of this book are the admission that the low-fat diet of the American Heart Association and many other NGOs does not work (p8); that there are good and bad forms of LDL cholesterol (p33); that fruit juice with no fiber is worse for you than whole fruit (p46); that more cooking raises the glycemic index (GI) of many vegetables (p53); that fiber consumption will slow digestion of carbs, which is good (p64); and that the bread basket served in restaurants is a diet disaster because of the high GI carb content of the breads (p86). While he understands the value of low GI foods, he is blank on glycemic load, the amount of high GI carbs in a food.  The weaknesses are: Dr. Agatston claims not to have found literature support for a medium carb diet in the literature in the mid-1990s, showing an appalling inability to read the literature, including books by Richard K. Bernstein, MD, Barry Sears, PhD, John Yudkin, MD, and many others. He parrots the nonsense that high cholesterol is a major factor in heart disease (p7, p96) despite evidence from 1937 that it is not, nor is high LDL. See Uffe Ravnskov, MD, PhD, \"The Cholesterol Myths\", 2000. He misrepresents the Atkins Diet as low-fat (p10), and misrepresents most fruits, vegetables and whole grains as containing \"good carbs\" (p10 and many others places) despite the long-known fact that starches that turn to glucose and the fructose from fruits are not beneficial in large amounts. He claims that low-fat dairy products are not fattening (p11) despite their content of high-GI lactose without enough fat to slow its absorption. See Mary G. Enig, \"Know Your Fats\", 1999. He recommends polyunsaturated oils, especially the omega-6 ones (p22), which are definitely not healthful, and worsen heart disease. He slams saturated fats with no evidence whatever on their safety. In fact, a recent study showed that high saturated fat consumption reversed coronary artery blockage, while monounsaturated fat (olive oil) narrowed arteries slightly, and polyunsaturated fats (soybean oil) narrowed arteries seriously (Mozaffarian D et al., Am J Clin Nutr 2004;80:1175-84). He recommends balsamic vinegar (p29) despite its high sugar content. He claims that \"carbs are good for you\" despite evidence that there is no nutritional requirement for them at all in humans (Fred & Alice Ottoboni, PhDs, The Modern Nutritional Diseases, 2002). In dumping on beer (p50, p88), he is unaware of low-carb versions. He thinks apple skin has special benefits; there is no evidence given for this, and not eating it spares you all the pesticide content (p55). In pushing red wines (p56), he ignores the high sugar content of most of them, and is unaware that wine does little to reduce all-cause mortality. He does not emphasize that eating fat will slow digestion of carb much better than fiber (p64). His GI table (pp70-74) leaves out all the foods with low GI, such as meat, fish, fat, oil and nuts. He confuses the sugar content in beets with the lack of it in MSG made from beets (p88). He failed to warn of the dangers of extreme exercise (p92); see Henry Solomon, \"The Exercise Myth\", 1984. He fails to warn of dairy, grain and wheat allergies, and the relationship of these foods to arthritis and cancer (p92). He recommends a form of carb-loading before exercise (p93), contrary to the findings of Barry Sears, PhD (Enter the Zone, by Barry Sears, PhD, and Bill Lawren.  New York, NY:Regan/HarperCollins1995).  He lauds both statin drugs and aspirin despite their bad effect on women of higher mortality and their lack of benefit in men (Duane Graveline, MD, MPH, \"Lipitor Thief of Memory\", 2004). He neglects beneficial effects of vitamin C other than on heart attacks (p94). He mistakes the d-alpha-tocopherol as \"the natural form of  vitamin E\" despite clear research findings that vitamin E is a mixture of 8 compounds (p95). Despite his specialty of medical imaging, he fails to comprehend the findings that the extent of calcified plaque deposits in coronary arteries as found by electron beam tomography has no correlation whatever to serum cholesterol levels (Hecht HS et al., Am J Cardiol 2004;93:101-3).  Most evidence was testimonials, not controlled trials. There were no citations to peer-reviwed journals.  The South Beach Diet is not so great - Bill Clinton used it for years. Some of the most healthful fats are disparaged, and carbs of no value are touted. Grain and dairy allergies are almost ignored. The many recipes given in the book  are flawed for this reason. See Joel M. Kauffman, Low-Carbohydrate Diets, J. Scientific Exploration , 18(1), 83-134 (2004).</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Did not finish.

I say this as someone who looks at the World from a scientific point of view but tries to understand the totality of our living experience. Karen Armstrong's research has produced deeply perceptive writing on religious thinking that is relevant to both sides of the current debate. She does so from the remarkable position of a person who rejected a belief in God but still wanted to understand religion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Oh please how much money can you make from a book?</td><td>1.0</td><td>Next there will be South Beach Diet food or is there already?

Yes, Mr Gaiman has a vivid imagination, and one of his main premises--that the old world gods wither in America, as succeeding generations cease to worship them--is a brilliant concept. But in the course of writing a long book over several years, a lot of other thoughts and influences muddied the literary waters in which he was 'swimming.' It is indeed quite odd that the war between old and new gods is dismissed in a page or two, after much warning and foreboding; it is even stranger that the book concludes with solving a mystery that wasn't an especially prominent plot point. On the plus side, there is a vivid imagination at play here. I suppose the contract a reader makes with a writer is to go where he is taken, and it's a tad unfair to complain that you \"don't like the tangential stories\" (I, for one, did) or \"don't believe the protagonist's character\" -- I tend to agree, and yet, the characterization IS the writer's prerogative... All in all, there are passages of dizzying, phantasmagorical imagery contrasted by plodding, dull stretches and a few too many side roads to travel. So 3 stars seems fair. The call for more clarity and better editing seem warranted, too. Fans of Neil Gaiman are the most likely to be pleased, whereas newcomers to his work, such as myself, might wonder quite what all the fuss is about. Nevertheless, it's good to have a writer of fantasy/supernatural material reach and stretch for meaning and resonance. That he didn't quite there and wasn't too clear about the path is not a disgrace, just a mild disappointment.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Book Worth Reading Twice</td><td>5.0</td><td>It is important to take a moment and look at the books on our shelves and to give them a second read. With so many books and so little time, we can't possibly do this for all of our favorite books, but there are some classics and classics-in-the-making that deserve another reading. One such book is American Gods by Neil Gaiman. Before I start, I should mention that I dedicate this review to Wednesday. If you don't know what I'm taking about, it's time to visit your bookstore. Go now. This year is the tenth anniversary of the publication of American Gods. I can't tell you how many people I know who have been shocked by the fact that ten years have passed since Gaiman's novel first hit the shelves. What surprises me most about this book is that it feels as fresh and relevant today as it felt ten years ago. Likely, I'll be saying these same words ten years from now. I have no doubt that readers and scholars alike will be picking up American Gods in fifty or sixty years and using it as a stick in the sand by which to measure other books that were written in the early twentieth century, but only time will tell. In a nutshell, American Gods is one man's journey to rebuild his life after getting released from prison. Little does Shadow know that the gods have other plans for him, and little do they know that he has his own plans. American Gods is a beautifully told story that is gorgeously written. The characters are all strong, unique individuals. With each turn of the page, you feel like you are getting to know a live person replete with all of the human (and inhuman) flaws that come with wanting to hang onto whatever form of \"life\" they may be experiencing. This novel spreads out, telling a complex tale that spans a huge geographic area, a large number of people, and quite a bit of history and lore. However, as sprawling as American Gods may be, it maintains a cohesiveness that broadens and deepens the reading experience. When I first finished reading American Gods, I remember feeling like I had lost something important (innocence, perhaps), but I gained something of much greater value in return (wisdom, I hope). After rereading American Gods, I was left with the feeling that if there must be gods among us in this \"new\" world of ours, let them be writers who weave tales, tell stories, and keep us bound together in myth and fiction that helps us to better understand ourselves and our world. Neil Gaiman is a phenomenally brilliant writer and storyteller, especially when he turns his hand to these darker adult novels that dare you to think in unconventional ways and inspire you to imagine \"what if\" there were ancient and new gods among us? What would the world be like? Would we even know? Would we want to know? American Gods is one of those books that you will not forget. It is a book that will likely remain on your bookshelf for years to come. If it's on your shelf now, I urge you to open it and to give it another read. If you haven't yet had the opportunity to read American Gods, you are missing out on something special. It also bears mentioning that HBO is planning to produce American Gods as a multi-season series. More information on the development of the series is sure to be coming soon.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Lousy</td><td>2.0</td><td>Man, this book was pretty stupid.

He's tried to keep his head down, learning coin tricks and cell block aphorisms from his low-key cell mate.  And then the world he's been reaching out for shatters.  Summoned to the warden's office, Shadow learns that his wife has been killed in a car wreck and he will be released early to attend her funeral.  He subsequently learns that he has also lost his best friend, his prospects for a job, his illusions about his marriage and any reason to stay in an empty house in his little town. Shadow accepts an offer from Mr. Wednesday, seemingly encountered by chance on an airplane.  He will be Wednesday's chauffer, bodyguard and... something like a straight man.  As they travel through small-town America, Shadow--and the readers--figure out that his employer and those he meets with are more than quirky human beings.  They are gods created and sustained by human belief.  The gods now face a crisis.  As Americans forget about them, they begin to fade away.  Already too many are gone. Wednesday tries to do something about this crisis while Shadow plays a strange and increasingly central role in his plans.  We meet several gods and see signs of their waning influence in an America that has turned its attention to television, technology, and more modern diversions.  Guiman paints the gods large, with expansive personalities, diverse powers, and astonishingly short attention plans. The gods' need for human belief creates a fascinating world where nearly everything important happens behind the scenes.  The slow development of Shadow as a more engaged human being and perhaps something more, is a well-woven plot element.  As we follow him, we ponder mysteries in plain sight that others overlook.  Why are roadside tourist attractions places of mythic power?  What goes unexplained in the small places that draw back from the outside world?  There are answers. Neil Gaiman's story is imaginative, pleasant to read, and captures something of what seems definitively American to a transplanted British author.  It is recommended.  Appreciative readers may enjoy Shadow's further development in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Anansi-Boys/dp/B000FCKENQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Anansi Boys</a>.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The New Gods</td><td>4.0</td><td>\"When the Old Gods died, there Arose the New Gods\" - Jack \"The King\" Kirby Neil Gaiman's novel, \"American Gods,\" plays on an old idea which, as stated in Kirby's classic Comic 'The New Gods,' is about the old vs the new, evil vs good. Only what side is right, and which side is wrong? Gaiman's novel is extremely detailed and establishes powerful characters and powerful relationships. The main character, Shadow gets out of jail due to the sad words \"your wife is dead.\" He wanders out of the jail, after serving time for a botched bank robbery, and gets on a airplane where he meets, by chance, a man named Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday is a strange man, who knows more about Shadow than Shadow is comfortable with. After burying his wife, Shadow encounters Mr. Wednesday and a friend, who turns out to be a leprechaun, and is drafted into a war, called \"the storm.\" The storm is approaching, and it is a fight that is of utmost importance, a fight between the old gods of the old lands, and of the new gods of television, internet and cellular phones. The idea isn't terribly original, but it is told in a refreshingly interesting way, and Gaiman succeeds with flying colors. The characters and story are developed well, slowly becoming solid characters, slowly growing and building muscle atop a rather weak premise. Just about the only complaint I have is not really a complaint at all, but, around the middle things seemed to grind to a halt for a few pages, but it was quite literally the smallest of problems, and is therefore not really a problem. I enjoyed reading the book and truly enjoyed the author's style. I can't wait to read more by Mr. Gaiman. Well played Mr. Gaiman, well played.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Evocative, Nostalgic a wandering journey of a novel</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have only ever read two books by Neil Gaiman(please don't lynch me) and they have both been religiously themed, i.e., Good Omens and American Gods.  I can't for the life of me think why it's taken so long to getting around to this one. In my defence, while this 10th Anniversary Edition is a review copy, I do actually own another battered copy of its first iteration, unread, along with its spin-off sibling Anansi Boys- both languish on the TBR shelf. The story, for the uninitiated... ----------------------------------- After three years in prison, Shadow has done his time. But as the time until his release ticks away, he can feel a storm brewing. Two days before he gets out, his wife Laura dies in a mysterious car crash, in adulterous circumstances. Dazed, Shadow travels home, only to encounter the bizarre Mr Wednesday claiming to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America. Together they embark on a very strange journey across the States, along the way solving the murders which have occurred every winter in one small American town. But the storm is about to break... Disturbing, gripping and profoundly strange, Gaiman's epic new novel sees him on the road to the heart of America. [Headline Books] So how can one give a review of a book that is beloved of so many, which has been read and reviewed over the last decade and still be fresh. I'll try. Gaiman weaves a number of threads together in this work.  It's a story about gods, travel murder, change,  gah! the more I pick at it the more things it seems to be.  So to begin I'll break it down. Neil Gaiman meets Route 66 -------------------------------- American Gods felt very much like a road trip, despite the fact that a significant portion of the travel in the book was by plane.  Perhaps it's mention of certain American landmarks and iconic places .  Maybe the stereotypes that the gods inhabit, hark back to an older America.  I feel the weight of nostalgia, for things lost in a vast open landscape. That Gaiman can generate this feeling in me I think speaks for the strength of his prose, as in retrospect, there's not actually that much travel. Everyone comes to America, even the gods. -------------------------------------------- Aiding this perception is the fact that it's an immigrant tale as well. A tale of the tired, the poor, the huddled masses and the gods they carried with them. Many of the gods bear the accents and the mannerisms of the culture they spring from and in Shadow traveling to meet them, the reader is given a sense of the cultural diversity that is the melting pot of America, the gods journey there and their slow strung out demise. Yggdrasil versus the Matrix ---------------------------- Entwined with these themes is that of change, old gods versus new - the gods of internet, credit cards and fibre optics. Is this is a comment on what America has become, a land of the almighty dollar, the land of the instant gratification? I am not sure. The Missing God One thing that did strike me as odd was the omission of Jesus.  If any god would be in America you'd think it would be Jesus, but he's conspicuous in his absence, apparently he's in Afghanistan.  Did Gaiman do this deliberately?  He mentions Jesus in the twitter interview printed in the back of this version, but it doesn't answer the question of Jesus' absence or apparent aloofness. Was he playing it safe? Murder Mystery & Confidence Tricks ----------------------------------- There's a murder mystery entwined in the story as well, but the less said about that the better as it's a nice little twist. There's coin tricks and confidence tricks through out the novel, magic and misdirection. Gaiman uses it both as plot device and on a meta level(this should hit you at the end, or before, if you are sharper than me). There's something about old time confidence tricks that harks back to a bygone America, face to face cons that required an understanding of human psychology. Summing up ------------------ This is the authors preferred text, it's a little longer and obviously varies from the first itteration. It includes a twitter interview, as well as a novella featuring Shadow called Monarch of the Glen.  I doubt that I would go back and read the first edition, it's not a tale that I think, given my present reading load, that would be of any benefit and this is after all  Gaiman's preferred story. For Gaiman fans that haven't read this version, it would be worth it if you haven't read the tale in awhile.  American Gods is not one of those pacey pot boilers you read in an afternoon.  It's a book to be savoured and enjoyed, it's a book that requires attention. For some one who is new to Gaiman I'd recommend this version.  It's not as I have said, a pacey read, but an unfolding journey of discovery with a couple of twists that I and perhaps you won't see coming.

I have to say, they are right up my chick flick sweet romance hearts and stars alley. Yet I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would.  This was actually more of a 2.5 for me. The funny thing is that I liked the storyline and I liked the characters, which leads me to believe I didn't like the writing. I find that shocking since Macomber is such a well respected/known author. I felt like she had a checklist of things she wanted the reader to learn about each character's past and another checklist of things she wanted to happen to the characters and that's how she wrote this book. Short, choppy sentences that were more like a list than a story. Since I don't know if the writing style had more to do with the story she was telling or if it's her usual style, I will give her books another chance. The conundrum is that I don't like dropping a series so I would like to read the next book in this series, but that may not give me the info regarding the author's style that I'm looking for. I'll have to think on this...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Spiral Staircase</td><td>4.0</td><td>I recommended this for our Book Club because I had heard her speak several times at Chautauqua, NY.

The book is filled with \"And then something happened\" \"What was that?\" \"It was the background\" and you have to pick one of the infinite numbers of things that could have happened. What gets me about people who read this guy's books, is that they all think he writes awesome stories, but if you sit them down and say \"Ok, what happened in the scene with the spider?\" you'd probably get a thousand different responses, and none of them would be wrong, because Gaiman didn't actually explain what happened, how they traveled, why, where, what, how they got there. You can draw with crayons and make things up with more detail. Now, aside from that, his grammar, ability to describe random items that mean nothing (Cigarette box, nipple), is actually interesting. Unlike other fiction writers, he only spends a paragraph or 2 doing that, whereas I'm used to having to read 2 pages. I suppose if Mr. Gaiman could describe anything regarding the storyline, he'd probably be one of my favorite authors. Definitely a great writer, but I'm capable of lateral thinking, and if you're capable of thinking, this book is going to be very confusing. This is like reading one of those questions where the right answer is \"Not enough information.\" To everything. If you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about. If you don't know what I'm talking about, your brain filled in something that wasn't actually in the book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Shameful</td><td>1.0</td><td>There were books written about Japan in 1891 that were better than this book was in 1991. There is no reason to read this book. I'll just give a brief example here. Chapter 9 is supposed to be about homeroom activities, but it opens by confounding the reader with pages of nonsense on the meaning of classrooms in Japan: \"In every school across the country, students are assigned to a homeroom class, or kumi. The word kumi, which is rooted in the Japanese character for thread, was first used several hundred years ago to describe bands of samurai warriors attached to a feudal lord... The importance of the kumi as an educational tool, however, goes beyond this good-natured team spirit. The classroom that the students inhabited had been, in effect, leased to them by the school, in an arrangement not unlike the way a feudal lord lent land to a group of serfs.\" Later, talking about kumi, he writes: \"No one [had warned] me that the country still suffers from the legacy of a four-hundred-year-old feudal class system that was officially outlawed over a century ago.\" This is pure fantasy. The word kumi is the Japanese word for \"form\", as in \"fifth form, third year\". All British schools use this system. Japan adopted it from the British and translated the vocabulary. The second sentence I quoted is not even justifiable by strained etymology but is purely an invention of the author's wild imagination, and the third is his bizarre and wrong conclusion. The entire book smacks of this sort of Orientalism. He even drops the wabi-sabi bomb. Don't read it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Mystic River is a Crime Writers Masterpiece!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I read this novel when Dennis Lehane wrote it, and I was amazed at the gracefulness with which the story developed. I felt deeply for and cared for these characters, flawed and imperfect though they were, they were human, and the author presented them singularly, yet in tandem, as their lives ricocheted against each other in tragic ways. I shall not review the plot nor outline the story because it has been covered most succinctly in multiple reviews. I do wish to quote James Lee Burke, another excellent crime writer. As the guest author in The Week magazine in the January 12, 2018 edition, and invited to choose and review his six favorite novels, Mr. Burkes words about Mystic River were:  I believe this to be the best crime novel in the English language. The talent and craft in this fine novel are head-reeling. Many of the paragraphs are sonnets, and the characters, both good and evil, are among the best and most intriguing in American literature.

In nearly every chapter, I found myself laughing out loud. As the book progressed, however, I became disturbed by the author's general exclusion of personal reflections on his experiences. For example, it remains ambiguous whether the author is interested in trying \"nanpa\"--a procedure in which strangers \"pick up\" on women in bars, discos, or similar environments, mostly popular among young Japanese men--out of a genuine desire to procure a Japanese girlfriend, or merely in demonstration of a detached cultural curiosity. He interjects almost no explicit discussions of his feelings or emotional reactions toward the many shocking, challenging, and even tragic events that he encounters throughout the narrative. As someone interested in going to Japan to teach English, and curious about the types of experiences had by Americans who have done so in the past, this particular quality of Feiler's narrative was a bit disappointing. By the end of the book, however, I came to the realization that the very inclusion of certain information in Feiler's memoir speaks volumes on the nature of the clash between Western and Japanese culture. The details that Feiler includes on the overbearingly autocratic leadership style of his school principle, the structure of a seventh-grade fieldtrip to Disneyland Tokyo, and the reaction of Japanese students toward his unorthodoxly American pedagogical style all attest to the impression that Feiler was deeply moved and challenged by his interactions with Eastern culture. And the laughter and tears that several of his anecdotes drew forth compel me to conclude that these passages were not written without emotional affectation. In my preparation to move overseas to teach and live among an unfamiliar society, I found this book deeply enlightening and encouraging. As previous experiences abroad have taught me, being a foreigner in a new country can be a direly lonely and often stressful experience. Feiler has given us an insightful and meaningful account of what Americans moving to Japan ought to expect from the culture clash, as well as detailed many interesting aspects of Japanese society that outsiders interested in the country might not otherwise consider. I highly recommend it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>American Godsdamn it...</td><td>2.0</td><td>Wasted a few hours of my life reading this. Things you have to know before buying this book. 1) The main characters name is \"Shadow.\"  Seriously.  He tells people his name is \"Shadow\" and nobody bats an eyelash.  I kept waiting for someone to do a spit-take but it never happens.  His name is Shadow.  Oh, and his wife nicknames him \"Puppy.\"  So if you can stomach your main character being addressed alternatingly as either \"Shadow\" or \"Puppy\" you're in good shape. 2) The \"Gods\" referred to in the book are the lameset bunch of sad-sacks you will ever read about.  They are mortal (in the sense they can be killed with a gun or run over by a car) although they don't age and they look like normal people (some are tall, some are pretty, some are old, some are young).  So what makes them Gods you ask?  Well, they are good at coin-tricks and some of them can hypnotize people.  That's it.  Seriously.  Odin, the father of all Greek Gods has the amazing powers of being able to hypnotize girls into sleeping with him and passing bad checks.  No joke.  That's it.  Why anyone would have ever prayed to these \"Gods\" in the first place God only knows (pun intended).  They are so lame and boring, it's really terrible. 3) You seriously will not care about a sinle character in this book.  I didn't care if the main character lived or died.  I just wanted SOMEONE to do SOMETHING interesting.  Never happens.  Although towards the end things get really retarded and \"Shadow\" gets tied to a tree and dies?  But then starts riding a giant bird around? But it might have been a dream?  Who knows. 4) Ahh who cares.  I've already wasted too much time reading the thing, why waste more writing about it?

The new gods are as quickly taken up as they are abandoned, cast aside for the next big thing. Either you've been forgotten, or you're scared you're going to be rendered obsolete, or maybe you're just getting tired of existing on the whims of people. Shadow, just out of prison and with nothing to go home to, is hired to be Mr. Wednesday's bodyguard as he travels around America to warn all the other incarnations of gods, legends, and myths, that \"a storm is coming.\" There's going to be a battle between the old gods who were brought to melting pot America by their faithful followers generations ago, and the new gods of technology, convenience, and individuality. That's the premise of Neil Gaiman's American Gods and it's just crackling with promise! But unfortunately, that's not really what this novel is about. It's what the novel keeps telling us it's about (and what many critics told us it was about), but it doesn't deliver. Yes, there are plenty of gods, myths, and legends, and Gaiman does great things with some of them (e.g., Ibis the undertaker and Mr. Nancy) but most are never developed and a reader who has not read an encyclopedia of folklore probably won't catch all the clever allusions. Yes, there's Neil Gaiman's characteristic style, which I always enjoy. His prose is clean, unvarnished, and exquisite. His characters are recognizable; His America is recognizable. In fact, this was the best part of the book (and what Gaiman does so well) -- Shadow's roadtrip across the United States gave Gaiman plenty of opportunities to showcase his humorous insights into the human condition and, in this case, small-town American life. This was lovely, and I enjoyed these parts of the book. The problem with American Gods was that the plot, meandering this way and that across the continent, never solidified. Shadow goes to this American town, meets a few gods and legends, goes to this other place, meets a couple more... There are numerous short stories detailing the lives of these gods and the people who worshipped them, so we expect to see some of these folks again (perhaps at this coming battle), but we don't. A few weird mystical things happen to Shadow and we anticipate an explanation for those occurrences. Then there's a sub-plot involving Shadow's undead wife who asks Shadow to bring her back to life. I don't want to ruin it for anybody, but let me say that the \"storm\" we're promised doesn't materialize. Every time there's a conflict, or a tight spot, someone suddenly shows up and, knowingly or unknowingly, takes care of it. Shadow (and his dead wife) figure out what the bad guys are going to do before they do it. Characters who we hoped might play a bigger role, and events that seemed to be significant, just fade away. The whole thing kind of fizzles. The plot twists at the end aren't clever or inventive -- they just seem to be there to fit the role of \"obligatory plot twist.\" The premise of American Gods has so much promise. I was anticipating some poignant social commentary on America and our habits of worship. After all, American Gods is a best-selling award-winning novel and I expect great things from Neil Gaiman. But it didn't happen this time and I really can't explain the critical acclaim for this novel.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>\"Learning\" is the key idea in this nice memoir</td><td>5.0</td><td>Bruce Feiler spent a year teaching English in a Japanese junior high school in Tochigi prefecture. His book contains both his observations on the Japanese school system and his own experiences as an American living in Japan for the first time. He also takes time to explain unfamiliar aspects of the culture, from Shinto religious practices to the evolution of the Japanese school lunch. This is a very appealing introduction to Japan from a young man who admires many aspects of Japanese culture but does not hesitate to criticize other aspects. There are some wonderful set pieces, such as his introduction to an onsen (hot spring) communal bath, his stay in a hospital, and his climb of Mt. Fuji. Feiler was in Japan in the late 80's, so some of his observations are, of course, dated, but that's hardly a good reason not to read this fine book. How could a memoir not be \"dated\" in the sense that it conveys a particular time and place? Feiler's strength as a writer is the blend of sharp observation and humor (including the self-deprecating kind) that he brings to his book. He depicts very well the sort of \"lost in translation\" moments that any traveler to Japan (or any other unfamiliar place) is bound to have. A further plus is the way he avoids the hushed, reverential tone found in some other accounts by travelers to Japan. This is a particularly useful book if you are planning a trip to Japan yourself.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Better than Atkins but read Atkins too!</td><td>4.0</td><td>I started out on the Atkins diet, not South Beach.  I was happy with the results (I lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks), although I seem to have hit a point where I can't lose anymore.  But this might be because I only had a total of 20 pounds to lose and I'm convinced that those last 10 pounds are only going to come off with frequent trips to the gym.  Anyway, after hearing about the South Beach Diet and its similarities, I decided to read the book and see what I thought compared to Atkins.  I have to say, I think the SBD plan makes more sense than Atkins because of the separation of \"good fat\" from \"bad fat\".  Later in the diet, it also allows you to have complex carbs from whole grain bread, fruit, and fiber-loaded cereal, which Atkins doesn't (and which I've been missing!).  One of the problems I had with Atkins is that his book never really justified why it was ok to eat so much saturated fat and never suggested that mono- or poly-unsaturated fats should be your main fat source, which the SBD does.  Although I like the ideas in the SBD better, the book is lacking in scientific background compared to Atkins New Diet Revolution.  If you REALLY want to know the medical background on lipolysis, ketosis, hyperinsulinism, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, READ THE ATKINS BOOK FIRST (but read \"New Diet Revolution\", not \"Atkins for Life\").  I found it very useful to already know a lot of the medical background on topics that Agatston only briefly goes over.  So, overall I'd say that the SBD is a quicker, easier, but less-informative read (only about 100 pages if you don't include the recipes), and that the diet itself, although based on the same principles as Atkins, is probably safer in the long run than Atkins because of the \"good fat\"/\"bad fat\" separation.  I would suggest that everyone read Atkins first, then read South Beach and DO the South Beach Diet.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Low carb but not no carb</td><td>5.0</td><td>Ok, if you are sick of eating dozens of eggs and the greasy feel of cream is getting to you?

The \"South Beach\" diet is a modification of a low-carb diet with the twist of \"good fats\" and \"bad fats.\" Good fats in this case are oils like olive and NOT butter fat. And not all carbs are bad--high fiber wheat breads come back into the picture far sooner than on the Atkins diet. For those bored with no-carb diets, this is a real boon. Relatives of mine report significant weight loss; the jury is out with me. But to be able to eat some carbs in moderation would indeed be nice. Any diet that limits one food group to extreme is difficult to maintain for a long haul.

I actually had to go back and listen to it a second time immediately after finishing it thinking I surely had missed something...some point...anything...and this is what I finally came up with: In my opinion, this book actually starts at the end with Vonnegut himself sitting in a dark corner of a cocktail lounge in a run down, failing little town watching the world go by for many of the resident of the lowly little town on the brink of financial collapse.  As he chases an anti-depressant with a Black and White, his depression and imagination slip somewhere close to madness and the story begins to develop along with some interesting and challenging characters.  As he begins to create the back stories of these characters, I can imagine him pondering what would happen if Kilgore Trout were to come face to face with these folks...what conflict would come of the meeting between Dwayne ( who is slowly going insane) and Trout?  So, he has Trout take a road trip bringing him to a proposed art festival and the final encounter is explosive.  KV inserts himself into the tale at the end, meets KT and tells him he's sorry for all the pain he's created for KT over the years, promises him a more bright future going forward and then \"fade to black\". Now, this may sound like a really good story and I think it could have been but the story is told in so many fragmented bits and pieces of back stories, descriptions of drawings from the paper version, self reflection, personal view points, \"and so on...\" that it is difficult to follow along between about chapter 3 or 4 until the final chapter.  Adding to my struggle, I found the reading of the audio version to be very droll and monotone...which I am almost certain would have made KV very happy.  It is a fitting tone for someone on the edge of madness whose mind would be wandering but, as a listener, I found my own mind wandering to doing laundry, remembering an item I forgot to pick up at the market, planning for next years income taxes. \"ETC.\".  I actually had to listen to the same chapters 6 or more times because I realized I had faded off somewhere and completely missed most of it. By the time I got to the final chapter and epilogue, I was somewhat back into the book again (on the second go round) and found some personal meaning to the book.  For a brief moment, I contemplated listening to it a third time to see if coming up with what I believed to be the soul of the story would help me to digest the book better but I just couldn't imagine going through it a third time...not now, maybe some day...so it will sit on a shelf until I have a mind to give it another shot.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>It makes sense, but.....</td><td>3.0</td><td>I bought the book and desperately wanted to do the South Beach Diet.

One obvious advantage in Bruce's camp was the fact that he already spoke Japanese and had previously lived in Japan, easing his transition. Although the portrait of Japanese society is somewhat dated (late '80s, much has transpired since then with the Japanese economy), his portrayal of a country at odds with its unique culture versus globalization, of the schools serving as parents and educators combined, and of the group, rather than the individual, as a unit captures the Japanese spirit.

The old pantheon is quite well delineated. The new group of gods are victims of poor profiling. This is one of the few books in the genre which does not make strong distinctions between good and evil. i am reminded of Miyazaki animations where an evil character can do good things and vice versa. Humans are petty, and so are gods. But both exist and are in harmony without any proselyting. Neither group takes the other very seriously. maybe all religion including atheism should be like this. I wish Richard Dawkins would read this book, and then other and earlier science fiction, although the thread is not easily self-evident. Although the style is stiffling and rather inadequate, the story line is strong and carries you through to the end quite quickly and without skipping. The huge amount of physical discomfort due to the weather, the geography, the structures, the vehicles and the lack of sufficient clothing reduces the ease of empathy. I could only identify with my friends of many years, the old gods. As for the new ones of Mr. Gaiman, the ones i struggle with in my mundane life are much better defined. It is neither dark enough nor comical enough to be called 'dark comedy'. It really is no \"Barton Fink.\" I also found it somewhat too American. For someone who is not very familiar with American life and culture, the book will be definitely less enjoyable, and would get fewer stars from a global perspective. Also, it is definitely not for the 'monster hunter' or 'good monster/bad monster' readers.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Finally A Diet I Can Live With</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have been a yo-yo dieter all of my life.

She suffers the inevitable loss of faith that traumatizes bright young people but significantly without proper guidance, so leaves the order and continues the search through literature and teaching. Meanwhile her physical well being deteriorates as she discovers she is epileptic and again this occurs without proper assistance from the community much to the chagrin of the doctor that finally recognizes that she has long had all the symptoms. Her career and interest lead her into a series of TV specials along with books to accompany them where she dives into religious scholarship to support her programs. This eventually leads to her publishing her bestseller \"A History of God\" where she applies her accumulated research to support tolerance and respect among the religions of the book. Hyam Maccoby she explains was a great influence. Her spiritual ascent leaves off at the end of the book with a more abstract concept of the divine and a pragmatic sense of the power of those religions to take a person out of themselves and feel compassion for others. This she concludes is the main function of religion and those fundamentalist sects that promote themselves as against other sects do just the opposite of what religion is supposed to do.  I found it a very enjoyable read since at some points of her experience I either could remember something similar in mine or those I have observed. Fortunately for me I had plenty of guidance thanks to a faculty that knew what they were doing! It must also be a significant help not having poor health as well.

We read the different low carb books and I decided, with her help, to try the South Beach Diet because it includes moderate fruits. She agreed I should try it, perhaps she had grown embarrassed because I was so heavy given her profession. Week 4. In the first phase, which I had been on for 3 weeks, I have dropped 6% of my total body weight. I seem to have leveled off for the last week as I have begun to add more things back. This is what the book predicts. I had a BMI of 32.5 and now have a BMI of 30.6. I will go back into the strict phase soon to push that even lower. I am targeting less than 25. I include 30 min of exercise per day. The best news is that at no time have I felt deprived. Week 10. I now have been in the maintenance mode for some time with a few meals where I had fries or bread that are not included in the diet. My BMI is now 29.7 which is .9 less than the 4 week reading. I am still exercising and feel great. I still do not feel deprived. A significant item in the book is the suggestion to add a sugar-free fiber supplement. I highly recommend this as well. It has made this diet very tolerable, plus adds to my satiety. My wife is now a quiet, but enthusiastic believer in this type of approach.

It describes the (unfortunately) fast disappearing cooking of the old and less affluent days. I see this as the equivalent of English \"Soul-Food\".  Hard times force creativity! Prior to modern times, people used the whole beast, all parts of available vegetables, throwing away the minimum.  Slow cooking, coaxing flavours and the \"terroir\" from the ingredients.  Maybe the terrible reputation English food had came from the American troops turning up in England from 1942 onwards.  England had been under siege for years at that point, importing only fuel and munitions and other essentials, forcing people to eat local traditional foods.  Sheep that were no good for wool any longer were eaten, chicken that didn't lay, were \"retired\" and eaten. All of the cabbage was cooked, including the tough outer leaves. So old, strong flavoured mutton, stewed cabbage, rabbit, pidgeon - gamey foods were a shocking contrast to the abundant great foods in the USA. The English needed to recall the historical roots of their cooking.  I like to think \"The Whole Beast\", brings them back with some modern and international twists. Lovingly and enigmatically. Fergus Henderson has written and listed a fascinating collection of recipes and interestingly in a strange and quixotic tone. Deciphering the text and his meaning is fun.  It makes one think and search more deeply for the character of the dish, more successfully than simply listing out steps in a recipe.

A homely introvert, Armstrong mistook her insecurities and immature idealism for a religious calling, ran to the Church looking for the security of acceptance, quickly became disillusioned and suffered a nervous breakdown. All though the Church educated her, was patient with her doubts and accepted her to leaving, she remains to this day antagonistic to the Christian religion. Her bias and resentments to Christianity, has somehow weirdly led her to become one of the foremost academic apologists for Islam. In her work (e.g. A HISTORY OF GOD), Armstrong has always seemed unable to maintain any objectivity for Christianity and resorts to absurdly obvious double-standards wherever Islam is concerned. An overrated, under-credentialed pop scholar, Karen Armstrong needs to grow up and accept reality. Armstrong merely left the shelter of the convent for that of the university. Both hold back the harsh demands of the realities of this world. This is the true dilemma of a Karen Armstrong and all of those thousands of academics just like her. I suggest Karen Armstrong develop the courage and honesty to take a long, extended trip to the Middle East and Africa. Following this, a job working with Catholic charities should also help.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>I can't believe Gaiman wrote this boring garbage</td><td>1.0</td><td>I have been a big fan of Gaiman.

Good Omens was fairly good, but American Gods, this book is horribly painfully boring. I am dumb struck that with over seven hundred ratings it averages 4 stars.  Not only is the book boring, it's filled with cheap sexual content that does very little to enhance the story. I'm no prune, but having Gaiman describe the taste of a man's semen in another man's mouth, yea I could have done without that description and visual, Thanks. Still that's not why I rate this book so badly, the story just goes no where, you get endless descriptions of towns, and signs, and what the main protagonist is eating, how crappy and cold the weather is, and who they meet in each town. The main characters Shadow and Wednesday are boring, dull and lifeless. I made it to page 200 out of 460, and gave up (a first for me). I kept reading thinking it's got to get better, if the author wasn't Gaiman I would have given up at a hundred pages. If you're new to Gaiman don't start with this book, start with Neverwhere. It is so much better that I can't believe the same man wrote both books.

You go into the story having an idea that things will be resolved in one way or another. And they are. There are some ups and downs, and I think that there could have been more information on the character interactions than there were, but I'm hoping that happens in her next books. It was more like a story of 4 people's lives that happen separately, and happen to cross at certain points. I suppose this is more realistic at this point in their meeting than to have them totally involved with each other. In any case, it was fun to read. I did have one HUGE problem with the author's writing style. She has the tendency to remind you every other time she mentions someone exactly who they are in relationship to everyone else (every time she mentions a maid's name, she points out that this is the maid). I find it almost insulting, as though as a reader I can't be expected to remember who the sister, the boyfriend, his son, etc. are from one section to the next. It was still a fun book to read, pure entertainment. Don't expect anything deep to come out of it, but it's great for when you just want to read about someone else's lives for a while.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A fun little book with the right amount of scary</td><td>5.0</td><td>Why is Measle Stubbs so afraid of his guardian, Basil Tramplebone? Is it his slithering, hissing way? Might it be those pointed, yellow teeth? Probably most ten-year-old boys would not be happy living in the shadow of the strange and frightening Basil. But Measle has no choice, as he is an orphan and must now live miserably in his guardian's dark, cold house. The one nice thing is the room at the top of the house that contains a most marvelous train set. Sometimes, when Basil is working on the train, he allows Measle to watch. But despite these moments of happiness, Measle is terribly nervous about something that lurks overhead and seems to be watching his every move. Measle's real adventure begins when he dares to play with Basil's train and is caught. The mad wizard, or \"Wrathmonk,\" quickly shrinks Measle to the size of one of the little village people. It doesn't take long for the clever Measle to figure out that Basil has been doing some really evil spells and that many of the \"villagers\" are real people turned into plastic. He accidentally discovers that, by feeding them carrot bits, they can become real again. Becoming real helps them all realize that perhaps together they can escape from Basil's horrible spell. However, in order to do this, they must come up with intelligent plans and face some formidable adventures. By far the most fun comes when they reverse one of Wrathmonk's spells and turn him into a giant cockroach! This is a fun little book with just the right amount of scary. Like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, it will be an especially popular selection for grades 4 through 6.

Having read all of her other books with the exception of her autobiographies, I envisioned a solid academic, with cadres of graduate students pulling together masses of data for her review.  No -- Armstrong is a theological autodidact!  Her personal religious and spiritual journey has, to paraphrase one of her favorites, T. S. Eliot, said, led her to where she started only to know it for the first time.  The God she ran from as a young adult has come to greet her in a very different form -- but I'll leave the specifics of this reverse quest for you to discover for yourself. Where her earlier work was clever and provocative, Armstrong has matured into one of the most thoughtful liberal religious writers of our day. She recognizes that the world cannot be healed without dialogue, and that you cannot have dialogue without running the risk that YOU may be changed.  \"It is not enough to understand other people's beliefs, rituals, and ethical practices intellectually,\" Armstrong says.  \"You have to feel them too and make an imaginative, though disciplined, identification.\" (p. 290. As one might expect from the breadth of her writings, Armstrong draws from the wells of myriad religious traditions, identifying what this reviewer believes to be the enduring truth, the thread that unities all genuine religious searching.  She learns from her own varied experiences, grows from adversity (e.g. a failed PhD thesis; years of undiagnosed epilepsy; and, of course, her much-noted years as a Catholic religious) and confronts both herself and her culture with unfailing honesty. Although Armstrong is far from the end of her journey (one hopes), she has adopted a theology of orthopraxy, which draws her into authentic living, honoring and accepting both weaknesses and strengths.  Armstrong attempts to ground her life in the conviction that \"compassion is a habit of mind that is transforming. . . You have to be prepared to extend your compassionate interests where there is no hope of a return.\"  This reviewer is particularly delighted by her conclusion, based on her exhaustive research of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, that \"fundamentalist movements distort the tradition they are trying to defend by emphasizing the belligerent elements in their tradition and overlooking the insistent and crucial demand for compassion.\" (p. 295) These points and many others, emerge in the theological commentary that forms the final chapter in this book.  This chapter alone could form the basis for several month's active discussion. If you read no other spiritual or religious work this year -- make it this chapter.  But be warned -- Armstrong's honest exploration can be dangerous to your complacency!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>good read</td><td>4.0</td><td>I enjoyed this book thoroughly with one problem, the repetition at the beginning of chapters - I was so engrossed in the characters I already knew about them and didn't need a recap!

Good, but not great; recommended</td><td>4.0</td><td>Shadow is a convict, surviving the final weeks of his sentence and looking forward to a return to his life and to his marriage, when he is told of his wife's death and is released early to attend her funeral. On the flight home, he meets a man named Mr. Wednesday that seems to know more about Shadow than he has any right to do. He offers Shadow a job: to protect Wednesday and work as his right hand man in the big storm that is brewing. When he accept the offer, Shadow is swept into a slice of American life that he never knew existed: a battle between the old gods, brought to America by early immigrants and now dying of neglect, and the new gods of TV, strip malls, and modern America that have been born on American soil and are steadily gaining power. In the course of the novel, the characters journey from cities to roadside attractions to small town to Indian reserves, and Gaiman explores the power in both folk life in America. The novel is as enduringly off-kilter as the roadside attractions Shadow visits, with Gaiman's edge of magic and darkness that give it gravity and purpose. The resolution to the battle between the American gods is too brief, and I don't find the premise quite as interesting as some of his other novels, but the book is an engrossing read, well written, and complex, carrying through a number of characters and concepts, as I expect from this author. I do recommend it. Ever since by surprisingly good experience with Neverwhere, I've been itching to read the rest of Gaiman's novels. American Gods was the first novel in that quest. Despite the fact that Gaiman writes in no particular genre, his work is always distinctly and recognizably his own. They investigate the supernatural within the normal, often in the form of a magical social structure that runs underneath to its mundane equivalent. In this vein, American Gods explores the supernatural world of the gods that populate American soil, arising from human inhabitants, including natives, immigrants, and citizens, but exist largely underneath daily life: in shadows, hidden out of the way, and/or wearing masks to allow them to exist undetected. Because the characters are by their nature explorations into the depths, the novel has an innate level of complexity. However, because the complexity is innate, the author isn't pushed to make the text deeper or to investigate more. As a result, the ideas are brilliant and reading the book is like discovering a new, hidden culture that exists below and adds depth to one's own, but the content of the novel lacks independent complexity, both in concept and in character. The text is interesting, unique, and original, but it lacks the total depth that I look for in what I would deem \"literature\". In other words: it's a good book, not a great one. (I also didn't enjoy the hidden world in American Gods as much as the hidden worlds of London Below and Fairie from Gaiman's other books, but I consider my own dislike for Americana a matter of personal taste.) For all of that, the plot of this novel is pleasantly complex, working at both a personal, local, and cosmic level in a few interconnected narratives. The plot lines fit together almost seamlessly and the stoyline is generally linear, so the narration isn't as complex (or as difficult) as the first few chapters sometimes make it seem. The resolutions come a bit quickly, especially in the cosmic plot (the war between the new and old gods), and the hasty conclusion, as well as the nature of the conclusion, makes the plot up until that point fall flat--not completely, but to the point where it is noticeable. It isn't a huge issue and doesn't destroy that plotline. Nonetheless, it was my biggest disappointment in the book because on the whole the other aspects--from characterization to the other plotlines--are strong. The number of concurrent stories keeps the book running at a good pace and the reader consistently interested as well as making for a text that takes more into account and so achieves a greater depth. The otherworldy aspects of the book are, as always in Gaiman, walk the line between fanciful and disturbing, and are all the more interesting as a result. The darker, more dangerous, sometimes sinister cast to the unnatural elements gives the book gravity and keeps it out of the realm of light, dismissible fantasy. Shadow as protagonist, however, sometimes detracts from the supernatural aspects: he accepts the strange occurrences too readily (a necessary aspect for the smooth progression of the plot, if somewhat unrealistic) and so, through his role as emissary between novel and reader, makes them seem too ordinary to the reader as well. On the whole, I recommend this book, both for Gaiman's unique otherworldy writing and for the unique and intelligent plot, but it didn't sweep me away in the way that some of the author's other work has. It's a good read, but not great literature, nor my favorite Gaiman novel.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Friendships Among the Yarns and Knitting Needles!</td><td>4.0</td><td>With a renewed interest in knitting on my part, and having enjoyed several books by Debbie Macomber in the past, I recently read and enjoyed The Shop on Blossom Street.

The Shop on Blossom Street books tells the story of a young woman and cancer survivor who opens a knitting store.  Offering knitting classes to attract customers, three women come to the shop to learn how to make a baby blanket.  But these three women couldn't be more different or come to the classes for different reasons which don't necessarily include learning how to knit.  And we as readers watch as these three women learn the stitches, watch their baby blankets take shape, and find themselves learning more about each other, helping each other with their projects and influencing each other's lives.  By the end of the book we find them forming lasting friendships and we know we won't soon forget these knitters. Similar to the premise of Debbie Macomber's book, Thursdays at Eight which I really enjoyed, The Shop on Blossom Street while  somehwat perdictable was a good journey and satisfying destination.

Younger teens will find these pieces easy to read and relate to. Hopefully, many will be intrigued and inspired by Naomi's ability to create poetry from such sources as a car manual, a newspaper article, a taco sign, \"the hair on the head of the girl in front of me in school,\" Julia Child's patting potatoes, or a vapor trail \"X\" that a pair of planes have inadvertently left in the sky. Being a book of \"Poems for Girls\" there are also the requisite handful of \"longing\" poems: \"High Hopes It wasn't that they were so high, exactly, they were more low-down, close-to-the-ground, I could rub them the way you touch a cat that rubs against your ankles even if he isn't yours. So yes I feel lonely without them. Now that I know the truth, that I only dreamed someone liked me, the cat has curled up in a bed of leaves against the house and I still have to do everything I had to do before without a secret hum inside.\" Despite being a guy, I really enjoyed the images and memories conjured up by these poems. Whether reading \"Visiting My Old Kindergarten Teacher, Last Day of School,\" \"Turtle\" (about the persistent creature that had walked for twenty years), or \"Across the Aisle\" (about the little girl who coughed \"every 30 seconds for seven whole hours\" on a transatlantic flight), I've repeatedly interrupted Rosemary's reading on the couch and Shari's grading papers at the kitchen table in order to have an audience with whom to share the poems aloud. \"Big Head, Big Face (what my brother said to me) If your head had been smaller maybe you woulda had less thoughts in it, maybe you wouldn't have so many troubles.

It's about history of the world, belief, archetypes of American culture, and it's not.  All of these things are present, but none of them overshadow the others. It's a great story, with great characters. Read it. It has all of the beauty of typical Gaiman prose (maybe the best \"post modern\" writer, stylistically at least), the strangeness of the best horror/fantasy/psyche thriller, and a few laughs and tears.

Overall a very good read for those who enjoy speculative fiction with a darkly humorous twist.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Classic Gaiman, reminiscent of Sandman</td><td>4.0</td><td>Winner of the 2002 Hugo award for best novel. In the story, \"Shadow\", who manages to remain something of an enigma despite being the central character of the story, becomes embroiled in a free-ranging and very surreal metaphysical/metaphorical struggle between the Gods ... both ancient and new, foreign and domestic. During the story, Shadow also undergoes an epic journey of his own, that is both physical in nature, as well as something of a spiritual \"walkabout\" of the soul. I won't say more, in order to avoid giving out any \"spoilers\". It's a great book, and it's classic Gaiman - suffused as it is with motifs ranging from ancient history and mythology, folklore, religion, archeology & anthropology, philosophy, magic (both real and sleight of hand), world travel, pop culture & music, esoteric and classical literature, and so much more. Gaiman's works resonate deeply with me, because he's one of the very few authors out there who, like me, is obviously a fan of Joseph Campbell, and an avid student of ancient mythology and folklore. Somewhere inside  me lies a part that was subconsciously planning to write a book like this one someday, and that part of me feels a slight pang of loss seeing it done first, and better, by someone else. I felt much the same way when the original \"The Crow\" movie came out, which bore many resemblances to a shadowrun character I'd been working on fairly heavily at the time. In any case, it's highly recommended. If you enjoyed \"The Sandman\", you will enjoy this novel too, because it's spiritually related in both general theme and substance. NOTE: Please be advised that the idiots who published this book included a major spoiler when they penned the blurb for the back cover ... so, my advice is that you do NOT read that blurb until after you finish the book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>End the problems of stress for good!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've read lots of books and listened expensive tape programs on stress management.  They helped some, but caused problems in that the excercises were too time comsuming, didn't always work, took too long to work, or was just to expensive.  The techniques offered in Stress Free for Good are simple, quick (takes only 1 minute), and incredibly powerful.  I've never felt so good in my life.  I've never been so efficient in all my tasks and responsibilities either.  The quality of my work has also improved.

This narrow and simplistic view on my part has been somewhat comforting, after all it took a number of factors and many years of indoctrination for these folks to calmly take their lives and the lives of thousands of incidents.  I say comforting because just how many of these guys can there be?  Unfortunately this book details that the men involved in the 9/11 attacks were primarily bored, unemployed and living in societies with significant economic problems.  They just happened to chose a course that lead them into performing the worst terrorist attacks ever.  This is concern because as the author points out , there are millions more young men in the same position that can only turn to religion for comfort and need a enemy to hate. This book gives the reader a very interesting view of some of the 9/11 highjackers.  The author writes in a way that is as captivating as a fiction book.  He makes even the most normal run down of facts interesting.  It helps that the ultimate event has so much drama surrounding it.  Overall I enjoyed the book.  It is full of facts presented without a lot of over the top reasoning about how these people hate us because of our freedom.  It is an eye opener and if you are interested in the war on terror or the 9/11 attacks I think you will find the book well worth the time.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Quite well-written.  Very strange.</td><td>3.0</td><td>It's obvious that Gaiman has a unique writing style that is all his own and while he is skilled and the words themselves flow comfortably, I couldn't help but spend the entirety of the book feeling bewildered and confused.  The confusing thing wasn't the writing, but rather the story itself, which was so incredibly surreal that it left my head hurting. Even now I sit here with a furrowed brow a little conflicted about what to tell you concerning this book.  Thus I will give you this:  - oddly enough the best character development surrounded the supporting cast rather than the protagonist who was flat and under-developed.  I didn't care much about his outcome.  Part of what caused me such bewilderment on this one is that he seemed to have almost no or completely inappropriate emotions about some pretty profound things that affected him within the story.  It made him seem like a cardboard cut-out.  - rather anti-climactic story-line overall.  The book seems to revolve around a series of events that almost happen.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It's very strange.  - I'm not against sexuality or language within a story in so far as it supports the story and builds characterization (my favorite books are the Song of Ice and Fire group by George R. R. Martin which belive me, have their fair share) but I felt like there was a good bit of profanity and sexuality present here simply for the sake of its presence.  - other than that the story was fairly well written and has a distinct style that would be well recieved if the overall plot of the book and design of the characters was more definitely fleshed out. In conclusion, while the author shows that he has skill and talent, his story played out in my mind with blurry edges and no definition, leaving me feeling a little drunk and bewildered.  I can't decide whether I'd recommend it or not so I give it three stars - right in the middle, which is where this story lives.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Nothing new here but ultimately good</td><td>4.0</td><td>Though the majority of this book contained suggestions that were not new to me, I did enjoy reading it if for nothing else than as a reinforcement and a reminder.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Mostly Common Sense</td><td>4.0</td><td>But I most say that there are three suggestions that I found to be helpful- not a cure all but these three offered me a bit of peace of mind so I would say its worth the cash.

I learned many things I either didn't know or had misconceptions about. For example, I'd heard that most of the 9/11 hijackers didn't know it was a suicide mission- a somehow comforting thought. McDermott makes the convincing case that every one of them knew they were about to die and embraced their path to paradise. This is a must read for anyone who wants insight to what these fanatics were really thinking.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Modern mythology at its best</td><td>5.0</td><td>Shadow, a man whose life is torn apart just when he thought it was getting better, is all-too-conveniently offered a job by a mysterious man who seems to know a little too much. It becomes obvious all too soon that his employer and his associates (not to mention their enemies) are more than men, and they're not quite willing to let Shadow know what exactly is going on. If you're a mythology buff and you don't mind Gaiman taking some liberties with the personalities of various deities, you'll love this. I was a fan of Sandman and Good Omens (co-authored with Terry Pratchett, who I also strongly reccommend) before I read American Gods, and I like the way he takes different mythologies and recombines them into a new story, even when it's not entirely true to the original myth. This book continues that theme, and it does so wonderfully. If you know your mythology, you'll have a fun game of hide-and-seek with all the gods he's packed in here- some of them are fairly obscure, and I don't think there are any of the more popular Greek or Roman gods mentioned. And if you pay close enough attention, you can figure out who the mysterious Mr. Wednesday is long before it is revealed to Shadow.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Good writing, but drawn out story</td><td>2.0</td><td>I found this story to be quite boring for a while.  To sum it up, I didn't really get interested until about the 500th page and then it was over 50 pages later, along with a drawn out resolution to cover all the other loose ends from all the other subplots, which I didn't really care about by then. The writing was good.

The details of his life are too sketchy to justify a really thorough biography. Granted. My problem with Prose's book is that too little attention is given to the paintings. There are a few paintings reproduced in small color plates, but even these are not analyzed properly. Big fans of Caravaggio will be disappointed to find that 'Supper at Emmaus' for example is missing entirely. Also missing is an annotated index of the artist's works.  Equally reprehensible is the mention in the text of paintings that are not represented in the plates at all. An artist's legacy is not his life, but his work, and it is his work that should have received more attention in this volume.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Don't Start Your Gaiman Reading Here</td><td>3.0</td><td>Even mediocre Gaiman is good reading, so by that analysis, this is a good book.  However, American Gods is not Neil Gaiman's best work.  Start with Season of Mists which features most of the same characters from American Gods in a similar plot.  Other good places to start if you've never read any Gaiman include Good Omens and/or Smoke & Mirrors (short fiction.) One thing about American Gods that amused me quite a bit was the fact that large chunks of it are set in my home state of Wisconsin.  It's hard to tell if Gaiman did field research here or if he got most of his information from an atlas and Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion.  Dairy cows, cranberries and the Packers are never mentioned, so that's a knock against authenticity, but the main character eats a pasty in northern Wisconsin so that makes up for things. I listened to this book on CD and so, a few remarks on that...  George Guidall does his customarily amazing job with the read.  Well articulated with great inflection, Guidall's voice has the texture of a cinematic voice over.  He does convincing accents for all the different gods in the story. Definitly worth a read/listen.  I just wouldn't put it at the top of my list.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>over-rated & pretentious</td><td>2.0</td><td>This novel concerns a battle between the old gods of the old country, mainly from Norse mythology, and the new gods of internet, credit cards, and television. They are getting ready for a showdown, a battle to end the battles. In America, the old gods are dying and the new gods are taking over. Mr Wednesday (Wotan) enlists former convict Shadow to help him through the battle. Shadow doesn't quite know what he is getting into, but goes along since his wife died with his best friend in a car accident before he was released from prison. There are some asides in this book, short stories in their own right, philosophical meanderings about the death of the old gods and what this means. Ultimately, we are told that the individualistic streak in Americans, where everyone can pick and choose their own philosophy and creed, is what is causing the death of the old gods. There are many different directions to go with this. The idea of this novel are brilliant, and the meticulous research is obvious. Mr Gaiman did his homework here. But the problems are manifold. The ideas may be great, but Mr Gaiman doesn't go anywhere with them. The characters are very flat, and Shadow, as the lead, is about as dull as it gets; almost as if Mr Gaiman had decided on casting a literary Keanu Reeves for the part. The second major problem with the book is Mr Gaiman`s prose. As flat and uninteresting as the characters he draws, the style has the pretensions of being literary but doesn't come anywhere close. (See The Club Dumas, which has excellent style and a great story but was completely ignored by the fantasy community, and The Horned Man by James Lasdun, which will likewise be ignored.) His constant references to other writers and titles is forced and extremely annoying. It is far too self-conscious, a literary game of \"look at me! I know who these writers are!\" (An aside here; this type of thing seems to belong the fantasy, science fiction and horror genre more than anywhere else.) Mr Gaiman often uses his characters as mere mouthpieces for his holier-than-thou proselytizing, a device straight out of Heinlein. Mr Gaiman seems to want to be a literary writer and a great storyteller. Mainstream popular writers often feel that this is impossible, but the market is rife with novels that have tremendous style, timeless stories, and authors who do not put their egos in the reader's way. Mr Gaiman seems to be a good story-telling writer (but not much in this book) but not a literary writer.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Concise and Precise Brief Study of Caravaggio</td><td>5.0</td><td>The series of books Eminent Lives being produced by General Editor James Atlas for Atlas Books, a division of Harper Collins is a true project that fills a vital need in the paucity of the arts education in this country at present.  Coupling excellent writers with biographies of great people is long overdue and after reading Francine Prose's very fine but succinct evaluation of the life of painter Caravaggio the reader will want to collect all of the volumes of this educational and enlightening series. Though there are many huge tomes readily available on the art and the wild life of Michelangelo Merisi (da Caravaggio) that offer a much more complete view of the great artist's artist output and more detailed accounts of his sexual life  and his criminal life involving the church and the state throughout Italy during his relatively brief life (1571 - 1610). Francine Prose  approaches her subject more as a novelist than as reportage.  She covers the important aspects of Caravaggio's influences, his beginnings, his particular gifts of painting that incorporated models form the street to depict religious icons, his miraculous understanding and reproduction of light and shadow, and his propensity to follow his hedonistic needs in lieu of being faithful to his career. This is a physically small volume (perfect for tucking into the jacket pocket or purse for reading away from home) and therein lays its main drawback: the few reproductions of paintings that serve to underline Prose's commentary  are too small to satisfy the art lover.  But for those images there are many monographs surveys available that may serve as adjuncts to this concise Eminent Life.  Recommended. Grady Harp, January 06</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Waste of Good Prose</td><td>3.0</td><td>Francine Prose's charming brief introduction to the life and art of Caravaggio simply doesn't belong in the Eminent Lives series--not because he was unworthy.  Rather, the spartan production standards of the series precluded including enough of his art to give a reader even a clue as to what the author was describing.  For example, her descriptions and analyses of \"The Fortune Teller\" and \"The Card Sharps\" were really quite good, but without the paints near at hand, most readers will find it difficult to appreciate them. Obviously, anyone familiar with his art would hardly buy an introduction to it; lacking appropriate illustration, the volume is unlikely to add to the ranks of Caravaggio's admirers.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Would you buy a used car from this god?</td><td>5.0</td><td>The gods are born by the human decision to worship them, live as long as they are remembered, and die if they are forgotten: The idea is at least as old as Richard Garnett's \"Twilight of the Gods\" short story. So what happens to gods when they become casual memories, no longer worshipped but lingering at the edge of consciousness? Gaiman would suggest that Odin is the oldest American god who has not passed entirely from our memory, having arrived with the first Viking visitors (unless Gaiman is doing a bit more with prehistory and that mammoth skull than I caught in one reading; I *think* that god is dead). He's also going to let us know {warning: very slight spoiler} that the American Odin is not the same as the Scandanavian one, though they were once the same (new conceptions of the gods become, in effect, new and separate gods). So we know the old gods, Odin and all the rest of those folks from a variety of traditions. And we meet a few of the new gods, like the TV set and the 'net and 'Media' and maybe Elvis (a fun touch: do we meet Elvis or not? Gaiman does mention his name). The plot? Oh, these gods are going to have a war, and our protagonist is going to find himself in the middle of it. That, and a subplot or two, serves to hold our interest as Gaiman invites us to join in his cynical reflection on American values: What are our gods? Do we have any who are worth our thoughts, let alone our worship? On the surface it's a good story, an intriguing fantasy piece with a cynical message. It also has a bit of depth -- the protagonist is named 'Shadow' with good reason, and more shadows than him lurk in the background of this book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>If you're a little strange, you'll like this book</td><td>4.0</td><td>Its a very unique book, with a storyline balancing paranormal weirdness with all-too-normal weirdness. Highly readable, if not a definite classic for the ages. I won't go in detail, that's what the other 400 reviews seem to be for (Note to potential reviewers: these aren't book reports. Spoilers suck). Nevertheless, I must admit the parallels to Douglas Adam's \"Long Dark Teatime of the Soul\" struck me early. Nevertheless, where that was a comedic take on a similar theme, this work is far more surreal and a little more dark, and both have a deep consideration for the subject at hand.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Slowly Plodding but Payoff is worth the wait</td><td>4.0</td><td>This was the second Neil Gaiman novel I read.  Coming off of the high that was the magnificient Neverwhere, I hungrily started reading American Gods. The concept is definitely interesting, that the gods from history dating back to Odin are still alive and well.  Having fallen from public eye and mind, they are reduced to almost nothing.  Meanwhile, the new things we worship, TV internet etc have become more powerful gods and there is a war brewing. The novel, however, is slowly plodding as it builds a very large web of characters.  It's part road trip, part fantasy and at times partly boring.  Mostly it's because there is a very slow build up of tension as Gaiman introduces characters, ploys and plots.  It isn't until the midpoint where something huge happens that the novel truly takes off.  But even when it takes off, it does it at its own pace.  The payoff at the end, however, is spectacular and ties up the story really well. Fans of Gaiman will enjoy this novel.  I think, for me, the problem was coming off such a high given by Neverwhere that whatever I read next couldn't possibly live up to it.  It's still a really good novel.  It's not his best but it's an enjoyable read and has some great commentary about out culture and religion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A modern tale of gods walking the Earth</td><td>4.0</td><td>The premise of Neil Gaiman's book is not particularly original: at least 2 original series Trek episodes (\"Who Mourns for Adonis?\" and \"Squire of Gothos\") are basically the same idea.  To wit: the gods are real, and they walk the Earth.  They grow powerful when people worship them, weaken when indifference sets in, and die when people forget them.  However, to my great delight, Gaiman has created a novel unlike any other - part travelogue, part suspense-thriller, and part action-adventure.  There is also an ample sampling of humour. Perhaps the most original part of the book is the selection of gods Gaiman chooses.  Some will be known to most readers - Odin, Easter, Jaquel (the Egyptian god with the head of a Jackel), and Kali (made famous for my generation by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). But many more were completely unknown to me.  I was reminded of the quote, \"stealing from one person is plaigerism, stealing from everyone is genius.\"  Gaiman selects a few gods from many different pantheons and throws them together on a quest - to defend themselves from the hostile takeover by the new gods of Television, the Internet, etc. Such a synopsis makes the novel sound silly, but somehow Gaiman makes it work and lends it the gravity it deserves.  After all, if it's one thing that the old gods lack, it's a sense of humour.  We are taken through the trip by Shadow, who early on throws his lot in with Odin.  His wife has been killed in a car accident, but apparently the gold coin (given to him by a leprechaun) he drops on her grave brings her back in some sort of undead state.  More than once she bails Shadow out, then disappears to take a job at a gas station because, after all, even the undead need to pay the rent! The interest and fun of the story is in the writing.  It is fascinating to see gods unknown to me, but some of his choices I have to question.  After all, wouldn't more people know Zeus than Odin, and if so, why wouldn't Zeus be the head guy instead?  Such details are only puzzling after the fact.  While reading the book, it's very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone. P.S. The book won the Hugo, even though it is patently not a science fiction story.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>An okay entertainment.</td><td>3.0</td><td>This is a pretty good post-modern gothic potboiler.

But, the great premise of an American mythology personified and come to life is undermined by truly disturbing sexual and violent content (no spoilers here though). The sex and violence seemed to only be in here to shock, not to tell a story. I don't think I'm a prude but there are some things I just don't want to read about and unfortunately, this book contained them. Which probably explained by it achieved best-seller status. Sometimes, it's nice not to be in the norm. Why 2 stars then?

My first of Neil Geiman. Long have I heard of his legacy but then I also heard that he was somewhat overrated. Not in this case. I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up the book and I did so solely because of a good review. It turned out to be just the kind of thing that I love - the past and the present, the myth and the facts, the evil and the good, the real and the surreal rolled into one giant, wild ball that takes you on a fantastic downhill ride. You have to know your history, you have to know a bit about mythology and  you have to let go of rationality to enjoy this one. Very well written, fluent and delightful to read. Yes, there are cases when the most rational reader will raise an eyebrow and find the given events too absurd for a good, logical book, but if you take the whole thing as a fantasy journey and assume the logic of dreams instead of the logic of the waking world, it fits like a glove. Not a simple, action packed thriller, by all means! Buy it only if you have enough patience to try to see what lurks beneath the surface of the apparent words. Similar and yet different to this one, is \"Lord of Light\" by Roger Zelazny. Actually there is not much of a similarity except the ingenius work at hand and the tackling of the concept of gods and how it would be if we assumed them to be less perfect than what they are said to be.

Many little diversions from the main story line were quite entertaining, and I was looking forward to them all coming together in the end.  But, they never really do.  It felt like reading creative rambling.  Or, listening to a long, intricate joke that has a weak punch line. I thought about the whole book after reading it and really didn't see the the whole god/american culture battle message as very profound.

John Maynard Keynes - a product of early 20th century - believed in a big, activist government, expensive government programs, and high taxes.  Like Keynes, Krugman truly believes that any country can tax itself into prosperity as long as it spends the funds on social programs (often called \"infrastructure\".) This theory of economics fell on hard times during the great depression.  Despite Keynes' best writings, massive government spending and make work social programs did not result in full employment and monetary liquidity.  The relatively austere economic policies of the United States in the years since put the lie to Keynes' theories. However, like many so called economists who hawk warmed-over Keynes, Krugman is not really an economist, but a newspaper columnist for the New York Times.  He is a Big Government Liberal in the mold of Roosevelt and Johnson.  Smaller government and lower taxes makes him mad, even if the unemployment rate is at historical lows. Where Krugman really gets it wrong is his evaluation of Alan Greenspan's performance as Fed Chairman.  Where Krugman praises Greenspan's performance during the Clinton Administration, he accuses Greenspan as being an enabler for the Bush tax cuts. Therein Krugman exposes himself as a rank partisan writer, not an economic thinker.  The Clinton Administration's budgetary and economic policies were positively anti-Keynesian and ran against Krugman's desire for government economic activism.  Under Clinton, government got smaller, spent less than it took in, and cut back on social programs.  Pay that no mind, because Clinton raised taxes to Krugman's applause.  While Krugman praises Alan Greenspan's Clinton era performance, Alan Greenspan foolishly pursued a tight monetary policy and drove the country into a recession for no reason whatsoever before the end of Clinton's presidency. Conversely, under Bush, government is spending like a drunken sailor on shore leave, which a good Keynesian like Krugman should like, but since Bush cut taxes and Greenspan went along with Bush on it, Krugman thinks Bush's and Greenspan's performances are bad. Like Krugman's good friend and fellow New York Times columnist Marueen Dowd, Krugman wakes up every morning looking for a reason to bash Bush, not thinking about reasonable economic policies.  For Krugman to continue to pawn himself off as an honest economist amounts to fraud.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Lacking in Objectivity</td><td>3.0</td><td>I read Krugman's book earlier this year. He raises some valid points about America's economy, actions of the Fed, as well as some of the priorities of the current political leadership. I found some of Krugman's arguments compelling, but there is a bias that pervades the entire book. For example, Alan Greenspan was a great guy and did wonderful work during the Clinton years. However, under the Bush administration he's an enabler and, consequently, not nearly as good as he used to be. Given that Krugman is an economist, I would have had much more respect for this work had there been less bias and more objectivity.

This book is in a different ballpark. First of all, the world which Gaiman creates is so engaging.  When I finished the book, I found that I missed visiting his world in a way I don't recall experiencing with any other book. Secondly, the story is fascinating.  Mixing ancient mythology (a hobby of mine) and great story-telling, he weaves a yarn which works on many levels: sociological commentary on mankind, modern fable, and so on. His style is good, although he's perhaps no Bradbury or Cervantes; but the story is so compelling and his imagination so engrossing that I cannot but highly reccommend it.  However, I ought to point out that it is a very graphic book, with some bizarre sexual situations and a lot of violence and language.  Watch out for that.

Kruggy is swimming in the same toilet with the Big Bad Bush he whines about all the time via his book(s) and op-eds in the NY Times. While Paul has the educational credits and sheepskins, he comes off as a book \"smart\" dude who can't: read a simple road map; tie his own shoe's; zipper up his own pants; keep his foot out of his mouth... The major fraud that Corporate America was pulling on American investors before Enron was unraveled in 2001 was alive and thriving during the 8 loooong years of the Bubba Clinton era as POTUS. Bubba was the King of executive liars whether they be CEO's of the FORTUNE 500+ or CEO of the US of A. Let's face it citizens BOTH Democrats and Republican's holding political office, liberal or conservative, owe that office to BIG donators of their campaigns. These donators include the BIG Drug, Insurance, Oil... BusyNesses. Is it any surprise that these politician's have yet to pass a decent Health Care Plan, no matter that 40+ million American's have zero health care insurance since 1992, and pay 2+ times more than the citizens of Canada for the same drugs! Pauly Boy rants on about Bush and the right wing Republican party, butt Clinton did nada to improve health care, even when the Democrats had a majority in Congress. Hillary failed to give us a decent health care plan in 1992, not entirely her fault cause Congress ain't going to pass such legislation and upset Big Drug/Insurance companies. The rich get richer, and we are becoming more a nation of have and have nots. The blame rests with ALL politicians who have held office past and present in the executive and legislative branch of government.  The media ain't no help with clowns like Krugman who only promote their own agenda's and self(ego) interests. In this book, how many times does Pauly Boy pat his own back and behind? The answer is - GOBS of times!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Worthwhile Read, Although It Has Issues</td><td>3.0</td><td>The vast majority of the book consists of articles written by Mr. Krugman over the last five years. Most of the articles outline Mr. Krugman's issues with the policies of the current Bush administration in an easy-to-follow and thoughtful manner. After reading the book I am left with two main issues: Obvisouly Mr. Krugman is limited in space in his articles, but here he wrote a book. If he thinks we are on the wrong track why does he not suggest what we shuold be doing? That would really complete the book.  Also, the last chapter does not flow well as the ending. I was expecting a summary of sorts, but the last chapter seems to be the miscellaneous thoughts folder.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Mixed Terrain in This One</td><td>3.0</td><td>Overall, I enjoyed the general writing style of this book. Some of the descriptions of the people and places were much more evocative than descriptions of the same in other K2 literature. On the other hand, the author's attempts to develop the internal dialogues and thoughts of her subjects eventually became a bit heavy-handed. There also seemed to be a few mathematical errors with dates and numbers of climbers. By the end, it was also clear that the author was unable to maintain journalistic distance from one of her subjects. In fact, it seemed as though she had fallen in love with the climber who served as the anchor of her book. This seems to have led her down the path of casting aspersion on the incredible achievements of Edurne Pasaban and Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, two incredible, determined  women that have surpassed the author's hero and summitted all 14 8000m peaks.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Brilliant Concept With Mediocre Execution</td><td>3.0</td><td>I'm a longtime fan of Neil Gaiman's work, but after reading American Gods it seems to me that dialogue is not the strongest aspect of his talent. The novel's concept is brilliant - the Old World gods fighting for survival in the New World - but Gaiman lacks a vision for where his characters are going (ironic, because it always seemed he was in complete control of this in his Sandman work). So, the novel ambles along and occasionally becomes downright boring.  Gaiman is at his best when telling stories of the old gods - his gift is clearly his ability to construct an intriguing narrative - but he is at his worst when characters actually have to speak to one another. Dialogue often sounds forced, particularly when Gaiman attempts to have them speak \"American\" English. It's clear the author was aiming for a great American novel, but he only sees the surface and his ear for how we Americans sound is superficial at best.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Somewhat heavy handed</td><td>4.0</td><td>This was a bit too Jezebel-y in spots for me -- the whole \"I am woman hear me roar\" rhapsodizing about women who were clearly complicated and not always nice people got to be a bit much sometimes, and I think it detracted from a really fascinating look at women who had to literally force themselves into this very macho field of endeavor.  These ladies weren't shrinking violets (and more power to them for that!) and their stories deserve to be told as much as those of the Mallorys and Hillarys -- the purple prose could be edited out easily, and I think the impact of these really amazing stories would be all the greater.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Recycling history?</td><td>5.0</td><td>Those disturbed by intemperate language or emotionally-charged critiques of the Bush regime would do well to consider this excellent essay collection.  Krugman's clear logic and firm analyses of economic, social and political policies are incisive and illuminating.  Bush's rise to power and actions since achieving the presidency are a \"conservative revolution\".  Krugman sees this regime as casting away long-held American ideals, fomenting class strife in a traditionally classless society and embarking on foreign policies disdainful of global reaction.  Bush clearly holds the mass of American society in comtempt, showing favouritism to a limited group of the powerful.  Using fear as a primary weapon, Bush's team has assaulted the financial structure, the environment and even American culture itself. As an economic scholar, Krugman opens the series with essays on economic policies - banking, corporate greed and dollar politics.  He examines the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s and draws vivid parallels with the path America is taking.  He sidesteps the \"everything will be all right - just trust us\" mode of economic thinking.  He probes into promises and the underlying realities with a surgeon's skill.  What he exposes is equally stomach-churning.  The American economy, notwithstanding the shrill declarations of the Bush administration, is teetering on the brink.  Krugman's descriptive exposure of Bush mathematics ranges from \"fuzzy\" to \"false\".  Not encouraging for the future. The Bush fallacies, Krugman argues, lie on the backs and wallets of the American populace.  And these deceptions go beyond purely economic issues.  In the 1930s, another revolutionary's rise to power was greeted by many as a welcome relief from bombast.  \"He will be forced to temper his earlier pronouncements\".  Krugman shows how the Bush campaign and administration has foisted the same self-deception by the American public and media.  Abetted by the WTC attacks, Bush has wrapped himself in the flag, insulating his declarations from criticism or complaint.  The immense switch from a budget surplus to deficit was excused by the needs of the \"war on terror\".  Krugman deftly dissects that argument, displaying the fallacies of logic and fact the public is expected to swallow.  Rights are curtailed, monies diverted to special interests and presidential power is unconstitutionally enhanced.  It is, Krugman stresses, a time of a \"conservative\" [read \"reactionary\"] revolution  overthrowing long-standing American traditions.  \"Yes, Virginia\", he says, \"there is a right-wing conspiracy\". The 1930s revolutionary made ever increasing demands.  \"Compromise\", was known even then as \"appeasement\".  Krugman shows appeasement is a dangerous a policy.  Failure to curtail unreasonable demands only leads to further demands.  The greedy revolutionary cannot be satiated.  In Hitler's day, the issue was \"lebensraum\" - the quest for more living space.  Today, the issue is domestic power over the population, permitting adventurism abroad.  Now it's not just \"lebensraum\" but \"corporate lebensraum\" - resources access and unlimited opportunity to exploit them with minimal return for the privilege.  Then, the appeasers were the politicians of Western Europe.  Today, to Krugman's dismay, it is America's media.  Informing the public was once the traditional role of the media.  Now it is the propaganda tool of corporations with control by only five corporations.  AOLTimeWarnerGeneralElectricDisneyWestinghouseNewsCorp as Krugman deems it.  This unity reflects the group's alliance as an administration voice.  Dissent, a long American tradition, is now curtailed at the source.  Bush's policies are excused, supported, even promulgated by a media sharing the exercise of power over the general population. While it might seem an essay collection stretching back several years would strike a discordant chronological note, this is not the case here.  By assembling a string of columns, Krugman offers reminders of events that affect us now.  Topically arranged, this anthology provides continuity that might otherwise be lost unless you've taken the trouble to collect his work.  Krugman is a serious thinker and he's seriously concerned with issues that have meaning to us all.  As the world's most powerful nation, it is foolish to assume America's problems lie wholly within her borders.  American policies have a distant reach and have already been implemented with military might.  In line with any military environment, control of policies, resources and thought are part of the Bush agenda.  Bush wants the world to be \"like America\", but if that model stands on shaky ground, its not a pattern other societies want to follow.  Krugman has pointed out the problems, but declares that it's up to the American people to set things right themselves.  These are not problems that will be overcome by a new version of \"Crusade in Europe\".

Recognizing the Bush administration as a revolutionary force set to dismantle the New Deal reforms helps to put things in perspective. Once you realize that his goal is to privatize things like medicare and education by sabotaging them, much of the news starts to make sense. Krugman's book is a collection of columns, so there is alot of repetition, but that will help many readers understand complex issues that need a little repeating. I would recommend this book to someone who starting to realize that our current administration's motives are suspect.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>I was actually disappointed</td><td>3.0</td><td>This is not Neil Gaiman's best. That does not mean it is bad - quite the contrary, it is pretty good. I just got the feeling when I read it that after the well-deserved success of Neverwhere he felt he had to write something similar for the US market. Neverwhere dealing with London, UK. It was kind of obvious to me that he is not as familiar with the mystic and magic of the US as he is of London. The American Gods of the book are surprisingly poorly developed, and he chooses Odin as one of the main protagonists, which gives a bit of a tired feeling to me. On the other hand, the description of the restless wife and the protected American small-town are truly chilling and up there with his best.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Could have been great</td><td>3.0</td><td>When I began reading this book, the premise seemed promising; I thought this would be a real page-turner. A man finds himself in the midst of a battle between old gods long forgotten and new gods. Whoa! Seemed like heavy stuff. The narrative is good. Shadow's whimsical sarcastic sense of humor had me laughing out loud at times (most memorable was the scene where he meets the raven). The book reminded me of Clive Barker's early fantastique novels (Weaveworld, Great and Secret Show, Imajica) where ordinary people became embroiled in matters involving other worlds. The problem with American Gods was there really was no plot so much as a pattern: 1.) Hear about the upcoming storm 2.) Move to a new location 3.) Hide 4.) Get discovered. 5.) Repeat. So, along the way, we meet interesting characters (human and non-human), but nothing happens to propel the story forward. The only reason that I didn't quit the book early is because Shadow is a likable character and you do want to know how certain relationships end, if they do at all. 3/4's of the way, Gaiman finally writes \"And so the storm began.\"  I won't say anything about the storm, other than \"That's it!?\" But Mr. Gaiman could have turned a great premise into a cool book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>If Stephen King wrote Superheroes</td><td>3.0</td><td>From the first chapter, the things that struck me most about \"American Gods\" was the similarity to Stephen King's writing style in some of his more mediocre horror books. Like King, there are wonderful, creative ideas (old gods walking the Earth; new gods taking over for ideas like mass media and the Internet). Like King, there are diverse characters with layers of issues (the main character, Shadow, develops a rather unique relationship with his dead wife, a plot perhaps more interesting than the earth-shaking main device). Like King, there is a tendency toward adolescent melodrama (note especially how Shadow's wife dies). Like many of King's novels, the ending fizzles.  Perhaps there was nowhere to go that would live up to the incredible ideas presented earlier in the book, or perhaps others were satisfied with the (thoroughly foreshadowed, yet still somewhat disappointing) \"twist\" at the end. (**SPOILER**: I would have loved to see the effect upon the world when some of the modern gods bought the farm--does the loss of the god of strategic arms limitation pacts immediately dissolve such pacts and ensure a new arms race?  This would have given the events toward the end a more epic feel, though perhaps Gaiman wanted something closer in tone to the very last scene, which was somewhat reflective and more interesting than the entire second half of the book.) The book did get me to do some research on mythology, though:  some of the \"name that god\" you will inevitably play while reading the book is very enjoyable, and the amount of research put into the characters is stunning. Don't expect the great American novel:  expect an above-average action read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>So close to perfect</td><td>4.0</td><td>It was difficult to not give this book 5 stars as I really enjoyed it and had trouble putting it down when I had to. The idea is a very original conception and I liked the main character and how he dealt with all the strange things that are happening. The imperfections are that its too long and wanders off story from time to time, and most importantly for me was the intimation for hundreds of pages that a big battle was brewing and then the ending instead was a pastiche of too many different elements and just kind of  petered out. All in all though, a great read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>HIs Nose Ran Like Corn Flakes</td><td>3.0</td><td>Dennis Lehane has written several good booksmuch later on after this one. I have very much liked Mystic River, A Given Day, and Shutter Island. He still had a lot to learn when he wrote this first book. I thought the story was all right, but there were some things about his writing that gnaw at me. Mr. Lehane seems to tolerate clich and imprecisely chosen words in his descriptions all too often. Its annoying, and I wonder why he does this. Does he get tired? Is he in a hurry? I don't know, but heres what I mean. He writes: I picked a dark blue, double-breasted Armani from my closetone of several I received from a client in lieu of cash, found the appropriate shoes, tie, and shirt, and before you could say, GQ, I was looking good enough to eat. Good enough to eat. That's not very cute or fresh. It distracts the reader like a sore thumb. And this: The young doorman, with cheeks so smooth he must've skipped puberty altogether, opened the heavy brass door and said, \"Welcome to the Ritz Carlton, sir.\" He meant it, too, his voice trembling with pride that I'd chosen his quaint little hotel. I truly cant imagine any doormans voice, young or old, actually trembling with pride, can you? I think this is an example of a writer trying too hard to write. If Mr. Lehane were truly in the scene, he wouldn't observe this or write it. Another thing: the Ritz Carlton (there is one) is not a quaint little hotel. It just isn't, and it is jarring to hear it characterized that way. Its not important; its just unnecessarily wrong. And this: My shoes clacked with military crispness on the marble floor, and the sharp creases of my pants reflected in the brass ashtrays. Okay, there are floor standing brass ashtrays. Some are columnar and very shiny. They distort what they reflect and its not a likely place to observe the sharp detail of sharp creases in ones pants. You wouldn't. Just one more: He crossed the carpet in three long strides, his Jack Kennedy smiled extended just behind his hand. I took the hand. Hi, Jim.\" I imagine floating dentures, hovering in the air behind his hand. I know he doesnt mean this, but say it properly, please. Mr. Lehane is getting to a clever observation, but he bungles it. I got by all this and more of the same to generally enjoy the story. I just wonder, with a little frustration, why this author doesnt take the time to polish his work before releasing it. In a practical sense, he doesnt have to, I know. Many readers don't notice these kinds of flaws and could care less. All in all, it was a good enough book, but not of the top shelf variety where all the words matter.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Surprisingly Bad</td><td>1.0</td><td>The \"heroine\" of this book was so awful, so self-centered, that I couldn't finish it.

So what's going on? What's this gang at dot.gov.whitehouse up to? As Krugman puts it: Put it this way: Suppose that you actually liked a caste society, and you were seeking ways to use your control of the government to further entrench the advantages of the haves against the have-nots. What would you do? One thing you would definitely do is get rid of the estate tax, so that large fortunes can be passed on to the next generation. More broadly, you would seek to reduce tax rates both on corporate profits and on unearned income such as dividends and capital gains, so that those with large accumulated or inherited wealth could more easily accumulate even more. You'd also try to create tax shelters mainly useful for the rich. And more broadly still, you'd try to reduce tax rates on people with high incomes, shifting the burden to the payroll tax and other revenue sources that bear most heavily on people with lower incomes. Meanwhile, on the spending side, you'd cut back on healthcare for the poor, on the quality of public education and on state aid for higher education. This would make it more difficult for people with low incomes to climb out of their difficulties and acquire the education essential to upward mobility in the modern economy. And just to close off as many routes to upward mobility as possible, you'd do everything possible to break the power of unions, and you'd privatize government functions so that well-paid civil servants could be replaced with poorly paid private employees. It all sounds sort of familiar, doesn't it? Where is this taking us? Thomas Piketty, whose work with Saez has transformed our understanding of income distribution, warns that current policies will eventually create \"a class of rentiers in the U.S., whereby a small group of wealthy but untalented children controls vast segments of the US economy and penniless, talented children simply can't compete.\" If he's right--and I fear that he is--we will end up suffering not only from injustice, but from a vast waste of human potential.

Heading the list compiled by a former speech writer for Nancy Reagan (does that make her a specialist of some sort?) is Jane Fonda.  She also worked on the campaign of Jack Kemp for president -- who's Jack Kemp?! Certainly he is no Al Gore.  Just because she is a t.v. commentator on CNN (MY, that used to be Ted Turner's property, and he was once married to Jane Fonda!) doesn't give her any valid reason to call anyone \"idiots.\" I am not a liberal or left wing politically, but I believe the Rosenbergs were railroaded and lost their lives as a coverup for corruption of others.  Ethel was guilty only of being a dedicated wife.  Whittaker Chambers, it has been proven beyond a doubt, lied to save his own skin. He kept his distance from McCarthy because of his guilt and Communist inclinations. Alger Hiss, a high-ranking state department official, was much maligned and made a scapegoat, destroying his reputation.  All for what, I ask.  She lays blame where history has declared none existed.  Restoring old, hurtful rumors only brings us all down. If Al Gore is a liberal, then I must be one as I believe in him.  When Lott was called a racist, I told others I am more racist than he could ever be.  How much intelligence does it take to be a secretary to a First Lady, I wonder. And to blaspheme Ed Asner is going too far.  Maybe that Capital Gang has influenced her to be snobbish toward Democrats or people superior in education and knowledge.

Flying home for her funeral, he meets a man named Mr. Wendseday, who offers Shadow a job...and seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does... Shadow finds himself in a world of myriad dangers and mysteries.  What seems to be one thing is in fact another; the danger comes from places he never even dreamed possible.  Is he going insane...or is the explanation for all this too great to comprehend? This novel is, at times, a bit harder to understand.  However, with patience (a rudimentary knowledge of mythology won't hurt, either) everything comes together in the end, for a wham-bam conclusion that'll leave you reeling.

Also as usual, his tale is gritty.  Unlike other of his books however, in 'A Drink Before the War,' there were no surprises.  With consummate skill, Lehane drew me into the ugly world of this story until I was completely engaged in reading - Indeed, so much so, that I have strong feelings about it and am challenged by reviewing it.  The injustices (racial, abuses of power and wealth, infidelity, sordid victimizations, extortions and more) are rampant throughout, and Mackenzie and Gennaro (Lehane's central figures and private investigators, key in other of his books) prevail in a morass of dirty politics and gang warfare.  My personal dilemma is that I'm troubled when a book (or film) causes me to accept - even root for - things that I know are wrong.  I found myself rooting for vigilante justice as this book progressed.  I can't hold Lehane responsible for that - It's another testament to his skill as an author.

It was at those moments that it seemed you were Shadow looking into a world you forgot that existed.  I also found myself constantly looking up the names of the characters to figure out who they really were: some were obvious and others required a bit of work, not to mention the forgettable god that still eludes me.  American Gods is a riddle which probably can be answered in nearly infinite ways.  Its kinda like watching the Matrix movies the first time and scratching your head wondering what just happened.

It's worth mentioning that I had read the sequel to this book years ago without realizing I was now reading a 'first' book in this family story. The covers are similar and there is not a notable announcement on either of my copies suggesting a tie in. Only by wondering why these characters seemed familiar did I finally put it together and realize I was not accidentally reading the same book; this was a different one. That's how strong the characters flaws are. I didn't remember the plot, only how unlikable the stoic mother/grandmother, the bratty daughter and Annemarie herself were. Sara Gruen is such a lovely writer but I am left wondering why she would write about such an unredeemable, clueless person as Annemarie.

The book does suffer from a bit of self-indulgence as Gaiman throws everything he can into the 588-page...epic? Road trip? Love story? That's another part of the problem. The book is ostensibly one man's story being told against the backdrop of some rather grandiose events, but at times it feels like it's actually a patchwork of random short stories that couldn't quite stand on their own. And the ending falls somewhere between cheap bait-and-switch and outright letdown. Getting there is fun, though, not unlike a two-week relationship full of (...), drunken philosophizing and a clean, no-strings-attached parting of ways, self-respect still intact.

Neil Gaiman is certainly a very literate writer of comics.  In fact, over the past 15 years or so, he gave the comic medium a degree of culture and style.  This ability, unfortunately, is not present in his novels.  Strangely, the SANDMAN comic, written for a medium that is usually dismissed as children's fare, is much more intellectual than his novels, which contain much adult fare (sex, blood, violence, etc.) but are hardly constructed on an adult reading level. Gaiman's basic premise definitely got my attention: the last showdown between the gods of old civilization and the so-called gods of modern America.  Sounds great... in fact, the whole plot of the novel is a lot of fun.  The problem is that it is carried out in such an amateurish and lackluster fashion.  Gaiman incorporates many tired standards into this novel to further the plot, give foreshadowing, or whatever.  He of all people should know better!  I knew I was in for a questionable read in the first chapter of the book by this classic and wholly original bit of foreshadowing: \"There's a storm coming\".  Ooooooh, how dark, and how mysterious.  It didn't send shivers down my spine, but it sure did make my stomach turn.  Why not just start the novel with \"It was a dark and stormy night\"?

We have just seen all of these in the recent conflict and Ms. Charen's book provides the evidence that this is a recurring feature of the extreme left. Unless and until Messrs Carter, Clinton, Edwards, Kerry, Kennedy and Chomsky are willing to forthrightly condemn the regimes of Castro and Kim, they will continue to lack any foreign policy credibility. Ms. Charen documents the ongoing historical revisionism of the Cold War. The West won it, no thanks to the left and in spite of it.

Her columns and commentary are among the most well considered among the punditry. She has an agenda, and is not apologetic about it.  Advocacy and shrillness frequently cohabit.  Not in this case. Charen delivers her case with devastating logic, exhaustive research, and plenty of style.  By the end of the book, you will be shaking your head in disbelief.  How could so many people have been so wrong, and still so unrepentant? Besides the simple joy of reading a well-written book on a fascinating subject, \"Useful Idiots\" is a call for awareness and diligence in resisting tyranny.  We Americans are a nice bunch of folks, and frequently we attribute our attitudes to others, especially when they dress up their ideas in \"revolutionary\" jargon. Charen points out that, time after time, we get snookered and horrendous numbers of people die. If you enjoyed Bill Ayers' \"Fugitive Days,\" you will absolutely hate this book. Charen is everything Ayers isn't: calm, logical, diligent, and talented.  This is on my \"must read\" list.

It explains to a new generation why they should not heed the word of an ideology that got the Cold War wrong in so many ways. I can't tell you how many political science \"experts\" I talked to prior to 1990 who insisted that the Soviet Union was \"the real thing\" and why we should either accept 'second place' in the world or at least acknowledge co-dominion with the Soviets. What nonsense!  In her book Charen details the mistakes the left made, and continues to make.  In their rush to appear \"open minded\" and \"reasonable\" they play up to people who's first rule is to deceive.  Some of the points Charen makes will amuse you and some will raise your dander, but each one helps illuminate her theory about the blame America first crowd. If you think you may be a moderate, or wonder what all the fuss is about that \"Cold War\" thing you heard about in school, read this book!  For those of us who cheered Reagan on during the 1980s, this book is a nice vindication of our efforts, and a reminder of why we can't forget the lessons of the Cold War struggle.

Engaging.</td><td>4.0</td><td>It is hard to find the words with which to accurately describe this unique novel.  I was at times charmed by the beautiful way in which the lead character comes to life.  That said I was disturbed from the outset at the strange and tragic turn of events.  Rarely does a novel set you up so well with the first few pages. I would love to describe the story, and will attempt to, although this book may just be one which has to be experienced to be believed.  It is somewhat a tale of a man caught in a battle of ancient gods from mythology like Odin, and includes bar brawls with leprechauns and such.  The lead character is hired to be an \"errand man\" for a forgotten \"god\" trying to battle American society's new \"gods\" of television, technology, and the Internet, which are brought to life as actual beings.  The author does such a tremendous job of weaving the story from the viewpoint of a man so deeply haunted by a recent loss and betrayal that what he experiences in the supernatural is almost taken with a calm disinterest.  The story weaves back and forth with lightning speed between dream, reality and the supernatural, leaving a dreamy feeling while reading. Also dispersed throughout the book are, out of nowhere, brief description of other \"gods\" and events, which read like a rich tapestry of history to a degree where I was looking for footnotes.  I will say this; Mr. Gaiman has an incredible imagination! This is a rather strange book, it is at times a page-turning, stay up all night to finish novel, and at other times goes a bit too far into the horror and graphic depictions of a Stephen King. Some of the more graphic depictions seemed to be unnecessary to the storyline. This should serve as a warning for those who cringe easily.  Despite these drawbacks, I was hooked into the story from the start, and wanted to finish it as fast as I could.  That is itself high praise for a novel.  Well done, strange and overly graphic, but a well written and compelling story.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Good Information But NOT Very Deep........</td><td>2.0</td><td>Mona Charen has written a book that is written well and it is obvious that she knows the subject matter.

Jesus is referenced only once in the entire book...two lines are used to describe him as a 'lucky son of a virgin'. Little details about all the deities takes up most of the space in the book and not enough attention is paid to the 'modern gods'. And why would gods like Odin and the rest even remain at all? The only example of a modern day pagan god that seemed believable in the slightest was that of Eostre, which was humorous in depicting our fascination for mumbojumbo (I wonder if she is in league with Deepak Chopra?). Nope, sorry, I just can't swallow this whole theory of the importance of mythological characters.  Greed, technology, media have ALWAYS been important to people.  The way many of the mythological gods are treated seems a little too precious as well.  There really wasn't much of a reason to care about the protagonist either.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Hard to care about</td><td>2.0</td><td>American Gods has an imaginative premise and the writing is fairly good, and I have given it points on that aspect, however one must be well versed in suspension of disbelief in that the characters have little resemblance to real people and the convoluted murkiness of plot requires great perseverance to achieve much reward. While you may gather this sort of story is not my usual cup of tea, I have had others whose opinions I value tell me they enjoyed it immensely, and therefore perused it. I find it always difficult to remain objective when the object of discussion, a book or movie, is experienced in a subjective fashion. My antipathy to this particular novel was engendered rather soon by the protagonist's depiction as an ex-con who seemed emotionally blocked in certain areas and fixated in others, yet for all his pragmatic experiences in prison and solid grounding in reality, he accepted with equanimity the most bizarre turn of events that defied all logic, even if couched in a Lord of the Rings setting. I realize this is a fantasy story, but still, when dealing with humans, one must assume there is such a thing as a normal reaction response to outrageous incidents. Shadow's lack of normal reactions seemed to remove him from concern by the reader, in other words, you just don't care what happens to him. And, while I can accept the conceptual fantasy idea of ancient Gods being worshiped in olden times and other lands and actually living among humans, I find it difficult to rationalize them working in, say, a slaugterhouse stunning cattle or running cheap cons to make a living. Either you are a God or you aren't, and if you are, you should be able to avoid such lowly endeavors no matter how many people still believe you exist, otherwise you're just another mundane human with delusions of grandeur. The powers they retained, while minor, still should have enabled them to move out of the slums. And the new breed, hip-hoppers with a bit of magic, seemed a weak effort. But again, I am not a fan of overly-complicated plots that seem to go nowhere nor accomplish much for the majority of the book, no matter how unique the concept or how well they are written. I feel characters should be somewhat realistic so the reader can relate to them in some small manner. However, that said, if you enjoyed King's Dark Tower books, or even The Stand, then you might also enjoy this novel as it follows the general form quite well, a basic good versus evil premise complete with outrageous and eccentric players as seen through a veil of fog that clouds one's ability to make sense of things -as though Lamont Cranston was hiding behind your Lazy Boy as you read. I occasionally felt somewhat like I had wandered into the Winchester House and climbed a series of stairways that ended nowhere, feeling a momentary pang of regret that Ray Bradbury and Poul Anderson aren't still producing the volumes of quality fantasy they once did. -Barker Reviews</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>War of the Gods. It's Hell.</td><td>5.0</td><td>American Gods deserves, for the most part, the Bram Stoker Award for best novel it won earlier this year from the Horror Writers Association. Neil Gaiman's twilight-of-the-gods epic/Great American Novel is a long, rollicking romp that reads like part Dickensian potboiler, part picaresque road novel, and part modern-day apocalyptic fable.  Commendably, it somehow manages to be both fun and ponderous. Gaiman, creator of the Sandman comic series and author of the previous novel Neverwhere, has succeeded where not many dare to venture. Reminiscent of Stephen King's classic good-vs.-evil epic The Stand, American Gods asks what might happen if all of the dead and dying gods from the word's oldest religions were to take one final bloody stand against the modern gods of the Internet, technology and international commerce. The spoils of the war? Our belief, of course. Our hearts and minds. The novel's protagonist is a large, deceptively oafish man named Shadow who has recently been released from prison. No sooner does he gain his freedom than he discovers that both his wife and best friend have just been killed in a gruesome automobile accident. On his plane ride home to attend the funerals, Shadow meets a mysterious older gentleman named Wednesday. The stranger, who might very well be a modern incarnation of an Old Norse God, makes a proposition to Shadow. It's an offer that, despite its dire consequences, Shadow can't refuse. Shadow is a simple man whose unending passion for his dead wife and fascination for card tricks and sleight-of-hand make him a pitiable, almost childlike character. So why, if he has all the appearance of a pawn, is he being treated like a king? For reasons unknown to himself, it soon becomes clear that Shadow will play a major role in this upcoming war of the gods. As the storm of the millennium quickly approaches, he must search inside himself for the fortitude needed to play ball with the big boys. American Gods is really two or three smaller novels sewn together with the sturdy thread of an ambitious premise and some weighty themes that touch on the roots of faith, myth, and the human identity. Some of the pieces prove more successful than others. I enjoyed the small-town horror novel stuck in the middle of this large dark fantasy epic, but felt it threw a snag in the pacing. And yet even the weaker aspects of this large novel can't detract much its overall force. Writing a book like American Gods is like pointing out to the bleachers when you step up to the plate. The pressure's on to deliver the goods. So, did Neil Gaiman hit a homer? Did this Brit manage to write the Great American Novel? Let's say the ball hit the top of the fence and bounced over. (I should mention, as an aside, that my paperback copy started falling apart on me when I was about 150 pages in; I tend to be very easy on books, so I wonder if this was a general manufacturing problem, and if other people experienced this as well.)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Annoying main character, waste of time</td><td>1.0</td><td>I thought \"Water for Elephants\" was a fine book so, even after reading the less than glowing reviews here, I decided to read \"Riding Lessons.\" It was about horses and the Kindle Edition was only $2.99, so why not? I couldn't believe someone who wrote something as good as \"Water for Elephants\" could write something as--well, not good--as \"Riding Lessons.\" Unfortunately, I have to agree that the main character, Annemarie Zimmer, is so annoying that halfway through the book I was rather hoping she would fall on her head again and save everyone a lot of grief. In fact, there really wasn't really a likable character in the whole book, except perhaps veterinarian Dan, but he's kind of a wimp, and the Dressage trainer, who is a nice enough guy but why is he even in the story? I think he was supposed to provide some sexual tension (after all, he's French!), but it didn't really work. I actually felt some sympathy for Annemarie's husband, Roger, for enduring 20 years of marriage to this basket case. Sara Gruen has proven that she can craft a very good book, and I'll be interested to see what else she publishes in the future, but I think I will pass on the next Annemarie Zimmer installment.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>A fresh look at Mary Queen of Scots life and loves and plots</td><td>5.0</td><td>In this lively biography John Guy has produced a new, thoughtful, and very well researched, portrait of the much maligned Mary, Queen of Scots.  He has dug up records that have not been used by historians in over 100 years and for the first time fully reviewed all the original documents relating to the death of her husband Darnley and come up with some very interesting results. Mary comes across as an intelligent, well educated, politically astute woman when she finally took her place on the throne of Scotland.  It's often easy to overlook the fact that for close to 5 years she successfully ruled Scotland and its plotting Lords in her own name before the dramatic events which shaped her eventual fate took place.  John Guy successfully puts these years of successful rule in their place and presents a version of the death of her husband Darnley that makes a great deal of sense given the evidence of this event that is still preserved in English archives. Mary's later captive years are dealt with in less detail, but the plots that eventually bought about her death are presented in with insight and detail. This biography has a lot of new information on Mary, and if you are interested in this complex and tragic historical figure then this book is a must, and it will make you re-think some of the assumptions in earlier biographies.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Starts out Great...</td><td>2.0</td><td>You have to be a certain type of reader to enjoy this Gaiman work. I have only read one other of his, \"Neverwhere\" and I recommend that one highly! But this one has soooo many twists and turns, you feel like you are a rat in a giant maze. The main character, Shadow, lacks depth, and Gaiman segways into so many side stories in order to bring the plot together-you tend to feel like, \"Gee, is this ever going to get to the point?\" Overall, I would've rated this higher, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as \"Neverwhere\", the plot is very slow and runs into so many walls, you get a headache reading it! Not to discount Mr. Gaiman's writting skills, he is superb at his craft, but I just couldn't get into this one, and had to force myself to finish it. You can try this one if you want, but I would suggest getting it from a friend or the library.

I am so thankful that it was a library copy because I would be really upset if I had bought this book ... it was a painful novel to read and I just finished it an hour ago. I cannot express my shock that Gruen, who wrote one of the best novels I've read in some time (Water for Elephants) wrote this book. Granted this is her first novel ... and there is promise that she has come a long ways since this book. But this book is a big disappointment. If you love to read about horses and all that, you will be disappointed. This book is about a train wreck of a woman named Annemarie. Annemarie is one of the worst characters ever in the literature world as she is selfish, self-centered, self-pitying and rude. She comes home because she lost her job and her husband wanted to divorce her and plus, she wanted to help her parents since her father was diagnosed with ASL. She ends up driving the family's business into the ground, alienates her daughter even more and instead of resolving her differences with her father who was dying, she just hides in the stables and moan about how hard her life was ever since her accident. This is perhaps the weakest character I have ever come across and I do not say this lightly. She has a horrible meltdown throughout this book and it was very painful to read (I skimmed through a lot of it). Frankly, she comes across as a very spoiled, very priviledged selfish brat. Needless to say that this book is a major disappointment and even though it predictably ends well, the ending doesn't salvage a sour taste that this book has left me with. I read to either learn something new or to escape reality for a few hours ... this book did neither. 11/10/09</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Cheese....and Whine</td><td>2.0</td><td>Skeleton of the plot: The opening scene is an eloquent and exciting description of AnneMarie Zimmer, a nineteen year old girl, and her magnificent striped horse Harry, about to win a prestigious equestrian event. Disaster results, and the story resumes almost two decades later. AnneMarie returns to her family's equestrian center, where her father is dying. There is no question that Sarah Gruen can write, and write entrancingly well. In the case of Riding Lessons, the question is how much stable muck you are willing to wade hip deep through to get to the unlikely conclusion of the story. Not since the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew novels of my childhood have I seen an author telegraph plot twists so enthusiastically, and so much in advance. And not since.....ever, have I felt so much antipathy for the protagonist of a story. AnneMarie's grinding narcissism, belief-defying and adolescent impetuosity, and high decibel wailing, moaning, and whining simply did me in. There is a romantic angle to the plot, pitting a cartoonish pony-tailed French demi-god riding instructor against Dan, the local steadfast all around do-gooder veterinarian (he runs a rescue ranch for horses). By the end of the book, you pity the winner, and yearn to tell him to get LOTS of therapy before letting AnneMarie slip a marital halter over his head. Brief summary: the best part of the book is the glimpse into the inside world of equestrian competition and horse ownership in general, portrayed with lucid and inventive prose. The worst part?

We listened to the end only because it was all we had, and because we developed a fascination with how bad it was, wondering how the author could turn this self-centered,  singularly unappealing character into someone sympathetic who grew and learned by the end. Well, it never happened. She never grew, never became more reasonable, never took an interest in others except how they reflected back on her. In a more mature writer's hands, this might've become a powerful portrait of a totally dysfunctional, tragic character. At some point, we lost all curiosity about how the author would redeem this character, because it was clear she wouldn't. And because she was the narrator, we never learned much of interest about any of the other characters. Eventually, it became a challenge -- could we make it to the end? We agreed if we were reading the book, we both would've tossed it across the room long ago. But we egged each other on, taking turns predicting plot twists and laughing uproariously at the heroine's self-absorbed descriptions of her trials. At the end, we both burst into laughter -- at relief we had made it all the way and at the author's ham-handed romance novel descriptions.

The central idea is an old chestnut -- that gods only live as long as they are believed in.  Gaiman modifies this by tying gods to the land, in a sense, such that gods, or a version of them, move to America when people move there.  But most of these old gods are near death -- few people believe in them anymore.  They live on in rather diminished circumstances. The central character is a man named Shadow.  The book opens as he is about to be released after three years in prison.  Just days before his release, he learns that his wife has died in an automobile accident, and the prison authorities let him go early.  On his way home, he meets a strange man called Mr. Wednesday (the significance of the name, and the man's glass eye, won't escape many people, I trust), who offers him a job.  Shadow thinks he has a job waiting, but he soon finds out that his prospective employer has died. Shadow finds himself more or less pushed to taking Wednesday's job offer.  Mostly this job consists of driving around while Wednesday tries to recruit other old gods to join him. It seems a battle for control of America is coming, between the old gods and the \"new gods\": the media, the internet, and suchlike.  So we meet a number of nicely depicted gods from the various old countries: Anansi from Africa, Bast and Osiris and Anubis from Egypt, Czernobog from Russia; and so on.  Some of the new gods begin to harass Wednesday and his associates, managing to capture Shadow a couple of times.  And Shadow meets his dead wife as well, in the corrupting flesh, and she begs him to find a way to bring her back to life.  We also get some interludes depicting the lives of some of the immigrants to America, as they bring their gods with them. A long middle section finds Shadow hanging out in an idyllic Wisconsin town, in the dead of winter.  Though even there a dark mystery may lie behind the town's peacefulness.  Finally the battle nears, and Shadow finds himself pushed to test his loyalty to Wednesday to the utmost, even into the land of the dead.  He learns some important truths about his own identity, and he learns the real secret behind the coming battle. The story is resolved both cleverly and movingly.  Shadow is both a character who grows during the action, and a character who pays a great price for his knowledge.  The end manages to surprise, as well.  I think this is one of the best SF/Fantasy books of the year.  There may be a few structural loose ends, and also Gaiman pretty much entirely avoids confronting any of the Abrahamic faiths, which seems to me to leave a conceptual hole, but the book is still powerful and involving.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Not as great</td><td>2.0</td><td>I had read this author's first book, Water For Elephants, and just loved it, but was disappointed in this book that I purchased, Riding Lessons.

It's difficult to believe that the two books were actually written by the same author. The main character, Annemarie, at 38 years old, was extremely immature and a total drama queen.

Well, let my say that this is Neil Gaiman's deepest and most impressive work I have read. I read many of his tales, and I believe that there is no author who has his talent for creating modern legends, and modern mythologies. So saying it's his best book should give you a rough idea how much I liked this book. 'American Gods' has a main story, and a back story. The main storyline evolves around Shadow, an ex-con who is hired by an enigmatic character called Wednesday to be his bodyguard. It takes Shadow some time to realize it, but apparently Wednesday is trying to enlist many odd people all around America for a war.. these people, Shadow finds out, are in fact the old gods from various mythologies. The war is a war of old gods against the new gods... gods of the media, computers and the internet. I would not elaborate much on this storyline, because I don't want to ruin it. The back story examines ideas which Neil Gaiman likes to explore.. what is belief? what are gods? what happens to gods when there is not so much belief anymore? The book is filled with ideas and characters from so many mythologies.. I'm sure I missed many of these anecdotes, most are not explained at all. This creates such a deep background. The book has such a feeling of loss, of old passing away, and new things waiting for their own demise..  this held me captivated, I could not put the book down until I finished it. To summarize: I wholeheartly recommend this book - but beware, as it is definitely not light reading.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Another Marian Apologist</td><td>1.0</td><td>It is harder to imagine a woman history has been kinder to than Mary Queen of Scotts. She is always the tragic women, betrayed by those she loved, and executed  by her cruel, vicious, and nefariosu Cousin Queen Elizabeth.

Mary Queen of Scotts knowingly married her second husband's murderer and assented to the murder of Elizabeth who kept Mary alive, albiet in a very comfortable captivity, at great risk to her own [Elizabeth's] life. I don't think Mary, Queen of Scotts is a totally unsympathetic figure; she loved bad men and was betrayed by them. She was betrayed by her half-brother the earl of Moray, and she died with great courage. That said, she is not a flawless saint, no matter how much Guy wishes to make her one. (Also he makes the errenous assumption that if the the casket letters are fake, which he convincingly shows to be forgeries, Mary is automatically vindicated from the murder of her husband. Something on which the evidence is quite inconclusive.) For a more balanced look at Both Queens, I would reccomend both Jane Dunn and Alison Plowden's duel biography.

While I enjoyed Riding Lessons, I had mixed feelings about this first effort.  Overall, I'd give this book three and a half stars. Thirty-eight year old Annemarie Zimmer has her world collapse on her when she loses her job, her husband, and she finds out that her father is dying of ALS.  She packs up her rebellious 15 year old daughter and heads back to the horse farm where she grew up in New Hampshire.  But unfortunately for Annemarie, the farm is haunted by ghosts of her childhood and a tragic riding accident that almost killed her 20 years ago.  She also has never dealt with the loss of her magnificent horse, Harry, who had to be killed as a result of the accident.  Annemarie was a world champion rider, training for the Olympics.  After the accident, she never rode again.  So not only must Annemarie deal with her father and her daughter and her divorce, she must also face the issues from her past. One problem I had with Riding Lessons is that I didn't always like Annemarie.  She seemed spoiled and self-absorbed and every time she was faced with a decision, it seemed like she made the wrong one.  The plot was also fairly predictable--especially the ending.  But Sara Gruen's writing is moving and poignant and it's obvious that her talent will serve her well (as evidenced by Water for Elephants).</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Page turner</td><td>5.0</td><td>I was up until 2 a.m. because I couldn't put the book down at the climax of the story.

Most of this is news to Shadow, the main character in Neil Gaiman's novel, who learns his wife, Laura, has been killed in a car crash just as he was about to get out of prison.  But if you remember one thing about this novel it is that there are no accidents, nothing is coincidence, and everything has meaning.  Shadow, who has a modest talent for doing coin tricks, becomes the employee of a strange being who goes under the name of Wednesday and is warned by everyone he meets or dreams about that a storm is coming.  Soon it becomes clear that this is not an allegorical statement, but that there is a coming battle between the \"new\" gods and the more ancient variety of deity. Ultimately the sum of the parts of \"American Gods\" is not greater than the whole, and when the war of the gods ends with a whimper instead of a bang, it is an unsatisfying climax as is the resolution of Shadow's relationship with his dead wife, Laura.  Gaiman has actually done too good of a job on his research of the ancients gods, so that it becomes difficult to tell whose rules apply; are we dealing primarily with Norse mythology here or is there a more general set of rules that apply?  I am sure some academic can explain it all to us, but do not ask me and while I do not expect to be able to guess where Gaiman is going with his story, I do want to feel that this story is more than slight of hand or some type of con game. The best part of the ending was the truth of the quiet little town of Lakeside; again, the pieces fall into place, this time with a more satisfying sense of conclusion.  \"American Gods,\" despite its problems, most of which can be forgiven since Gaiman is clearly trying to construct an epic, is an interesting tale, well told.  Michael Crichton talked about a paradigm shift in \"Jurassic Park,\" arguing that science no long produces truth; Gaiman touches upon this, but without really developing the new paradigm (and its attendant gods) in significant detail.  However, through out the novel Gaiman's characters consistently captivate us even when the story becomes obscured.  In the end, \"American Gods\" is a good read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Exceptional Writing</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you've read Gaiman's work before, you will recognise many of the themes in this book.  Everything about the nature of Gods -- what they are, where they come from, how they survive, and what happens when they don't -- seems to be of supreme interest to him.  As well, he is often concerned with the relationships between \"common\" mortals and the \"uncommon\" (deity, supernatural forces, etc.)and how that relationship changes a person. Gaiman certainly has the background knowledge to explore these topics!  In fact, much of his work seems to contain less truly original content than it does beautifully arranged and applied folk traditions and mythologies.  But to Gaiman, it seems that everything is a mythology, from tales of the Norse Pantheon to serial killers and black helicopters.  Myself, I see the world that way too, so it's validating to read someone else who does.  People who don't see the world that way, however, can find Gaiman's work long-winded and irrelevant. Gaiman's use of language is one the strongest points of this novel.  He uses no more words than necessary, yet combines them in exquisite pictures like \"Chicago came on slowly, like a migraine.\"  Having read _American Gods_ following a cheesy and bombastic fantasy novel, I was really refreshed! I also really liked that much of the book was set in small towns and out of the way places.  Living in a small town myself, I can say that Gaiman really has a handle on both the charms and oddities of small town America.  It's great to see that given space without being made totally sinister, as King tends to do. Some people have objected to the lack of Christian content in anything with the word \"Gods\" in it.  Similar objections were made to sections of _The Sandman's_ run.  The only thing I can say to this is, if you're a strict monotheist or a religious fundamentalist of any kind, you will probably not like this book, so don't bother. Ditto if you don't like having your idea of the world challenged, or if you just don't find questions about the nature of deity interesting.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>What is it about me and first novels?</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am not kidding I have read so many first novels. This novel is so good it was done in two sittings. I can't wait to read Water for Elephants as well. (Mother never bought me a horse nor an elephant. I will never forgive her!) This story is compared to The Horse Whisperer but it is a more common story. The voice is from the wife/mother. We all are or know wife/mother but not too many whisperers!

I've read each of his other books (Neverwhere, Stardust and Smoke & Mirrors) as they were published and eagerly awaited the next. This is his newest book and, in my opinion, the best thing he's ever done. Bit by bit: Shadow: the book's main character. It begins with his release from a short prison term, a few days early, due to his wife's untimely death. With nothing tying him down, seemingly no reason to even continue living, he accepts a job from a stranger as an aid, chauffer, travelling companion, etc. While Shadow sometimes seems like a bit of a dullard, you can't help but love him. Even following him into places that seem boring, your interest never wanes. Easily the strongest of Gaiman's main characters yet. Wednesday: main supporting character. Shadow's employer. One of the American Gods, and one of fiction's all-time coolest characters. You can't not love Wednesday, even when he comes under fire late in the book. Supporting characters: one of the greatest casts of supporting characters since...well...ever, maybe. At least that i can think of. Anansi, Czernobog, the whole town of Lakeside. The supporting characters make the book just as much fun as any of the other, bigger elements. Atmosphere: in all these reviews, not once does anyone say Gaiman's prose is bad, and with good reason. He's a master at creating atmosphere, and the only times he's ever matched the atmosphere of this book are in Neverwhere and during The Kindly Ones storyline in Sandman. And the settings (Lakeside, Backstage, all the roadside attractions) make the book a lot more fun. All in all, this is one of the greatest books i've ever read. It's up there with Tristan Egolf's \"Lord of the Barnyard: Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt\" and Neal Stephenson's \"Cryptonomicon\". Oh yeah, and \"The Stand\". Read these books, you won't be disappointed.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Flawed but a good read</td><td>3.0</td><td>I like a main character that isn't perfect, but at times I lost patience with this main character whose flaws were so many and so persistent that at times I wanted to throw down the book and scream \"get some therapy people!\"  The plot was engaging however and I ultimately would say it was a good escape read. The horse details were confusing because some were very accurate, especially the physical descriptions of what a horse feels like, but some were so off.  This author seemed to not know the difference between Grand Prix show jumping and eventing.  This really bugged me.  Also, the idea that any 16 year old would compete at  Rolex (FEI 4star) is preposterous, given the number of years it takes to qualify at that level, she would have started eventing at what, age 8???  Like other reviewers I liked the fact that it didn't end with the typical \"win of the big competition against all odds\".  I was also relieved that the author didn't have the main character spring in the saddle after a 20 year absence and take up where she left off.  I spent one year out of the saddle and after my first time back I was walking like Ozzie Osbourne for four days....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Good story, great imagination</td><td>4.0</td><td>I have been a Neil Gaiman fan back to his days doing graphic novels.  Unfortunately, I have found that his prose, while excellent when paired with vivid art, often don't stand up on their own.  American Gods demonstates that he is matureing as an author and growing beyond the need for multi-media. Many reviewers have given far too much of this book away.  That is unfortunate and I will not repeat their mistakes.  The book is intersting and fun.  The philisophical conflicts that it embraces harken back to some of Gaiman's best work in Sandman.  The subject matter is engrossing and his strong central character is one that the reader wants to follow.  While I do not think the writing is great, it is good enough to be entertaining and carry a very imaginative story. Gaiman has a gift for vivid imagry and a seemingly endless collection of interesting factoids that continue to peek the readers interst.  This work represents a leap forward for a matureing author.  As such, it a worthwhile read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Riding Lessons</td><td>5.0</td><td>Wowsers!  What a great book.

As he bids his farewell to the fragments of that life, an eerie stranger named Mr. Wednesday offers him employment.  Wednesday needs someone to act as aid, driver, errand boy, and, in case of Wednesday's death, someone to hold a vigil for him.  Shadow consents and finds himself drawn unsuspectingly into a cryptic reality where myth and legend coexist with today's realities. Mr. Wednesday, trickster and wise man, is on a quest.  The old gods who came over to this country with each human incursion have weakened as their followers have dwindled and are now threatened with extinction by the modern gods of technology and marketing.  Wednesday travels from deity to deity, rounding up help for what will be last battle.  He engages ancient Russian gods, Norse legends, Egyptian deities, and countless others who have found their way to America in the past 10,000 or so years.  Shadow never quite understands what his role is in all of this, but he experiences visions and dreams which promise that he is far more than Wednesday's factotum. The plot is unendingly inventive as it treks its way across the country.  From Chicago to Rhode Island, and Seattle to the magical town of Lakeside, Shadow's journey seems to follow the back roads of America.  The people he meets are gritty, and the gods are even grittier.  Gaiman creates believable characters with quick brush strokes and builds vivid landscapes that belie their mundane origins.  Gaiman, recently moved to the U.S. has invited us along on his own quest to discover an America uniquely his own. This is a novel that resonates at many levels, it is Shadow's initiation quest, Gaiman's search for the American identity, a revisionist Twilight of the Gods, and last, but not least a captivating piece of fiction.  The gods that people this story came with people who found their way to this country from almost every time and place.  Gaiman has put his finger on once of this country's greatest truths.  Every person who ever lived here has roots from somewhere else.  We have crossed oceans and land bridges, on foot, and by every other means of transportation.  Our culture has been created whole cloth out of the character and beliefs of all those people.  Gaiman has managed to capture a bit of that vision and put it on display for the reader. After his superb work in \"Neverwhere,\" \"Stardust,\" and the Sandman graphic novels, Neil Gaimon has established himself a force to be reckoned with in the crossover horror/fantasy genre.  Now with his new novel Gaiman establishes his mastery in a remarkable story of quest and transformation as he comes to terms with his own vision of America.  \"American Gods\" defies classification and invites superlatives.  This is one of 2001's must reads.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>a solid story</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've read comparisons of Neil Gaiman with Stephen King.  The comparison, I think, is unfair.  Both are good storytellers with a deft mastery of language and imagery.  However, unlike King, Gaiman does a much better job at taking us into that which lies beneath.  King only shows what is there (at least, what is there in his fantastic horrible world).  Gaiman takes us behind the scenes -- even, in this book, referring to it as Backstage. That difference may seem trivial, but it is very important.  It makes Gaiman's work more readable, more interesting, more thought-provoking. Gaiman loves looking at that which lies beneath, and \"American Gods\" is no exception.  This time around, he examines American belief in the form of the gods that were brought to this new land but, ultimately, were abandoned for the new gods of technology and pop culture.  We follow Shadow, an ex-con with a dead wife, through various American roadside attractions and through the living quarters of the old gods.  We watch as the final battle between the old and new builds up.

Sara Gruen's RIDING LESSONS is so explosive that not only was I hooked immediately, I lost a night's sleep to finish it. I became so immersed in Annemarie's life that I was saddened when I reached the end of her story. Gruen writes with astonishing grace about several difficult issues. Her depiction of the power struggle between Annemarie and her daughter is rendered with empathy, and thankfully avoids relying on melodrama or syrupy platitudes. Annemarie's parents are vital, vibrant characters, so alive and skillfully realized you feel like you're eavesdropping on private, painful conversations. Gruen also exhibits a biting sense of humor, imbuing Annemarie with a sharp wit and fragile bravado that leads her into several comical situations. And the sequences about riding can only be described as breathtaking. RIDING LESSONS is so exquisitely written I often found myself stopping to reread sentences, just to enjoy their structure and cadence. I urge anyone who's tired of the same old stale, formulaic women's fiction to read RIDING LESSONS; I promise it'll restore your faith in the genre. I eagerly await Gruen's next effort.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Nice Addition to Series</td><td>4.0</td><td>I read \"The Beatrice Letters\" twice - I read it before \"The End\" the last book in Lemony Snicket's Unfortunate Series of Events and I read it again after reading \"The End\". I enjoyed the word play in the book the first time I read it, especially in the letter where Snicket tell Beatrice how long he will love her. Snicket also has great fun with the word \"letter\" as in letters of the alphabet and letters you write, often mixing the two until the reader is thoroughly confused. There are tons of anagrams (some obvious and some not) as well as codes. Even the front cover has some hidden clues. There are supposedly thirteen clues in the book, I'm not sure that I found them all. But \"The Beatrice Letters\" was much more enjoyable the second time I read it because I could see how cleverly Snicket hinted at events to come in \"The End\". I was initially puzzled by the seeming differences between the letters Lemony Snicket was writing to Beatrice and the letters Beatrice was writing to Snicket - which was explained in \"The End\". Other things that are casually mentioned in \"The Beatrice Letters\", such as a ring, turn up in \"The End\". Finally, the back cover itself is a direct, humorous reference to the last book. Fans of Lemony Snicket don't have to read \"The Beatrice Letters\" to enjoy the Unfortunate Series, but it's a nice addition. There are hints as to what happened to the Baudelaires later in life, but there are also plenty of mysteries created and unsolved; a Lettergram in the book is especially intriguing. I can't help wondering if we have indeed heard the last from Snicket about the Baudelaires.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Got a little more than I expected here...</td><td>5.0</td><td>I like the disc world books. They're just fun. But this was kind of a cut above the others I've read. It got me thinking. The books central theme was the difference between male and female magic. In the disc world (and possibly elsewhere) magic is a kind of ATP driving the universe forward. Female magic emphasizes harmony among people and harmony between people and nature. It has a pantheistic basis. Male magic is intrusive. It changes things, even though a change in one direction means a possibly undesirable motion in other directions. So the question I asked myself is: are there really differences between male and female creative urges? The book argues that there are such differences and you can ascribe a gender identity to each. It's just that men and women can be \"transgender.\" That doesn't mean that their activities are not \"inherently\" masculine or feminine. But I don't quite buy off on that. I think there are behavioral differences between men and women (in addition to anatomical differences.) But in the behavioral case, the differences are more imposed on us, and defined by society. We act like boys and girls because the \"meme\" for such behavior is transmitted to us by the people around us when we reach consciousness. If all of a sudden, we made an active decision to change these notions of what constitutes male or female action, we could and no rule of physics or chemistry would be violated. Its like the gender endings in German, For example masculine, feminine and neutral endings don't always appear logically assigned. This illustrates their arbitrary nature. So it is with what we call male or female roles. All this is a bit of an \"extra\" for escapist reading.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic, though it's not necessary to have read them ...</td><td>4.0</td><td>After reading the first two thoroughly delightful Discworld novels, I decided to plow ahead with this one and commit to the whole series. This book is set some time after the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower from the first two novels, The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic, though it's not necessary to have read them first, and a quick introduction is enough to situate a reader in the Discworld universe. (For that matter, Pratchett fans have suggested countless Discworld reading orders other than the usual order of publication.) Though the action of the story focuses on young Eskarina Smith's efforts to become Discworld's first female wizard, the real standout character is her mentor Granny Weatherwax, a formidable rural witch who disapproves of wizardry but nonetheless supports Esk's choice to travel to the city of Ankh-Morpork and apply for admission to Unseen University. The story moves along at a good clip and is filled with Pratchett's trademark humor; he's like a witty, fantasy counterpart to Douglas Adams, though perhaps with less wryness and more warmth in his writing. In terms of reading level and content appropriateness, I'd say it's fine for precocious middle schoolers and up, and it's a pretty fast read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Entertaining</td><td>3.0</td><td>At the outset, the author is not afraid to use language largely avoided today because of political correctness -- bravo to him.  Additionally, it's a nice trip down memory lane.  It is quite fun to run around Boston with the characters, but when it comes to the outlying Massachusetts towns, the author finds it necessary to create fictional place names -- why?  I also found this to be the case with William Martin and it drives me insane.  The central character, Patrick Kenzie, can be self-important and vain-glorious and, at times, unrealistic.  Whereas, real crimes do occasionally take place on the Boston Common, one doesn't see people shooting up the place with an Uzi, nor does one witness a real life detective blowing people away just because he doesn't agree with the individual's criminal mentality.  William Tapply wrote a host of Brady Coyne novels set in Boston that are a tinge more in line with reality, if one is interested.

Each has a distinct personality and the story uses flashbacks and their relationships to describe how they developed into adulthood. Identical twins Lyn and Cat are seemingly opposites in personality. Lyn is a perfectionist, hard driven to always do the right thing. Hot tempered and snarky Cat does what she pleases without thought to consequence, and Gemma, the fraternal sibling, floats through life trying to keep everybody happy. Their lives are entwined because of their closeness as siblings, and when a series of events unfold, their worlds spark and collide with anger, humor, and tenderness. I loved this books and found myself enjoying the antics of the three madcap sisters. At times, laugh out loud funny, the story equally tugged my heartstrings. All three sisters find their lives upended and must dig deep to find the honesty of their existence. Each is faced with examining the direction of their life and the soul searing examination if they stayed true to their dreams.

As a self described journeyman cook who is still trying new recipes that don't call for the inclusion of Cream of Mushroom Soup, the recipes in this book present a challenge to me.  Am I a little intimidated?  You betcha.  But in a good way.  Recipes such as Oxtail Consomme with Sherry and Osso Buco with Fennel and Blood Orange Sauce can do that to a budding cook like me. I think we tend to extract bones from our kitchens because they remind us only too well that we're preparing and eating a dead animal.  Those neatly wrapped packages we get at the grocery store or butcher don't confront us with the reality of the carnage that we're consuming.  Our fore-mothers would laugh at us and would never recognize most of what the grocery store stocks these days.  I decided there was something wrong with the way I looked at meat and bought Bones because I wanted to get back to basics and tradition.  I wanted to find ways to infuse my meals with flavor and complexity without breaking the bank or using a plethora of exotic ingredients. The layout of this book makes sense and is easy to navigate.  However, I really wish that the editors has chosen to invest in more color photography.  There are a few pictures here and there, but with a sophisticated topic such as this, I believe that they missed an opportunity to really showcase bones actually in use as ingredients.  The book feels as if it were published on the cheap which is really too bad given the audience it actually targets.  The paper itself is too pulpy & porous and retains moisture only too easily in the kitchen environment. Covering all the varieties and classes of meats, Bones delivers an education as well as a culinary challenge.  The stock recipes alone are worth their weight in gold.  There is even a small section at the back that discusses the use of marrow in desserts and even a few recipes such as Marrow Pudding and Bone Cookies.  There is much to be learned between the covers of this book and I highly recommend it to cooks of all abilities.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Boring --- Did not finish</td><td>1.0</td><td>This was the second and last book I have read by the author.  I am so tired of diva whiny women.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Exciting Enough, but Exceedingly Light and Inaccurate in Many Places</td><td>3.0</td><td>Burma Road is really not a book about the Burma Road. It is a general and light overview of the entire Burma War. It's focus is primarily centred around the American contribution. But the great problem with this book is that the general reader would assume by its contents that America and all its actions in this war were the central actors in this Theatre. The million-person Anglo-Indian Army -- which cleared all of India in almost all of the major battles of this war is clearly underexplained. In this sense, altough a worthy effort, merely reinforces popular American mythology of how they \"won\" in this theatre of the war -- and does nothing to advance a higher understanding of how a Japanese Army of 300,000 (more than double that encountered by the American's on Okinawa) was defeated. If Donovan had started with the premise that this book was to be about the Burma Road and its place in the Burma War (as I assumed from the title of the book), then most of the battle detail is strong and certainly interesting. But in fact Webster tries to paint from a pallette describing the entire war in Burma, emphasising overwhelmingly the American contribution. While the battles leading up to the capture of Mytkiyina were brutal and certainly exciting, they are mere sideshows compared to those of Imphal, Kohima, Shaggy, Myktiela and the battle of the Pegu Yomas at the end of the war. The action and descriptions fly a little too fast and furious for my liking as well. Orde Wingate is described  (before being appointed to head special warfare unit) as the \"most controversial officer in the British Army\" -- which outside of the people who knew him was clearly not the case -- he was a minor oddball Colonel (and sometimes Major, and largely unknown) until Wavell, Slim and later Churchill picked him for greater things. There is an almost 1950s narrative history feel about his book. All battles are \"hell,\" all moves by the allies \"brilliant\" and the Japanese (perhaps the finest light infantry in the world) just a bunch of ham- fisted Banzai-charging fanatics. The situation of the Chindit defence of Blackpool was \"perfectly\" positioned -- which as any reader of history at this time knows be exactly the opposite of reality (see Michael Calvert's \"Prisoners of Hope\"). Donovan has clearly not done his elementary study of the Burma war to get this wrong. More than a few British officers lived with the infamy of the poor siting of Blackpool. Some of the narrative is factually incorrect. We have Webster numbering Japanese troops in a division to \"1000 men\" (moreover he does this at least twice in the book?!). We have him describing Mountbatten as the leader of the \"highly successful raid on Dieppe\"??? Again -- Donovan is writing about things he clearly has not read. He states that the war in Asia started on December 10th?? (Actually it started on the 08th). He states that, even as the Japanese were advancing into Burma, they were losing much tonnage as a result of the Flying Tigers (AVG) flying over the South China Sea and bombing shipping headed for Burma (again totally factually incorrect). Much later in the war the 23rd Fighter Group made raids over Hanoi, but at the beginning stages of the Burma battle the AVG never sunk a single ship.( I think that he is mixing up the missions of the AVG with the latter, much larger 10th and 14th USAAF units that certainly did wreek havoc over SE Asia). A reference to Brian Cull's \"Bloody Shambles\" - a history of air operations over Burma (or any standard study of the war) -- would have sorted him out on this point, but its not in the bibliography. In addition the massive Royal Airforce which included airmen and women for all over the commonwealth is not even mentioned. This theatre was even more complicated that others, but the intracies of this are not explained at all. In fact the Burma Road itself would have been a excellent vehicle to compare, contrast and describe the wranglings over strategy and command splitting that went on in this front. A person reading this book would be forgiven if they thought that Stillwell was Supreme Theatre Commander or even subordinate to anyone outside the US Chain of command. He in fact reported to Archie Wavell (though he did break the chain of command quite frequently). Most importantly, Webster seems to have talked with a lot of people about his subject. But by the paltry bibiography he has clearly not mastered the literature of his study: how anyone could write a book on the Burma War and not cite Louis Allan's \"Burma: The Longest War\" is beyond me. He also uses compendium Secondary Sources such as Chinnery's \"March or Die\" and Rooney's \"Burma Victory.\" The latter is again an overview book and extremely prejudicial in favour of Orde Wingate,but both do not include any original reasearch on the war. Most of the information on Stillwell was gleaned from Barbara Tuchman's tour de force \"Stillwell and the American Experience in China\" -- which gives you a better feel for the man, the campaign and the politics of this theatre. The one area I give Webster his due, is that he sorts out the niave American interpretation of the Chindits and Stillwell's opinion that \"limey's do not fight\" -- Webster explains excruciating Chindit battle for Moguang, who, unlike their American cousins, fought for four months, many times with no direct support. From 1200 fighters Brig. Michael Calvert emerged with almost 50 effectives at the end of the battle. The clearing of the Hunkwang valley was only a sideshow. In the end the British cleared all of lower Burma from offensives launched out of the Akyab corridor and the Imphal plain -- all with traditional army units (including the last Chindit operation). They cut Burma in half and forced the Japanese to withdraw from Northern Burma before utterly destroying the Japanese in the brilliant battle of Myktiela. This does not mean the honour or sacrifices of those who fought the Northern campaigns is any less than those of others -- it does however seem to vindicate British strategy. Do not get me wrong. I liked the book, but this description of the Burma War is only a very small exciting part of a very, very large war that dwarfs many of the personalities and events in this book. It is an exciting series of battles and personalities. But in sum the American contribution was local, and contributed little in the defeat of Japan in Burma. That it was glorious is beyond quesion. For those who want to know more about the Marauders I reccomend Orgill's book of the same name. For those about the American contribution on what the Americans call the CBI (not used outside of the US I'm afraid), you couldn't do better than Tuchman's \"Sand Against the Wind.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A good solid read if you're a fan of the genre</td><td>4.0</td><td>Overall I'd say this was a pretty good book as a historical war record.  It shines the light on an oft forgotten theatre in WWII and dissects both the political and military aspects with clarity.  Even as a self-professed WWII history buff many of these details were not known by me.  So, for that I'd have to give this book high marks simply for the depth of information on this mostly unknown piece of WWII history.  The background on General Stilwell is of particular interest as the man who stubbornly ran the war against all odds.  Stilwell's army constantly faced a multitude of diseases, lack of supplies, horrible climatic conditions and a relentless enemy and the book covers these in detail, from dysentery to flying supplies over the \"hump\" to first hand accounts of Japanese banzai charges.  Handcuffed by U.S. military planners and General Chiang Kai-shek policies, Stilwell shows his mettle and does a superb job of getting things done with the little resources he had available.  I found it especially interesting that the author notes that Gen. Stilwell had first been selected to lead the D-Day invasion of Europe, but because of his unique qualifications he was chosen for the Burma-India theatre with Eisenhower instead leading the invasion or Normandy.  Could we perhaps have had a President Stilwell if he had overseen D-day and not Ike?  Some of the guerilla warfare with details of firefights was especially engaging.  At times however the book did bog down and get a bit dry with all the \"logistical\" details and I had to slog my way past that.  But, in the end it was a satisfying book.  If you're a history, military and/or political science fan, then this book is right up your alley.  If you only have a general interest in the topic, I'd probably recommend you pass.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Reads like a longer book...</td><td>5.0</td><td>I was going to watch the movie \"The Town\", and then realized it was a novel first. So I looked it up, and found too many references to Lehane in the reviews of Hogan's work to ignore. I really liked the movie version of Lehane's 4th book, so I figured I would read about the beginning of these character's story. Let me say that my favorite books are usually epic, character driven stories. Stephen King, George R.R. Martin, Follett are among my favorites. I pick up 300-400 page novels as filler in between heavy, long stories. I enjoy and appreciate short, plot driven stories, but usually don't expect too much from them. That may be why or how I enjoy them so much. It's a quick break. Fun, or scary, or intense. I just want to feel something. I say all of this to frame my review of this book, give perspective. This may be the best 300 page novel I've ever read. It has the pacing you would expect from a short novel, but somehow the characters are much deeper than the typical short novel. I feel more connected to the characters than the plot, which is usually only accomplished in a much longer novel or series of novels. Lehane is very good at using minimal words for maximum impact. A very fast read that leaves you with the feeling you have after finishing an \"epic\" novel. I'll be reading the rest of Lehane's work in very short order.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Inutterably tedious</td><td>2.0</td><td>Lehane is no Raymond Chandler. This book is short on dialogue and short on action.  90 per cent of the inexcusably long 400 pages consists of self indulgent and tedious narrative. Every stray thought from every character who wanders into the book is unloaded onto the hapless reader. It is full of teenage angst and false passion. Having purchased the audio book version, I had to further endure the over excited narrator's lapses when his 3rd generation Irish characters mysteriously developed Belfast Irish accents (BBC version).</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Thoroughly enjoyable.</td><td>5.0</td><td>I was glad I had the opportunity to knock this book over in a couple of days. He's nicely captured the hardboiled thing, more Hammett than Chandler in the over the top level of constant danger and violence. Also no coincidence that there's a deliberate Western influence (Hammett wasn't shy of knocking out a Western alongside his crime stories, such as the excellent `The Man Who Killed Dan Odoms'), Lehane foregrounding this as his heroes head out into their high noon shootout with a couple of wisecracking cops saying, `They think they're cowboys.' `Then we'll bury them with their boots on.' Just about everyone is that much larger than life, tough hombres with gallows wit. `Bubba' is that much larger again, the sort of cartoon character that would be at home in a Terry Pratchett novel, but mostly Lehane keeps the comic thing secondary to the dark mood. The cast and plot are genre fiction staples down to their DNA, but that's just fine - Lehane successfully celebrates lots of the things I love about how you can play with this tradition. A total deal-breaker with this is you've got to be able to deliver one-liners, and Lehane gets this essential nicely. Very interesting, too, how he deals with the race thing. This has become a convention lately, probably because of the interplay of TV with books. Cop shows have had mandatory `people of colour' working (surprisingly happily) alongside white folks since the 70s. While tokenism is still rampant, some textures have been allowed to emerge over time (and this novel has far more in common with, say, `The Shield', than Starsky and Hutch's `Huggy Bear' - or the casual perfection of a `Bones' universe). The race issue is given more time, as an issue that isn't necessarily driving the crime story, than anything, with a few barely veiled editorials contained in some of the dialogue. Yet while he does give some strong lines challenging race as an excuse, he also has great relish in giving some rednecks a right kicking. I like that there's lots unresolved here, even within the hero. This is a messy area, and while Lehane condemns some extremes on both sides, he leaves it messy. And he does nothing like the appallingly twee condescension of Mark Giminez' awful `The Color of Law'. This book has so many merits I'll forgive him the almost satirical level of sexual tension: at times I felt like I was watching a `Flying High' type rip-off as yet another perfectly timed phone call, rap on the door or gunshot diverts the girl and boy millimetres away from falling into each other's arms. Is he going to maintain this for the whole series? Absurdly he might - just because sexual tension is more fun than stable relationships. Gennaro is clearly fictional but successful in her combination of vulnerability, impossible desirability, and raw courage. Her abusive marriage (spoiler) sub-plot does deliver the pleasure of a cracker come-uppance scene, but how Phil has survived until then while causing the ire of, what, half a dozen of the most dangerous badasses in the city, is a total mystery. Whatever, sign me up, I'll be back for more of this.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Great book -- but the Kindle edition is terrible!</td><td>1.0</td><td>My rating is not based on the content of the book, this is specifically about the quality of the Kindle edition--or lack thereof! Evidently, this book was scanned into the computer with cheap OCR (optical character recognition) software and no effort was made to spellcheck or proofread. I estimate that there was at least one error per page (or Kindle \"screenful\"), which is ridiculous--that is significantly more than most free Kindle books taken from Project Gutenberg, for example. To give you an idea of what errors to expect: - page numbers are frequently found glommed onto the end of words, like \"with124\" - apostrophes are almost never recognized, so the software ends up interpreting them as part of a letter, so compound words like \"I'll\" become \"Tll\" I might expect this low quality from free or 99-cent ebooks that were ripped from public domain sources and thrown together by an amateur, but not from a Kindle book with a regular price over $5 (even with the occasional sale price of $2).

I love characterization in books, and Mystic River has it in spades.  At least a half-dozen characters are so well defined that now, having read the book, I feel I almost know them and how they'd reaction to happy, sad and tragic events.  Most authors can't paint more than a character or two that clearly. Long passages about the atmosphere -- in this case, a rough neighborhood in a tough city -- usually leave me cold.  Lehane knows how to draw a vivid picture without falling in love with his pen.  I came away feeling like I'd visited the Flats. I don't know if there's a sequel, but if there is I'll read it.  No spoilers here, suffice it to say I'd be interested in any of several story lines that could be further explored.  That's not to say the story's not complete though.  I hate a mystery that doesn't have a proper ending.  The resolution here is logical, unpredicted (by me, anyway), true to what came before, and satisfying. I've not seen the movie based on this book.  The images in my head are already so rich I don't think I'll watch the flick. As far as the Kindle conversion itself, there are no complaints whatsoever.  It probably benefits from being a more recent book, so the source files could be used to produce the Kindle version rather than oft-error prone OCR mechanism.  That or it actually got an editing/proofreading pass (!?!).  Full credit on the Kindle version.

I have been in the Boston area for quite some time, so all of the locations are at least somewhat familiar, but I think that just added to my appreciation for stories that were already fine suspense/action fiction.

The boy's  father is such a hot item, in fact, that the neighborhood kids pass him  back and forth, making one deal after another.  Eventually, the mother  sends the boy and his little sister to recover their father (\"The very  idea,\" she says), and they follow the swapping trail, redistributing the  trade items as they go.  \"The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two  Goldfish\" is a brilliantly illustrated adventure map that navigates  the relative values and the strange economy of childhood.  Neil Gaiman's  lively text is written with that special children's logic and fresh humor  found in classics like \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" and \"Peter Pan,\" and the rich  texture of Dave McKean's images--vivid line drawings and colorful  montages--gives the story a look that is unique in children's literature.

The sighting of an innocent  woman leaving a hotel one Sunday morning sets off a chain of events and false perceptions in the days before the Depression no one could have predicted.  Evoking the era of the Jazz age and those heady days of Jay Gatsby, it as if Edith Wharton met the women from Sex and the City.  When it comes to historical fiction and the pulse of Manhattan society in those days, nobody does it better than Amy Ephron.

Jimmy is the bold and daring leader, the bad influence. Dave is happy just to be a part of the threesome, never quite feeling like he is worthy of their friendship and continuously strategizing to keep his place among the trio.  They are all eleven years old. One day two men posing as police stop the three boys from fighting in the street.  It is no surprise that Dave is the one ultimately lured into their car.  This incident had me thinking... Yes, the fact that Dave got into the backseat of that car certainly resulted in changing his life.  However, if it wasn't that particular incident, there would have been another similar incident, because that was who Dave was.  Hence this question: Can a minor decision change the entire direction of your life?  Or, on the other hand, does who you are direct and mandate the changes and direction that your life takes? Twenty-five years later, Sean is a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-con; married with three daughters, and Dave is married and trying to stay on the straight and narrow, striving to live up to the image of a good-husband and good-father. Over the years, like many childhood friends, they have taken separate paths and the three had lost almost all of their childhood connections.  When Jimmy's nineteen-year-old daughter is murdered, that changes. In my opinion, this was a terrific book, definitely worthy of five stars.  I absolutely loved how Dennis Lehane got inside his characters heads; he brought them to life like no other author that I know of can.  Was it the best book I've ever read?  No.  It was good, however, it could have been better, it could have been, Child 44 better, if it weren't such a downer.  I'm not saying that I need 500 pages of sunshine and lollipops, but the end of this book left me with the same depressing feeling as the beginning.  The boys themselves hardly changed at all as grown men.  That may have been the whole point the author is trying to make:  Life is a perpetual cycle of, poverty, abuse, hate and anger, and for the fortunate ones a cycle of love, luck, and abundance mixed with abuse, hate etc.  The author leaves you with very little hope that these cycles can be broken.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Immature sophmoric 8th grade thinking</td><td>1.0</td><td>Every time I wander into my local Barnes & Noble, I am amazed at the quantity of books for sale by people who have no more credentials than your local kid behind the counter at Blockbusters.

Poor kid who wrote this is proud that he hasn't got laid at the age of 22 (like Brook Shields and Britney Spears before him, he'll come to cringe at the immaturity of his printed words in future years), and then goes on to write a chapter on sexual mores for an adult reading public.  He shows what a sheltered conservative life he's lived in the South where he was raised, where NASCAR racing, and Hillary Clinton-bashing are the favorite local sports.  His understanding of the world is limited to the Bush administration's characterization of \"freedom-lovin' Americans VS. the terrorists\", and his ignorance of other cultures, religions, and ways of life are apparent in page after page of this trite book.

He stands by a bunch prinicipals which don't hold any real value for most Americans.  Absolutely none of his arguments were new (espeacially the ones against gun control) and he supports leaders such as Rumsfeld and Bush simply because he can relate to their good old southern values, even calling Bush a \"hick\" he can be proud of because he knows how to speak to a man about fixing a tractor (but he's sure good at dividing a country and destroying the people of Iraq). The book is simple to read because it offers nothing new to anyone who actually has the desire to read it.  A young middle school student might be able to appreciate it, but they are going to be quick to realize Ferguson is a child of homeschooling (oh!  but he does play tennis!) and not someone they can relate to at all.

Most of her points arguing for the identification of the mummy, \"The Younger Woman\" in the tomb designated KV35, were published years ago by Marianne Luban, whom Fletcher fails to mention in her book.  Fletcher has a good deal to say about ancient wigs, her specialty, but has no way of proving that the wig she claims was found with the three mummies in the tomb even belonged to the mummy in question even though she makes much of this wig.  Nor does Fletcher give any scientific proof that the two unattached right arms associated with the mummy actually belong to it.  So, her \"theory\" not even originally belonging to \"her\", Fletcher has added nothing that can add any true weight as proof of \"The Younger Woman\" being Nefertiti.  Whatever her \"search for Nefertiti\" consists of--and this is a pretty ambiguous if not downright perplexing statement--it can hardly have anything to do with locating the mummy as that has been in the tomb for all these years since being discovered by Victor Loret in the 19th Century.  If one wants to learn about the life of the beautiful queen, there are certainly other books that address this much more comprehensively and Fletcher has nothing original to say about the life and times of Nefertiti, either.  Fletcher also fails to comment on the many criticisms her colleagues have asserted against her since she first announced that she had \"discovered Nefertiti\" in 2003 and evidently, outside of monetary gain, still hopes that she will be remembered as the one who found the mummy of the queen, even though chances of this happening are far slimmer than Joann Fletcher indicates in her book.

Of course her \"trade marks\" remain in place:  A great story, a strong hero, a strong heroine and scorching love scenes.  THE HUNTER made me laugh, sigh and say \"Oh My God!

There are some nice pictures and illustrations included, but generally I wouldn't recommend it if you are actually interested in seeing some proof that the mummy discovered is the long lost Queen Nefertiti.  For one thing, the author contradicts herself on more than one occasion when it comes to her supposed \"proof,\" and it is clear she had already made up her mind who the mummy was long before she ever even saw it.  As a fun read about how this woman got into her chosen career it's a good book, but otherwise rather lacking on both science and logic and has an obvious bias and agenda.

In this way Dr, Fletcher really helps us to visualize the vast scale of the Pyramids.  She's no Ivy Compton Burnett when it comes to dialogue, but you do get the picture of a young woman who's deeply in love with archaelogy and with the romance of discovery. If the mummy in question turns out to be the legendary Nefertiti, then we will all have greater access to one of the most romantic figures of all time, one who had a great influence on 20th Century fashions.  Think of Liz Taylor in Cleopatra! I am no expert on ancient Egypt but after reading this wonderful book I feel I have a better grip on the issues that surround archaeology at the present time, and you can't take that away from every book.

I avoided this book for a time for that reason. After finally reading it, I think my initial instincts were still on the money. There is much to like in this book, but, in attempting to summarize the Irish American criminal experience in America from the time of the Potato Famine to the present day, the author proved himself to be overly ambitious. Trying to tackle the criminal and political history of multiple cities (Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, New Orleans and New York), analyzing the Kennedy family political dynasty and its reputed ties to the underworld, plus examining the activities of Irish labor unions proved to be too much. There is enough information in \"Paddywhacked\" to form the basis of three or four separate books. Sometimes, less is more. Another problem is that the author repeats many historical errors found in other books. English makes numerous misstatements about various topics due to the questionable sources that he has chosen.  Relying upon a wildly inaccurate book such as Kenneth Anger's bitchy and entertaining \"Hollywood Babylon\" as a source for information about the Kennedys does not inspire too much confidence. That title has been properly dismissed as a supermarket tabloid. One unintentionally funny feature of the book is that the text was not edited by a thorough proofreader. The pages are filled with numerous spelling errors. Catholics do not worship at an \"alter\" nor do \"precinct captions\" organize people into \"voting blocks.\" A writer named English should familiarize himself with the English dictionary and language before seeking to recount the criminal activities of the Irish. Some of the historical interpretations are similarly suspect. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was quite comfortable with accepting the support of labor union thugs and machine politicians and was less of a reformer than the author suggests. It was not irregular or unusual for Judge Samuel Seabury, a genuine reformer, to continue to be addressed by his former judicial title after leaving the bench. It is an accepted custom within the legal community. One of the wildest assertions, however, is that the New Deal ushered in an era of reform that effectively ended political corruption and graft and sounded the death knell for the Irish engaged in machine politics. Mister English clearly is not familiar with the governing class that has been mismanaging Chicago, Illinois for the past eighty years or so. There are some terrific yarns in this book and you will not be disappointed if you do not expect too much. \"Paddy Whacked\" is entertaining, but not completely accurate historically.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Clever and heart-wrenching</td><td>5.0</td><td>Few authors are as capable as Lehane.  Possessing stellar technical skills and a grand story-telling vision, he's put together something special with _Mystic River_. Dave, Jimmy and Sean are three Boston kids bound together by a single event: the abduction of Dave by sexual predators posing as cops.  Fast forward to the present; Dave is married and struggling with marginal employment; Jimmy is an ex-con trying to make it as a citizen with his ownership of a corner market; and Sean is a homicide detective. The three find their lives brought together and -- simultaneously -- torn asunder by the abduction and murder of Jimmy's oldest child Katie.  A beautiful, vivacious 19 year old, Katie has been shot and viciously beaten after her attacker chased her into a nearby park.  In the wake of the murder, none of the three former playmates will ever be the same. Lehane has beautiful writing ability, as evidenced by this single sentence describing a neighborhood party. \"Some of the guys who ran the card game in the back of the Pork Chop Brothers' store  brought out a folding table and a small grill, and pretty soon someone else carted  out some coolers filled with Schlitz and Narragansett, and the air turned fat with the smell of grilled hot dogs and Italian sausage, the wafting, smoky, charred smell and the whiff of open beer cans making Jimmy think of Fenway Park and summer Sundays and that tight joy you got in your chest when the adults kicked back and acted more like kids, everyone laughing, everyone looking younger and lighter and happy to be around each other.\" Aside from a couple of necessary contrivances that tighten up the story, there is little to criticize.  Lehane is one of a select few who are completely at the top of the writing game.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Tedious, unrealistic prose</td><td>2.0</td><td>I could have liked the book if the prose wasn't so overdrawn.  The characters are blue collar but the prose doesn't fit. For example, Jimmy is sitting alone on his front porch of his three decker the night his daughter was found murdered.  The night was quiet.  This is the way Lehane draws Jimmy's perception of the night:  \"The noise that normally ruled the daytime wasn't gone, it was merely sucked up, as if into a pair of lungs, and then held, waiting to be expelled.  He trusted that hush, warmed to it, because it promised the return of the noise, even as it held it captive.

Tons of minority groups, white and otherwise--Blacks, Chinese, Russians, Armenians, Jews, and so on--have been involved in organized criminal activities to one degree or another, but as T.J. English points out in Paddy Whacked, the Irish have one distiction that can never be taken away: they got there first.  English paints a vivid portrait of good old days that weren't always good, starting with the arrival of the first Irish immigrants after the potato famine of the 1840's and continuing through turbulent and violent times that saw the Irish emerge as a prominent force in the American criminal underworld as well as in American society as a whole.  Paddy Whacked tells some highly unpleasant stories about Irish-American history, shedding light on inhuman poverty, ethnic and religious prejudice, violent gang wars, and large-scale political malfeasance, but that doesn't stop it from being mighty entertaining throughout, no matter what your background.  If your view of the Irish is all shamrocks, leprechauns, and green beer on St. Patrick's day, this book should offer up some surprises, as much of what we associate with inner cities today (gangs, colors, drive-by shootings) had its roots at least partially in the Irish enclaves of the 19th and 20th centuries. Starting out in Ireland, English places the history of the Irish-American gangster squarely in the larger context of Irish and American history, tracing the Irish Mob's roots all the way back to the anticolonial societies that sprung up to fight British rule in the Old Country.  According to English, it was in these organizations that some of the most prominent features of the Irish gangster, and the Irish in general for that matter, were formed, from their intense togetherness to their emphasis on secrecy and mistrust of outsiders.  That said, though, the focus of Paddy Whacked is still squarely on its bizarre and diverse group of outlaw protagonists and what their experiences have to show us about the history of the Irish in the U.S., from the blinding poverty of famine-era immigrants (in New Orleans, landowners used the Irish to work the worst jobs on their plantations because THEY CONSIDERED THEIR SLAVES TOO VALUABLE) to their eventual emergence as what English calls \"generic white people\" in the last few decades.  The book describes in great detail how the Irish, starting out as a marginalized and ghettoized minority, managed to make themselves an institution in American life through constant struggle, even if many of them had to go way outside the law to get their piece of the pie.  Much like American pop culture's two best-known Mafia sagas--the Godfather movies and The Sopranos--Paddy Whacked presents the story of the Irish Mob as the embodiment of the shadier side of capitalism in the U.S.  Since the Irish were generally shut out of the mainstream of the American economy in their first few decades of the country, many of them had to turn to all sorts of vice--gambling, prostitution, loan-sharking, and later bootlegging and union scams--along with the creation of political machines in New York and other cities that brought with them massive amounts of corruption, in order to advance.  Interestingly, although English depicts the Prohibition era as an unprecedented boom time for the Irish gangster, he also shows that time as the beginning of his end, as the Irish found themselves increasingly marginalized by a more organized (and arguably more vicious) Italian-Jewish syndicate that steadily took over the organized crime business in most cities, with ridiculous amounts of bloodshed emerging from all the inter-ethnic conflicts that resulted. History lessons aside, the most entertaining aspect of Paddy Whacked is the way English manages to bring his subjects to life through in-depth personal profiles and detailed accounts of their criminal careers.  Starting with the first impoverished street gangs in New York, the Irish Mob encompassed all sorts of characters, from early vice lords and crooked political bosses to prohibition-era rumrunners and hitmen to postwar labor racketeers to the bloodthirsty killers who left swaths of destruction in Boston and New York well into the 1980's.  A lot of these guys emerge in English's telling as friendly enough types, many of them churchgoers who were generous and well-liked among their neighbors, but English doesn't soft-pedal the violence and ruthlessness that brought most of them to their positions in the first place, and he makes it clear that a few of them were just plain crazy or worse (Boston's own Whitey Bulger, especially, emerges pretty clearly as a sociopath, but if you read the previous Black Mass you already knew that).  However, many of the characters English sketches in this book--bootleggers like Owney Madden, Legs Diamond, and Spike O'Donnell, early Chicago vice lord King Mike McDonald, crazed gunman Mad Dog Coll, Kansas City machine boss Tom Pendergast, and disgraced ex-New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, to name a few--still managed to embody all the psychoses, contradictions, and struggles that have marked the long and checkered but largely successful history of the Irish in the U.S.  Ultimately, while English's book is concerned with the darker side of the Irish American experience, the history of the Irish Mob is still set against the backdrop of the eventual emergence of the Irish into mainstream society, even if there's still the occasional Whitey Bulger walking around to serve as a reminder that times weren't always good.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Pitch perfect paddy page turner!</td><td>5.0</td><td>The last true crime book I enjoyed as much was, well, TJ English's The Westies.

Honor, violence, guilt, trauma of youth and revenge frame the story line---and the plot twists are revelations of character. Violence split three friends apart, and it is violence that reunites them over twenty years later. The violence is both physical and psychic. The violence and vengeance have unintended consequences. The characters are complex, enigmatic, ambiguous, perplexing and steeped in Catholic guilt. They come alive from page one with all their flaws, anguish, torment and personal demons. The whodunit is cleverly resolved, but \"Mystic River\" is much more than just a mystery story. Mr. Lehane takes you into the individual minds and souls of the players. You experience their pain, know their motivations as well as their flaws and choices. \"Mystic River\" is unforgettable and is etched in my mind.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>It shares a special place in my heart...</td><td>1.0</td><td>This book holds a very special place in my heart.

I would buy one, I thought, and take it home and expand my view. I saw this book, priced at the then unheard of price of $[...](you could get two paperbacks for that price back then), but I gulped and paid and sped home. Five minutes into reading I got that sickening feeling you get when you find out you've thrown your money away and you'll never get it back. Five minutes more only increased the sickness. I could stomach no more. I put it down. But I had a plan. I took it to Junior High the next day, and walking through the courtyard I took it from my backpack and spun it into the trash. I was immediately cleansed, and though I knew I would never get my money back I felt a rush of joy and lightness at having rid the world of such utter crap. Two good thing came of that event. Before, I treated and thought of books as sacred things. I did no longer. Books are not sacred. Good writing surely is. The second thing that happened is I never read another Vonnegut book. I put more effort into toilet paper than was put into that garbage. Having been treated so cavalierly by V-gut I determined not to be taken in again. No author deserves a second chance if the first contained so little effort. He spits in the face of the reader with this book with an attitude of: You'll read whatever I write because of who I am. Un-so. As a P.S., I opened a copy of B of Crap in the library some 20 years later to see if possibly I had been too immature in my Jr. High days and perhaps something of worth could be found within the pages. With pride at the profound insight of that young boy, I closed the book minutes later and put it back, assured that my first assessment had been correct. A piece of crap.

Honestly, I thought the story was quite boring and although I desperately wanted to get into it, I couldn't.  The story was plodding and the book was filled with so much extra filler that it seemingly could have been cut in half. Cliches and stereotypes abound and it felt like Lehane used them to makeup for his lack of \"street\" knowledge.  It was like watching a poorly made TV show or a made-for-TV movie on USA.

Out of the few Vonnegut books I've read, this is the funniest, and probably the best. Basically, Kurt here dismisses the entire American nation as racist, materialist, and obsessed with sex, class, alcohol, conformity, and whatever else you could trot out. It would be considered a pessimistic, nihilistic viewpoint if it wasn't a sadly accurate look at the way America worked, and still works today. And for a little note to those who think the book is racist, keep in mind that the black characters are actually portrayed as being, in a way, a lot more intelligent and less misanthropic than the white ones. This isn't an easy book to describe. There's a plot, but Kurt veers away from it on several occasions, offering a wide variety of satiric tangents that make for some of the most hilarious parts of his writing. There are illustrations, crude, simple, and absolutely hilarious. Kurt even sticks himself in the book, makes himself a character, and has discussions with other characters. Choice segments include the scene at the Holiday Inn cocktail lounge, where Kurt has a discussion with himself; every discussion of Kilgore Trout's misadventures with getting his books published by his sleazy publishing house; the uproarious prologue; every illustration; every tangent; and... well, pretty much everything. It's not a book for everyone, but if you're looking for a whole ton of laughs in one place, and some of the best satire known to mankind... whoa. This is it. Oh yeah, the book's about what happens when car dealer Wayne Hoover decides everyone on Earth but him is a robot.

And it works, it works wondefully and I can't wait to read more of his works. Breakfast of Champions is about two men (a car salesman and a pulp fiction writer) who eventually cross paths in a cocktail lounge. The side characters aren't trivial - they each contribute in some way to each other and to the main characters. Vonnugut illustrates the book with simple and comical drawings that he did himself. While at times I wondered where in the story I was and what he was telling me about at the moment might (or might not) lead to, I stuck with it simply to keep enjoying his style and writing. The book seemed to be laughing at the planet and the people on it, breaking humans down into robots who are programmed to do this and that. Humans, in this novel, did not seem to enjoy the life they were living or take much pride in the world they lived in. The narrator (Vonnegut himself) often compares his characters penis size or the women's body measurements - otherwise nothing personal or individualistic about them. I looked up reviews and notes of the book after I finished reading hoping that they might offer something that I missed or a subplot that I didn't pick up on.

But on the other hand, this book really make you think - about the world, about our civilization and where it is heading, about the people and their strange ways, about America. When I first read the book I was still in communistic Poland, so I saw some of the problems the author was talking about as a part of the western civilization. Now after I read it again, I see so much mild critique of excesses of America's life. I live in America ~ 10 years so it is normal that for me America would be always something different than my home country or Europe. I am amazed that Vonnegut still can look at America from the position of the external observer, who still can see some absurdity in many aspects of life.

Not simply a satire of the \"Space Race,\" Vonnegut's first novel brings it all back home to earth all the vanity of vanities that spring from mankind in every civilization. The book focuses on the lives of two people:  Malachi Constant, a frivolous millionaire who puts much of his time and energy into space travel, and Winston Niles Rumfoord, an intellectual developer who entices Constant to go on a far-away journey at his own expense.  Rumfoord is the founder of a sect called The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent and the author of several staple near-future books, including 'The Pocket History of Mars'.  He is plotting a scheme to program all Martians (earthly human transplants) to make a futile attack on our home planet.  His intention is to make war so disastrous that man will abandon it on earth (not unlike Alfred Noble's inventing dynamite with the idea of making war so horrific, it would become obsolete).  Once Malachi is programmed as his alter ego, Unk, he awakens and tries to reunite his family and escape to earth... To go on with the development would be a spoiler, for the reader should curl up and read this piece of lit candy and revel in the story's unfolding.  The atmosphere is nearly perfect:  The novel is undoubtedly the most cartoonish of all of his books, yet the detailed development is realistic enough to transport us through space and time.  He makes the ridiculous plausible and the plausible ridiculous.  He has some of his most concise renderings of the folly of the human being and our history--as well as a good, solid-ground antidote to all of our foolishness.  Eventually, Malachi Constant does find out what's important in this life,...and, then, so do we.  How much is life determined by effort or by luck?  How much do God and man have a hand in human events?  Vonnegut may not give us all of the answers, but his observations are satisfying enough. (It's interesting to note, that having read 'Slaughterhouse Five,' arguably his best work, \"Trafalmadore,\" a distant planet in a distant galaxy is introduced here before his later classic.) (Reading Vonnegut brings to mind comparisons.  I think of Vonnegut as being influenced by the same pessimism as William Golding or Sartre.  Vonnegut seems as terse as Sartre, except fiercely funny.  Reading 'Sirens' also brings Ray Bradbury to mind.  Bradbury is grander, but Vonnegut makes tragedy into a farce.)

The second character is Vonnegut alter ego Kilgore Trout, the little-known sci-fi writer of interesting ideas and sloppy prose.  The last character is Vonnegut himself.  Vonnegut not only inserts his thoughts into the novel, but towards the end openly debates how to proceed with the story - providing a powerful end to the book.  Naturally, these pages also combine Vonnegut-style philosophy, thoughts about free will, and social critique of the USA circa 1973.

The characters are deep, thoughtful, emotional, almost too real in their complexity.  Each has his own hard set of problems or horrors to cope with.  There's a cop with a spousal relationship problem, an abused kid with a serious adjustment problem, an ex-mobster with some terrible secrets.  Their stories sometimes collide and sometimes run together, eventually converging into a deep and fascinating mystery.  The pace starts somewhat slowly, but the tension increases as the story unfolds, then refolds onto itself, then unfolds a little more.  I generally read more typical thrillers, so the slower pace of this book took a bit of adjustment.  But that pace enables Lehane to write with a degree of depth and detail that renders the tension greater, thicker and ultimately more troubling than the typical mystery.  Parts of this novel reminded me of the in-your-face, street-wise style of Chandler or Hammett; other parts evoked questions about morality and criminality more likely to arise in a college discussion of Dostoevsky.  Yet the story is seamless, fluid: like a polluted but powerful river that will run through your psyche well after you think you have finished this novel.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Wonderfully rich and rewarding story</td><td>5.0</td><td>I recently finished reading The Sirens of Titan, by Kurt Vonnegut.  What an amazing book!  It is definitely a unique and interesting read. The book is written as a science fiction story, but that hardly seems to matter.  As science fiction goes, it's a silly story.  Perhaps quaint or cute would best describe the science fiction.  But woven into this quirky little science fiction story is an endearing tale of one man's life as it is apparently determined completely out of his hands. As I read this easy little science fiction story, I was pleasantly surprised throughout the book, by moments of piercing satire or deep human emotion.  Like a glass of wine, the book has all these subtle flavors that sort of fade in and out through the story.  The writing is light and breezy, and the science fiction is quirky, but within that framework is an often dark and depressing tale, and a biting satire, and within that is an incredibly tender story, and all kinds of room to ponder the meaning of life.  It is a very satisfying read as all these things are mixed so well. On the copy I have the front cover has a quote from Esquire which states, \"He [Vonnegut] dares not only to ask the ultimate question about the meaning of life, but to answer it.\" Well, I don't know about that.  I certainly don't think Vonnegut gives the meaning of life in his book.  Like anyone else, he doesn't know, and I think he makes that pretty clear.  But he does provide a lot to reflect on, and I think what he does is give a bit of perspective to our lives.  For example, one of my favorite little gems for putting things into perspective was this conversation near the end of the book between Malachi Constant and Salo: \"You finally fell in love, I see,\" said Salo. \"Only an Earthling year ago,\" said Constant.  \"It took us that long to realize that a purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.\" Other questions regarding the existence of god or of man's control over his life could debated for hours without conclusion.  Vonnegut's book provides much food for thought in this, but no definite answers.  How could it be otherwise?  No matter what your own personal conclusions, the Sirens of Titan is sure to inspire additional insight.  The book is a delight to read, and will leave you pondering it long after you've finished reading it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of my Favorite SEP books</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is one of my favorite books written by Susan E.

I started the book a few days ago and I just couldn't put it down! I understand that Lehane is a crime/mystery novelist, but Mysitic River is much more than that. This is a mystery novel that has a soul. It has an emotional denisity that we rarely find in novels of this genre. It grabs you by the gut from the very first page and only lets go of you on the final page. In Mystic River, you have three childhood friends who are reunited by the gruesome murder of a young woman. Something horrible happened to one of them when they were younger, and the shadows of that event still haunt them. As the murder investigation, progresses, the three friends become entertwined, but not always in the ways you'd expect. One of them becomes the prime suspect, the other is the father of the deceased and the last is the cop who is doing the investigation. Rarely have I seen characters so fully fleshed out and realistic. It's like you've known these people all your life. They breathe, think and act like we would. Their dialogue is sharp and realistic and - and this is probably the book's best asset - simplistic. Rarely do I read a book where EVERY single character feels real and three-dimensional. This is one book you won't be able to put down. You'll want to read it from cover to cover in one sitting.

While MYSTIC RIVER remains noirish like his previous books, this stand-alone novel marks a gigantic leap forward for Lehane's writing career.  This book is the complex and densely-plotted story of three men who knew one another as boys. As a youth, Dave Boyle got into a car while his friends didn't.  Upon his return, he was different and that difference destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine and Jimmy Marcus.  As adults, Sean's a policeman, Jimmy's an ex-con, and Dave's struggling through life.  Their lives are disrupted by the murder of Jimmy's daughter.  Following the homicide, each man must confront a past he is not eager to face. Lehane works his story masterfully, showing once again why he is considered a true master of contemporary noir.  I recommend MYSTIC RIVER highly, and I hope readers keep comparing my work to Lehane's.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>awesome!!!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I had read two of SEP's books and I liked them because they weren't your \"run of the mill\" love story, but after reading this one, I was totally blown away!!! Colin Byrne is SUCH  a jerk at the beginning of the story yet even though his personality doesn't \"seem\" to change, you end up falling in love with him just the way he is. I couldn't believe how well he was able to \"control\" Sugar Beth with her caustic tongue and a mind of her own; a perfect match!!   As for Winnie, the ONLY time I liked her was towards the end when the Seawillows got back together and she sat and whined, feeling left out. I felt like she was just a whiner that needed to \"get over it already.\"   I loved the way SEP showed so many different levels of the main characters' personalities, I felt like I was right there with them......I bookmarked my favorite parts of the book and keep going back to read them....I ended up reading this book in 7 hours!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>First Dennis Lehane book read- very disappointing.</td><td>2.0</td><td>I have heard so much about Dennis Lehane that I felt obligated to read this new book. I'm kind of sorry that I did. Very convoluted, improbable plot; it tried the imagination. Perhaps the biggest fault of this book, however, lies in the main characters. Not one of them stood up as an admirable human being, and it was almost impossible for me (the reader) to develop any sort of rapport with any of them. For that matter, neither did the secondary cast of characters. They were all seriously flawed, and this set the tone for this novel. The reason that I gave this book two stars was because Lehane is obviously a very talented writer. From the way he handles words you can tell that given a different plot and a different cast of characters he could be one of the best.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Big surprise!</td><td>4.0</td><td>I wasn't going to read this book. I like SEP, but sometimes she gets a little too quirky for me, and I was sure that was going to be the case with Ain't She Sweet. I got it used for a couple of dollars and immediately groaned at the description of the hero. The initial description of Colin as a skinny schoolteacher with a huge nose and an affinity for poetry sounded totally opposite of what we've come to expect from our heroes. Still, the storyline drew me in immediately, and I was already laughing reading the first page. I actually ended up LOVING this story. I laughed so hard and even fell a little in love with Colin, even though he's English, which doesn't appeal to me. This one is definitely a keeper, just quirky enough to make you laugh, but heartbreakingly sweet at the same time. Give it a try.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The Trouble With Reading SEP Is...</td><td>5.0</td><td>....she spoils you for reading anything else for days after you've finished reading her book.  <sigh>  What's a bookworm to do?  Re-read all my other SEP keepers.  That's a plan. Seriously, I bought the paperback version the day it hit the shelves.  I don't buy hardbacks.  Can't afford them and they're not easy to read in bed.  Then, I let the book sit in my TBR box by the bed.  It sat and sat and sat.  I kept reading other stuff.  Was I trying to age it like fine wine? I think the plot synopsis put me off and I was afraid I wouldn't like the book.  Silly me!  I forgot into who's hands I was putting myself.  Once I got into the story, I couldn't put the darned book down.  I read till 4am to finish. Sugar Beth was certainly no misunderstood teen.  She hurt a lot of people before she left them all behind.  Forever, she thought. She put the capital SB in Spoiled Bitch. Colin was wonderful and I could certainly understand his lingering anger at Sugar Beth and his need for revenge.  Their battles were fantastic and I can't wait to read them again. The Sea Willows were a great bunch of women.  I'd like to have them as my friends.  I didn't blame them a bit for getting some of their own back when Sugar Beth was serving them at Colin's party.  They deserved the chance to \"git 'er\". The thing that raises this book above all others is the backbone of Sugar Beth and her willingness to take her punishement fairly gracefully.  And the sex is hot, hot, hot. As you can tell, I loved this book after all.  Now it has been moved from the TBR pile to the Keeper shelf.  Deservedly so.  I love SEP's women.  And the men are equally strong.  They have to be to deal with those Amazons.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>To be less than subtle: it's bad.</td><td>1.0</td><td>Poorly written, poorly edited (too many typos!!), and full of modern-day phrasing.

Boy was I wrong! After reading the book in 1 night, I now have a new SEP favorite! While some parts are funny, Ain't She Sweet is unbelievably emotional and heart-wrenching. It's a testament to SEP's writing talent because many less accomplished writers would have made me hate Sugar Beth for the mean things that she did in high school. Instead, I was cheering her from the beginning, hoping that everything would work out for her. The other characters in the story are just as strong and delightful. This book is definitely a keeper. Read it when you feel like immersing yourself in a good book that will overcome you with its emotional depths.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of the best crime novels ever written</td><td>5.0</td><td>Dennis Lehane wisely elected to take a break from his Kenzie-Gennaro mystery series, and gambled on a new and different venture, a more broadly drawn novel of crime, consequence, and human frailty and folly.  The results are staggeringly successful, as *Mystic River* is nothing short of a masterpiece within the crime novel genre. In terms of the mystery story line, I suppose some readers can rightfully find fault with the book, including its ending.  It is neither the most intricate nor the most surprise-filled tale of its type.  What's amazing about *Mystic River*, however, is that in some ways the \"mystery story\" actually is less riveting and significant than is the overall collage of characters, times, and places.  This is not just a \"mystery novel\" but a \"novel,\" period, one that engages the reader from page one and never lets go until the last line on page four hundred. Lehane has a knack for capturing in a few well-chosen words and phrases what people are feeling and thinking, what makes them tick, what drives them for good or (in his stories, mostly) for evil.  The man can flat-out write, and with each new novel his skills move to yet another level. The one \"yeah, but\" that emerged for me as I read *Mystic River* was of the political/philosophical type.  Clearly, the world as portrayed by Dennis Lehane is a twisted, dark, and unhappy place.  With the exception of his troubled-but-doing-the-right-thing protagonists, the characters that animate his vision of human existence tend toward the haunted and desperate, and the overall mood and message of *noir* sticks with you long after you've finished his books.  Are people really as tragically scarred and warped as Lehane tells us?  Are we to take this dark vision of human life to heart and allow it to shape (and limit) our philosophies, actions, and notions of what is possible for our lives and the lives of those around us?  I like to think that this cynical world-view is *meant* to be partial, that it leads us into a dark and frightening but unabashedly *fictional* world that is not intended to be a literal mirror of the real world--in other words, it's art, but it's also show biz, and we as readers should not mistake its message, however spellbinding, for any overly serious declaration about the totality of the \"human condition.\"  When we enter Lehane's universe, we are invited, even forced to suspend to some degree our critical everyday notions about human nature, social progress, and the human capacity for noble as well as terrible deeds.  It's like looking at the world as the distorted reflection of a carnival side-show mirror--what we see is indeed a reflection of things that are real, but the image is hardly meant to be accurate and photographic. On the other hand, however, once a reader has considered human existence as it is portrayed by a wordmaster like Lehane, it's hard not to allow his insights and visions to affect daily thoughts about \"life\" and \"people.\"  His writing is immensely powerful, and it stays with you long after you've moved on to other authors, books, and literary genres.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Who reads this drivel?</td><td>1.0</td><td>I am absolutely mystified as to how something as poorly written and researched as this could ever be considered by an agent and/or publisher. I borrowed the book and, as another reviewer mentioned, could not finish it, although I skimmed the last chapters. My motivation was more curiosity than actual interest. First, the language is absurd, both in regards to dialogue and narrative. The modern idioms are jarring, and the obscenties are both inappropriate to the character, and anachronistic. At times Anne Boleyn is shrewish and flat, at others, maudlin and melodramatic. The \"f-word\" was definitely in use by Anglo-Saxon times, but simply meant sowing fields with seed; the notion of Anne Boleyn dropping the modern idiom \"f-bomb\" is simply absurd. I suspect her often employed insults were edgy, even brutal, but not cellar rat obscene. To reduce her wit to something akin to the scatological rumblings of a teenage boy is the mark of a hack writer. As a historian specializing in this period (medieval and early Renaissance England), I have never encountered a good piece of fiction concerning this tragic and complex queen. None have captured a period feel (in language, setting, attitudes or thought processes), nor been historically accurate. I simply do not understand why facts must be distorted,  embellished, ignored, or created, as Anne Boleyn lived an extraordinary life in an extraordinary time. This is just another tedious exercise in distorted reality, similar to that execrable \"The Other Boleyn Girl\".</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Once won't be enough!</td><td>5.0</td><td>You'll be longing to read this book more than once because you'll be reluctant to give the characters up.

After three serious attempts to read this book I GIVE UP.  Tedious and trite, this is just not a good book.  Like other successful series authors, I think that Lehane has gotten a little tired of his literary offspring and wanted to try something else.  In my opinion, what he has produced here simply wasn't worth his effort or worthy of his considerable talent.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Ain't She Sweet?</td><td>4.0</td><td>This is the first book by SEP, as she is called by her many long time fans, that I have had the pleasure of reading.  \"AIN'T SHE SWEET\" is an interesting tale about what happens when a small southern towns bad girl returns home. Sugar Beth Carey was the most hated girl in Parish, Mississippi. She was beautiful, rich and came from one of the town's most prominent families and now 15 years later she is forced to return home to Parish after a string of bad luck.  But don't think that this is the story of a woman who has been humbled by the hardships befallen her and has returned home to make amends.  Sugar Beth has lost none of her edge and is simply in need of some fast cash so she can hightail it right back out of her small Mississippi town.  Unfortunately this is not as easy as she may have hope and she is force to come face to face with old enemies who still hold old grudges. \"AIN'T SHE SWEET\" is not the funny romp that I expected when I purchased it, it does have it's more serious moments.

Contrary to popular belief, those with a Southern accent should not have 100 IQ points automatically deducted.  Southern women survived the most horrific time of US History and I am proud to say that Southern Women are truly Steel Magnolias. So if you believe Southern Women truly arrest at 15...then I suppose the rest of us should believe New Jersey women appear and talk like those in 'Working Girl' and y'all are really married to the Mob.

I wasn't quite sure at first if this series would be one after reading the inaugural entry by Dennis Lehane.  But ultimately the pros outweighed the cons.  Lehane gave a great sense of the neighborhoods and streets that I've spent my entire life in and on.  Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, the two protagonists, are flawed, human characters with enough real life foibles to provide enough conflict to propell the series forward.  And in their psycho friend, Bubba, Lehane provides the killing machine that every successful detective series requires.  (You know; Hawk, Joe Pike, Easy Rawlins cousin, Mouse, etc.) My main exception to the story was the depiction of gang war in Boston that made the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan' look tame.  I thought that Lehane went way overboard with the body count.  It just didn't seem realistic.  But, as you can see by my heading, I felt that there was enough here to make me look forward to the subsequent sequels.  I think that the quality of the plots took a leap in subsequent installments and the overall series is terrific.  I highly recommend the entire series.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Man, Oh Man, I loved this!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Based upon customer reviews of Dennis LeHane's series of novels featuring detectives Kenzie and Gennaro, I bought all of them at one time and have just finished this series debut. I had not quite finished it last night  when I went to bed. After about 30 minutes of wondering what was going to  happen, I got up and finished the book in the middle of the night. That's  gotta tell you something! I am mesmerized by the characters: the detectives  are sharp, quirky, risk-taking folks most of the time; and they surround  themselves with a wonderful assortment of cohorts from Bubba the bodyguard  to Devin and Oscar the cops. Throw in a sympathetic priest and you have an  excellent mix of lovable, if not quite understandable, characters. The  story was gripping, terrifying and believable. I couldn't wait to start  \"Darkness, Take my Hand, \" the second in the series, but I did  wait until the coffee perked this a.m. A must read, but read the series in  order so you don't miss the personal and touching references to the  childhoods and personal lives of the heroes!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Lehane, please join us in the 21st century.</td><td>1.0</td><td>I love to read and I am always looking for good mysteries and science fiction.  Amazon.com and Waldenbooks both listed Dennis Lehane on my account under recommendations.  I read the first few pages of three of his books and bought them, now I wish I had read a little further.  Lehane gets  rave reviews from quite a few sources and nowhere in those reviews have I  seen one word about Lehane being ignorant, disrespectful and downright  prejudiced, which he is.  You see Lehane refers to black people with that  old ugly word, yes the 'n' word.  He is consistent and most of the  characters in this book use that ugly archaic term.  It must make things  easier for Lehane in terms of characther development, look at all the time  he saves in fleshing out a character by simply describing them as a nigger.  Well Lehane, I am Black and definitely not a nigger.  I am a consumer, a  consumer who loves to spend money on books and one who will never again  enrich you coffers with even ten cents of my money.  If anyone is looking  for a detective to love try teaming up with Elvis Cole, a series of books  by  Robert Crais.  If you see people as people, good and bad, don't buy  books from this author who sees people in terms of color and if the color  isn't white then the person couldn't possibly be a good worthwhile human  being.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A tremendous first novel!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Dennis Lehane has given the PI genre a much needed shot in the arm with A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR, the first book of the Kenzie/Gennaro series.

For instance, the opportunity cost of travelling to work, searching for work and bringing work home- all adds up to performing substantial tasks free of charge. The author inspires us to measure and quantify our greatest achievements and to do what we do best. There are chapters on how to compare job offers for those who work and how to get an exceptional raise. Essentially, the author's strategies require that we track very carefully all of our efforts so that the substantiation is present when we ask for a raise. The Pollan book will be helpful in focusing your career planning and on contemplating whether or not you should work for yourself or work for others.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of Vonnegut's better books</td><td>4.0</td><td>Breakfast of Champions is one of Vonnegut's more light-hearted pieces.  However, the book does have serious comments on society, life, and the interaction of people.  The story follows two characters:  Mr. Trout, a science fiction writer; and a car salesman by the name of Mr. Hoover. Kilgore Trout has been summoned by Elliot Rosewater (who is also the main character in Kurt Vonnegut's \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\") to be the guest of honor at an arts festival.  Quite suprised that anyone even knows he exists, Mr. trout sets off across the country to attend the event.  Along the way, Vonnegut treats the reader to a variety of Trout's short story ideas (most of which sound like either bad, or really obscure science fiction).  At the same time, the story follows Wayne Hoover's dysfunctional sturggle to make it through life as an automobile salesman.  The story focuses both men as they progress towards, and eventually converge on the arts festival.  Many characters that appear in this novel also appear in other Vonnegut novels, making it an excellent introduction to Kurt Vonnegut's work.   Among the many minor (or mini) themes that Vonnegut offers the reader throughout the book, a major one emerges.  He seems to say that people should be careful of what they say, or write, because we effect other is ways that we can't even imagine (both negativelly and possitivelly).  Often times we are, and remain, unaware of the consequences of our actions.   There is also another aspect of the novel that is noteworthy:  The illustrations.  Mr. Vonnegut weaves rather simple drawing into the actual text of the story (often for a humorous effect).  These illustrations often take the place of verbal descriptions.  For the first hundred pages, or so, this style is interesting.  However, after that it grows old, and begins to seem like an easy way to avoid describing objects.  This, however, is my only complaint concerning the book.  I would recomend the novel to any Kurt Vonnegut fan.  I would also recomend this as an introduction to Mr. Vonnegut's work, or to a person who loves humorous stories.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Definitely worth the time</td><td>5.0</td><td>After being in the workforce for 15 years I thought I was an expert, but there are a lot of gems in this book.

It's about taking proactive steps to avoid being in a one-down position. You'll like Fire Your Boss if you buy into the authors' value system  Pollan and Levine don't mince words.  Work, they say, is about money. Given a choice of two job offers, choose whichever gives you the most money, time or both. Don't expect satisfaction and fulfillment from work. For many people, this advice will make sense. However, some people work in truly toxic environments and they'll become ill -- mentally and/or physically -- if they stay. Some companies (such as SAS in North Carolina) offer quality of life that makes sense for many employees. And some people manage to have truly wonderful jobs. Once on the job, say the authors, success comes from pleasing your boss. Never mind the company: it's all about keeping your boss on your side because she's the only person who can help you.  In general, this advice is excellent; however, company culture can influence your boss's power, your ability to transfer within the firm and/or your ability to avoid being fired. I stay away from absolutes -- so \"Nobody hires a stranger\" should be translated, \"People like to hire their friends.\" The best section of the book covers networking: these days, you make friends, not contacts. So your long-term strategy will involve joining groups and socializing with people who can help you. And, as with all career books, you have to do some reality checks. When you get a competing offer from an outside firm, say the authors, pay attention to a counter-offer from your own firm.  However, some experts say that sixty to eighty percent of employees who accept those counteroffers are gone in six months. If you do accept a counteroffer, get a contract or the type of termination agreement these authors recommend. The very best advice from these authors: Always keep \"fishing,\" as they say. Never stop watching the job market. Prepare to move for the right conditions. I don't agree with their checklists of \"factors\" -- I've developed my own decision processes -- and I think you have to be careful before jumping ship too fast. Some people are hired to be scapegoats, some bosses have hidden agendas, and some employees do get stranded in tiny towns in the middle of nowhere. I suspect the authors fill in the blanks when they're coaching one-to-one and/or they choose their clients very, very carefully.  And I definitely recommend this book as a perspective that, while incomplete, offers a helpful corrective to the airy promises of \"Dream and do it.\" For career change, I'd supplement with Herminia Ibarra's Working Identity and Martha Beck's Finding Your Own North Star.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Highly Entertaining</td><td>5.0</td><td>Breakfast of Champions has to be one of the wittiest and cleverest books I've ever read. Witty for the irrevent, and quite hilarous, first few chapters; clever for the way that the seemingly random plot elements fall together, and the ingenious way in which Vonnegut inserts himself into his own novel. (What would you do if you met your Creater? Ha!) This book doesn't have very much in the way of plot, but then, this is Vonnegut we're talking about here. The story here is really secondary to the social criticism that Vonnegut doles out. Here we get his views on many things (America, slavery, racism, pollution, sex, God) all woven into the story in a clever and entertaining way. Vonnegut has an odd way of keeping you reading, he's not a master of suspense per se, but his books are always hard to put down. For one thing, his prose is always clear and lucid, and the writing is extremely fast-paced, also he drops here and there hints of what is to come in the novel without actually spelling out the details. One would think this would make it pointless and useless to finish the book, but it has, in fact, the opposite effect. I highly reccommend Breakfast of Champions to anyone looking for a good, fast, and funny read, or to those who can appreciate something truly off-kilter.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>momentous</td><td>5.0</td><td>I love this book for so many reasons it's hard to sum up in a small review.... one thing I do enjoy throughout most of Vonneguts novels is it's mixture of complexity and simplicity.  By complexity I mean his overall vision and view of life.  In this book I disagree with one of the comments on the back cover that refers to Vonnegut answering the meaning of life.  One of the things that most interest me about his novels is not the answer he gives; yet the questions he dares his readers to ask themselves.  And there in lies the meaning of life.  This is where his simplicity takes over.  His style of writing is as if he's shining a flashlight to lead you through a dark room.  This book is a must read for all Vonnegut fanes.  It's still a toss up to which is the better novel this or Slaughterhouse.  I think anyone would enjoy either.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Not for everyone.</td><td>4.0</td><td>Dig it.  I do anyways.  Maybe you won't.  It's entirely up to taste and whatnot.  Vonnegut's story is lovely, and so is Vonnegut's storytelling.  Vonnegut tells his tale in a condescending manner.  He talks to the world  as if we're all a bunch of kids, having to show us little pictures of  everything.  This storytelling is often hilarious, though it can get  annoying to some people.  The book is about our rotten, lowly existence.  Vonnegut condescends because people are (apparently in Vonnegut's eyes)  generally idiots, and Vonnegut is god of this story.  He even steps into  the story (love it of hate it) and chills out in his own creation.  All  powerful and completely omniscient, he tells you about everyone and  everything in the city.  Making for wonderful characterization.  By the  end, Midway City seems to breathe.  Some will love this.  Others will be  completely annoyed by Vonnegut laughing in their face and his madcap style.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Underrated is an understatement for Sirens...</td><td>5.0</td><td>When people hear the name Kurt Vonnegut, they think of Slaughterhouse 5, or Cat's Cradle, or perhaps even that his books are often burned in high schools around the country for their dim look at human existence.  Not to,  in any way, down play the importance or greatness of his more famous works,  as I love them all, but I must say that Sirens of Titan is superior to his  other works.  For some reason, perhaps the science fiction aspects of the  novel, this book has not received its deserved recognition.  I read  approximately the first fifty pages thinking that this book would be about  the same as his other novels.  I almost put it away to start a different  one.  Thankfully, I pressed on.  Literally, a few pages later, I was  entranced by the language, the structure, the revealed surprises, and the  humanity of The Sirens of Titan.

MASQUERADING THE MARQUESS is no exception.  It seeks to be amusing and pleasant. However, too many characters and too much scrambled detail fill this storyline! Calliope Minton is a motivated Regency caricature artist - incognito of course!  Her target is England's upper class and culture. She loves to trouble and demean the rich and highborn.  Her number one victim is James Trenton, the Marquess of Angelford.  Why is Calliope so ruthless?  Because she and her mother were once victims of a scheming rogue -- or so Calliope remembers! Angelford may be a marquess, but he is also a member of an elite society.  Men who serve England's foreign office; men who protect the British Empire from distress . . . For Calliope and James, their attraction radiates and heated sparks fly.  Everyone, IN the story, can feel the pull - everyone except James and Calliope.  Antagonistically, the two are forced to work together to solve the disappearance of a mutual friend which only leads further into the depths of a dark mystery. Disappointingly, a contemporary weight is felt throughout the story.  And although Anne Mallory tries to convey a heated attraction between the main characters, the warmth is just not felt!

As anyone schooled in Astrology knows, the Rising Sign is very significant, as well as the Moon Sign, in shaping our personalities and relationships with others. I do not recommend this book at all because it takes itself too seriously--by creating such overly specific traits per sign (e.g. Aquarian men often talk fervently and look to their side like they're on camera and addressing it...) GIVE ME A BREAK! That is WAY too... specific, which is essentially too far-fetched to assume the majority of people born under this sign would fit that trait. The book is also just full of biased, even prejudice assumptions: All Cancer gay men are essentially WOMEN, who cannot be anything but the feminine partner, in a gay union? Aquarian women are essentially giant nerds with no personality or backbone, apparently, even though Aquarius is the sign of Feminism and Revolutionaries... did the author not get the memo?

To change his image, he decides to hire a wife for six months, to give the illusion of stability and hopefull get the business loan.  He hires Maggie Toone in New Jersey and brings her to his farm.  She's eager to escape her small town life and job as a teacher, and relishes the chance to fulfill her dream of writing a book based upon her aunt's diaries.  One small problem - her aunt was the local madam. This is a very funny and witty book.  Hank and Maggie's relationship is romantic and sexy.  The dialogue is classic Evanovich - she easily writes in the rhythm of natural speech so the reader feels as though he/she could step right into the conversation.  Hank falls in love with Maggie right off the bat and plots to make their marriage a real one; she is not so sure that she wants to be stuck in another small town.  Elsie Hawkins, a reoccuring character in Ms. Evanovich's romances, is present here as a temporary housekeeper.  She is the prototype of the Grandma Mazur character of the Stephanie Plum series - a feisty, blunt-speaking senior who drives a '57 Cadillac, packs a gun, and is in serious pursuit of the male species (in her age group, they tend to drop dead unexpectedly so she tries to act quickly).

Far from fun, much of what I saw in the book is biased and negative; sign studies felt heavily male and gay oriented, downplaying and shunting women into the background a bit. An added warning: it's also written in what appears to be UK English, dappled in pretentious obscure literati turns of phrase (including haughty doses of unnecessary French terminology that evade US English Kindle dictionary look-ups altogether) which makes it an uncomfortable read for most Americans.

It is amazing how they delivered with precision the details of each sign. I have read and studied astrology for many years and never found another book as informative and accurate as this one. The signs in the book address the positives and negatives and what was truly amazing was the information on the complexity of the earth signs [Taurus, Virgo and Capricorns] and Pisces. These signs are the most confounding and confusing of the zodiac, however upon reading their descriptive explanations as to why these signs are designed as they are, revelations of information flood you with knowledge about how to cope with them and understand how to push their on and off buttons and how to avoid conflicts. Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Aquarious and Sagittarius are amazing reads and their personalities are quite different, unique and easily understandable. Cancer and Scorpio are without much fanfare and deeply dedicated to family. If you want to learn about the intricate details and workings of each sign as well as the parental connections each likely had and how family relates together, this is the book to read.

Occasionally, I just don't feel like investing the energy in a novel. No, I'd rather dally. A short story collection is the perfect solution at these times, much like sampling dim sum rather than sitting down to a seven-course feast. I've been on a short story binge lately, and it's been so delicious that my love affair with short fiction has been rekindled.  A MOMENT ON THE EDGE is a massive (over 500 pages) compilation of luscious tidbits. The editor, much-loved mystery novelist Elizabeth George, starts us out with a fascinating introduction discussing our simultaneous fascination with crime stories and the low value many people place on it. She briefly sums up the history of female mystery writers. About the authors of this anthology, George says: \"All of them share in common a desire to explore mankind in a moment on the edge. The edge equates to the crime committed. How the characters deal with the edge is the story.\"  The collection begins with \"A Jury of Her Peers\" by Susan Glaspell (1917) and ends with \"English Autumn--American Fall\" by Minette Walters (2001). The variety of crime stories is immense, including cozies, murder mysteries, suspense tales, horror stories, psychological studies, and more. Reading the older tales and then moving on to the more modern works is a subtle education in how crime stories have changed over the years.  Some of the authors' contributions are completely unlike their novels (for example, Nancy Pickard's dark \"Afraid All the Time.\") In other cases, characters from an author's novels appear in her short story (such as Sara Paretsky's \"The Case of the Pietro Andromache.\") I joyfully became reacquainted with authors I've loved (and nearly forgotten) for years, such as Charlotte Armstrong and Shirley Jackson. I also discovered many writers whose novels I will now find and devour, having sampled their wares.  I must admit to sometimes skimming and/or skipping stories in an anthology if they don't catch my interest. However, I was never tempted to skim or skip a word in this fine collection. In such a group of stellar tales, I discovered a few personal standouts:   A ghost appears in Agnes and Oscar's RV as they winter in Arizona (\"Death of a Snowbird\" by J. A. Jance), setting the plot spinning and giving me goose bumps.   A picnicking couple discusses their relationship in \"The River Mouth\" by Lia Matera. They're approached by someone who puts the STRANGE in the word \"stranger\" --- and completely creeped me out.   Joyce Carol Oates's \"Murder-Two\" is gut-churningly disturbing. My first inclination is to say I hated this piece about a murdered mother, yet I'll never forget the plot or my strong reaction to it.   \"Afraid All the Time\" by Nancy Pickard, in which a woman's move to the plains sends her over the edge into depression and fear, impressed me with its darkness and unpredictable twists.   One man suggests to another that he has the means to murder anyone in Dorothy Sayers's \"The Man Who Knew How,\" a fine exercise in obsession, psychological suspense and blackest irony  .  A dirt-poor woman discovers how to step up to finer living in \"A Nice Place to Stay\" by Nedra Tyre, a story with sociological implications that ring true today.  A MOMENT ON THE EDGE is an absolute delight. Don't wait for commitment phobia to strike before treating yourself to this excellent collection.  --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Excellent book</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is worth a read even if you don't believe in astrology.

I've read all except for the middle three in the series. This book while it left some unanswered questions, and brought up others also left me with the feeling that I want another story from Peters. The author does a great job with character developement and though I felt that Nefret and Ramses where a little on the whinning side of things where still interesting to read. I would have like more of a romance thing with Amelia and Emerson- after all really she is the main or should be the main character in these books. That seems to be the only thing I would like to see more off in this book and the series in general is more Amelia and less of Nefret and Ramses - give them there own series if you must but please leave Amelia. I did like this book because it seemed to visualize more of the Egypt that I like - mysterious and interesting. But this book had passages and places that I wonder if I would have found more interesting if I had read the one where they got Nefret (that is one of the three I've yet to read). Anyway- if you like Peters works then you should enjoy this book, but don't be to critical on certain things as the author did leave a lot of holes and questions. Just sit back and enjoy the read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of the best...</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is only my second book by the author and she's becoming a fast favorite.

That's quite an unusual way for a romance novel! Usually it is always the heroine who is forced to marry, so it was interesting to see that Karen Hawkins took an unique spin on this storyline and I was intrigued to see how she would pull it off. But what a disappointment this book was! It wasn't funny nor cute (which the very nice cover and the jacket blurb led me believe it would be), the story was shallow and Karen Hawkins didn't make any effort to make her characters 3D and interesting, she kept them one dimensional and simple, the \"twists and turns\" in the storyline were forced and not even surprising, I seriously regret spending those few hours I spent reading this. I tried to warm to the heroes and though there were a few characteristics that made me like them and root for them, I think it's the author's fault that she didn't give us enough to fall in love with them. The romance part was kept basic and simple too: one moment the hero and the heroine realise they are in love with each other, but you can't see what or how they came to love each other. There is no character transformation, yes it is stated that just with a snap of fingers Jack the gambling and unfaithful playboy wants to forsake London and his previous lifestyle and \"bury himself\" in the Scottish countryside and become an exemplary husband and family man. Which wouldn't be so unbelievable, I have seen such transformation completely credible in other stories, but here the author just states he was a new man, but doesn't show how and why he came to be so different. This book lacks humour, wit, romance, character and storyline depth, so everything that makes a story a good one. If you'd like to read a good, funny and cute Scottish romance I'd rather suggest you read some Julie Garwood (The Secret, The Wedding..) than waste your time and money with this.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Great Start To New Series!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would. I usually do not like elements in romance novels such as Fiona being able to alter the weather based on her moods, but that aspect of the book did not take away from my enjoyment of Fiona and Jack's story. I understand the complaint others have of Fiona being too judgmental of Jack considering she forced him into the marraige. I was able to tolerate this aspect of Fiona's character because she wanted him to take their marriage seriously because she loved him. Once I learned of the \"powers\" Fiona and her brothers had concerning the weather, I immediately dismissed the future books in this series. However, by the end of this book, I wanted to know more about her brothers and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.

This is, of course, the love interest - widowed Patience Thistlethwaite. All is set for Patience and Reeves to push, pull and drag Tristan into the shape of an Earl. This sounds interesting in the usual way, but it's not. The whole premise of the English laws of inheritance is manipulated into oblivion. Alas, I could not help but compare this to a far finer book using the same idea of a father trying to redress the law of primogeniture to his preference - \"Mr Scarbourough's Family\" by Anthony Trollope. Possibly not a fair comparison, but the plot immediately called it to mind. It's not a bad book, just not terribly good. The characters go through the motions.

I find myself re-reading and re-re-reading each novel and noticing little details that escaped me before.  The exploits of the Emerson clan are fascinating and history buffs will also like the skillful way in which Peters weaves real history and historical figures into their story. Every character is compelling and vividly drawn, even the villains! And, speaking of villains, the Master Criminal returns in this one, I believe! For those who are just discovering  the series, I recommend starting at the beginning-- it's worth the time and will help with some details and references in the later books, since the characters sometimes refer to earlier adventures and old friends  tend to reappear.

As always from the begin you get to certain people that don't seem right and they become number one on the list of people that have some thing to do with what ever the crime is it always fun to take some one off the list that could not have done the crime.  The one character that I have a problem trusting is Sethos I know that he may have be refromed be Amelia but I really don't trust him and I really don't think that Emerson or Ramses trust him very much.

It's about a fan letter from the great French Renaissance art historian, B. Berenson, and his novel FAHRENHEIT 451, which connected them fifty years ago into a remarkable friendship. He wrote THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES in 1944 as a collection of stories.  He became intersted in the Red Planet as a ten-year-old in Waukegan, Illinois, out looking at the night stars and the \"special red fire burning in the dark\" sky.  He collected Buck Rogers comics, and his favorite was \"Buck & Wilma on the Red Planet.\"  He read Edgar Rice Burrough's THE GODS OF MARS.  Then, after finishing school, he got a job working on an astronomical program for the Smithsonian Planetarium.  He studied some photos of the mysterious universe taken by Lowell Observatory.  The started pondering on the Big Bang Theory and the impossibility of so simple (and complex) a creation for our world. In 2000, at the age of eighty, he remembers how all this early sky watching adn deep thinking had evolved into his science fiction writing.  When he was twelve, he became fascinated with the pterodactyl and Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur ride at the Chicago Century of Progress Fair.  The 'Sinclair Oil's frozen-in-place paper-mache prehistoric monsters were on the world's first animatronic display.  The moving platform provided a four-minute jaunt back to the Past. First, he's soared into the future in his imagination toward the cosmos.  Using the Grand Canyon as foundation for Space Station #1: Earth, his 'Chronicles' took him first to Space Station #1: the Moon.  On to #3, Mars; then take off for the whole Universe.  Our Space program since the 1960s has taken us there and back, now we're on a mission to Pluto, the last unexplored planet in the solar system. When he fell \"backward to the future,\" the dinosaurs \"delivered me to tomorrow in ways I could not imagine.\"  The memory of walking backward through Chicago's multimillion-year remembrance enabled him to write the screenplay for 'Moby Dick.\"  From there, he was commissioned to develop a building at the New York World's Fair in 1964, with a ride through America's history.  He was asked, \"Can you create a four-hundred-year history of America in seventeen minutes flat, with a full symphony orchestra?\"  He was delivered \"to the topmost interior of the United States Pavilion, where, gliding on a circular track as big as a football field, he wept in disbelief that by long ago stepping in reverse, he had fallen into Now.\" That led into the grand Disney offer to develop the Epcot Center.  Walt's Imagineers had a 50 million-dollar building to transform into the world of tomorrow.  \"Can you write a two-thousand-year communication history in twelve minutes flat with a full symphony orchestra?\"  He'd made a journey from cave to Ben Franklin's lightning shocks, to Apollo's Moon and beyond.  He dedicates this volume \"with love to my friends, Loren Eiseley and Aldous Huxley, whose essays showed me the way.\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Never Quite \"Gelled\" Into The Book It Could Have Been</td><td>3.0</td><td>Bradbury Speaks isn't bad...but it's also not that good. Ray Bradbury HAS lived one heck of a life, and in this life, Bradbury has moved through the ages among some of the most interesting and famous people of our time. All the while, he has remained a forward-thinking optimist and a lover of both middle America and the one-time dream city of the 20th century, Los Angeles, where he's lived sans a car for some fifty years. The Bradbury his three-dozen essays introduce is variously Ray Bradbury the cantankerous old coot, Bradbury the surprisingly lusty young buck, Bradbury the opinionated idealist and Bradbury the name-dropper. What was missing from this collection was Bradbury, master of the written word. There just wasn't much to pin down my attention here. I wanted him to talk more about his books and I wanted him to share what made him tick. In short, I wanted to get to know Ray Bradbury better.  I thought I'd enjoy this trail back through Bradbury's nine decades, but in his true tales he failed to reach out with the kind of offerings that have made his fiction the stuff of modern legend. Here we can learn about certain events that inspired a few of his books, and we can be a party to his state of mind at various times. We can find out that Bradbury admires Walt Disney's appreciation of joy, and that Bradbury regards Disneyland as the epitome of that lovely inner-happiness expressed before all the world, but for every truly worthy anecdote, we must read thru half a dozen other lesser drags on the reader's time. This book doesn't take anything away from Bradbury's career achievements but it doesn't do a lot toward adding to them, either.

After graduating from Stanford, marrying, and living in Germany with her husband while he competed his military assignment, Sandra Day O'Connor eventually settled in Phoenix.  Failing to find employmente commensurate with her education, she started a law firm with another attorney, had three sons (took off five years to raise them), joined many community boards, helped/led several major Republican political campaings, became an assistant State's Attorney General, was appointed to a legislative vacancy (and subsequently elected in her own right), and became President of the State Senate. Upon William Rehnquist's nomination to the Supreme Court, Sandra O'Connor undertook considerable effort to support him, including contacting fellow Stanford classmates, U.S. Senators, and newspaper editors, as well as making supporting speeches.  Afterwards she left the State Senate to run for a vacant county judge position (won). Several years later O'Connor was appointed by Governor Babbitt (Dem) to the state Appeals Court, and then had the opportunity to spend some time vacationing with Chief Justice Burger. O'Connor's having grown up on a Western ranch seemed to make her more attractive to President Reagan, who had made a campaign promise to appoint a woman to the Court.  Her prior abortion stance (voted to end an Arizona law prohibiting it) threatened to torpedo her nomination, but supporters (including Senator Goldwater) managed to quickly move the process forward and overcome opposition. The remainder of the book details O'Connor's actions in a number of Court cases.  (It was somewhat comforting to read of how sharply she honed in on issues while on the Court - I had a brief experience before her in her County Court, and was amazed and even intimidated by her sharp questioning even then.) Finally, while I have the highest regard for Justice O'Connor, it was disappointing to read of the large role played by politics - even in our judicial system, and especially the centrality of the abortion issue.  I was also unhappy to read about O'Connor's political comments (wanting to retire while a Republican was President), her dancing around the abortion issue, and key role in the 2000 election.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Best single volume of the short fiction</td><td>5.0</td><td>I prefer the Everyman's volumes because the typesetting is so much nicer.

I mean he's a professional writer and he spent a lot of time on Wall Street before and during the bubble years, up close and personal.  And he wasn't a stock broker and he wasn't a trader.  He was an analyst in technology stocks during a time when technology stocks mushroomed up like tulips under the windmills.  A stock analyst studies the industry and the individual companies.  He knows revenues and profits and cash flow and debts and bottom lines.  He's a fundamentalist.  He makes recommendations.  Buy, hold, sell--well, they never actually recommended \"sell\" in those days.  Presumably he knows when the price of a stock is out of step with what it's worth. But the bubble years were tough times for fundamentalists since the ducks were quacking and when the ducks quack they say, \"We don't need no stinkin' fundamentals.  We just buy the dips.\" At some point Kessler discovered that there's something wrong with this picture.  If a stock analyst knows so much why is he working for Goldman Sacks or Morgan Stanley?  If he knows which stocks are going to go up and which are going to go down, why hasn't he mortgaged the ranch and milked all his relatives for funds and invested in the stocks himself? Here's the answer.  Hold on to your sweet petunias.  As Kessler notes in the very first chapter he's only supposed to get it right 51% of the time, and with a little hedging and ex-post facto double-talk, he can fudge that.  In other words, it's crystal ball time, and rational people don't raid the cookie jar to bet on flips of the coin. Let me tell you what an \"analyst\" is called  in Las Vegas.  An analyst is a \"tout.\"  That's a \"Gold Sheet\" or a \"Green Sheet\" sold in liquor stores and bars with a phone number and some stars and exclamation points advertising their monster \"**Superlock of the Week!!!**\"  That is, you pay them some money and they tell you which sports team to bet on.  Needless to say, if they really knew who was going to cover the spread that week, they would mortgage the ranch...etc. By the way, one of the problems with Andy's strict fundamentalist approach is that the markets are not entirely rational, which is why there is such a thing as technical analysis, which basically says the trend is your friend, or forget the fundamentals, buy the chart--or more deeply understood, buy the irrational exuberance of the public, which is what most of the people who made money in the go-go nineties did.  A nice little book that explains some of this is Joel Kurtzman's How the Markets Really Work (2002) where he gives his conviction that, \"Markets may move to the beat of their dumbest members,\" adding, \"In my view...markets are not rational.\" Anyway, at some point (it is clear to me) Andy Kessler realized that although he wasn't the kind of analyst that touts only those stocks that his firm owns or does business with, he was still a Wall Street strawberry.  We can tell he figured this out because somewhere about three-quarters of the way into this very readable and engaging tome, he ups and leaves the comfy confines of Morgan Stanley and a six-figure plus income and begins to do his own investing.  That is, he actually bets on his own picks.  Wow.  Now understand that even here of course he hedges.  He forms his own capital management company; that is to say, he gets people to send him money which become chips that he shoves into the pot on their behalf.  If he wins, hurrah, and if the stocks he likes tank, well, he still gets paid. Kessler's is the latest in a long line of \"confessional\" books written by Wall Street people, almost always ex-Wall Street people--e.g., Where Are the Customers' Yachts? (1940) by Fred Schwed Jr.; License to Steal: the Secret World of Wall Street and the Systematic Plundering of the American Investor (1999) by Anonymous and Timothy Harper...etc.  Kessler's book stands out because he was an analyst, not a salesman (i.e., a \"broker\"), and because he worked with and knew many of the top people on the street and was well-regarded, but was not a top executive.  This is also an interesting personal story of a somewhat geek tech guy (but personable) who was smart enough and eventually hip enough to wow 'em in the presentations, who worked hard enough to be (I'm guessing) right more than half the time. Where his book is not among the best is in what he leaves out.  For some reason Kessler doesn't actually reveal how much he was paid (again I guessed at the six figures plus) or how well the stocks he touted performed, nor is he specific about how well he did with his own portfolio.  We realize when he gets to trading and discovers the market-maker's spread (Where did THAT come from?) that he really had little idea what life was like for the \"retail people\" who had to not only buck the spread but, before the rise of Internet trading, pay rather hefty commissions as well--which is why the customers never had any yachts.  But Kessler's reticence is probably just as well since everybody knows that there are two things people consistently lie about: sex and money.  Kessler doesn't mention the former and is vague about the latter.  I tend to respect that. Bottom line: unless you are Jack Grubman, Frank Quattrone, Henry Blodget and some of the other pieces of Wall Street Meat that Kessler writes about who went down with the ship, you will find this an amusing book, a nice diversion from a long, long time ago on which to reflect.  Kessler knows all the buzz words; he knows the players and (somewhat inadvertently) he lets us know him.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Stock Buffs guide to Real World Wall Street</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is an excellent book to lift the curtain and see what really goes on working as an analyst on the street.  This book is short, 200 pages,in big print, and makes a point of not taking itself too seriously as it describes a humorous, hard-working and deceptive Wall Street. Kessler was an engineer plucked from obscurity to become a stock analyst.  With simple but great advice from his boss, Kessler flies by the seat of his pants learning the business from 1985 to the mid 90s.  But what makes this book perfect is while he describes life on Wall Street and the many conflicts of interest as he learns the business, his Wall Street years were spent working along side many famous analyst who moved the market in the late 90s to the biggest stock market rally in history.  Jack Grubman is the most prominent and is described as a good friend, fun-loving guy of incredible talent who later in life controlled the telecom market possibly with questionable tactics.  Later he works with Frank Quattrone, known as the banker for the Internet.  As an analyst, Quattrone and Kessler were many times on opposite sides of client debates.  Kessler humorously describes their battles and debates while giving credit to Frank's unique talents and giving hints of how he might have helped in his downfall.  Mary Meeker and Henry Blodgett are also mentioned from a perspective few investors would see from just reading about them in magazines or newspapers. I can't over-emphasize how much fun this book is.  Many times authors try to tell you everything they know.  Kessler, possibly from experience writing concise research reports, does a great job of saying a lot without using many words wasting your time.  While this book will be good for anyone wanting to learn of the conflicts reseach analysts must face, it is a must read for novice or hobby stockpickers.  If nothing else but to show you the system you are working against.  I strongly recommend this book for all readers with interest in finance or the stock market.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Addiction helps Spanish learning.

But in these pages, Tom Stanton does a fine job of interweaving the story of Henry Aaron's chase of baseball's most hallowed record with the tale of the impact of that pursuit on the larger society. Stanton's love for the game shines through in this narrative, as does his sense of shame for those elements of the public who greeted Aaron's achievement not with praise, but scorn and hatred. The narrative begins in the fall of 1972 with Aaron among those  in attendance at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the color barrier in modern baseball. The bulk of the book tells the story of the 1973 season, which saw Aaron surpass Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list and finally fall one short of Ruth's magic total of 714. Over the course of that season Aaron had to endure the ravages of age (he was thirty-nine), a steadily intensifying media circus, and most disheartening of all, a vocal stream of hatred and abuse, most (if not all) of it racially motivated. The retrospective distance of three decades makes it clear that if anyone was prepared to endure this great strain, it was Henry Aaron. While other players in bigger media markets like Mays and Mickey Mantle had captured the public's imagination with flashier performances, Aaron had been toiling away in Milwaukee and Atlanta, steadily building up career totals that would place him in the first rank of baseball's Hall of Fame...and humanity's as well. Aaron came back for the 1974 season determined to put the quest for the record behind him as quickly as possible. This couldn't come without controversy, either. Atlanta officials found themselves embroiled in conflict with then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn when they threatened to hold Aaron out of the opening three games at Cincinnati so he could achieve the record at home. Under pressure from Kuhn, the Braves played Aaron in Cincinnati, where he tied the record. Fittingly, though, he saved the blast that put him alone in the baseball universe for the home fans. Appropriately, this is where Stanton's narrative ends. There's a brief afterword on what's happened to Aaron and the other key players (including a young acolyte of Aaron's, Dusty Baker) in the decades since. But the heart of the story is in that year and a half recounted in these pages....when, as Stanton puts it, Aaron placed an exclamation mark on Jackie Robinson's great achievement and helped further erode the barriers standing in the way of full equality for all Americans.--William C. Hall</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Fun, Informative History</td><td>4.0</td><td>In \"America's Prophet: Moses and the American Story,\" Bruce Feiler chronicles the sometimes surprising influence of Moses within American history.  \"Prophet\" strikes me as a fun, trivia-filled jaunt through American history with a little more depth than the History Channel but less than an academic textbook.  The Exodus motifs, he argues, of deliverance from oppression toward a \"there on the horizon\" Promised Land emerge again and again at key moments in the story of the United States. Feiler, a gifted wordsmith, carries us from the landing of Puritan pilgrims at Plymouth, Massachusetts through the American Revolution, the American Civil War, the immigration boom of the early 20th century to the Civil Rights movement.  Some parts of the story bog down in historical minutae but Feiler generally balances detail with scope, an important balance in a work of pop-level history.  Yet some of those details are quite memorable.  I had no idea that the largely Deist Founding Fathers - John Adams, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson - proposed the drowning of the Egyptian army during the Israelite exodus as the Great Seal of the United States.  The rich use of Exodus imagery used by slaves in the 18th century was no surprise, but the exploration of Mosaic themes during the boom of immigration to the U.S. in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was new territory.  I appreciated the connections Feiler made between the biblical concern for outsiders and strangers (everywhere evident in the Torah, the first five books of the Bible ascribed to Moses) and the assimilation of immigrants into America, symbolized in the erection of the Statue of Liberty.  Feiler doesn't often preach in \"Prophet,\" but at points such as this he can't resist: \"A society must gauge its worth not by power, the statue insists, but on how it treats its strangers\" (192). Though this is an entertaining and informative book in the cast of Stephen Prothero's \"American Jesus,\" I kept asking myself that all important question: so what?  As a preacher, I must wrestle with that question every week I sink myself into a biblical text.  It's incredibly difficult for me to resist that question when reading someone else tackling a biblical figure, even if his aim is somewhat different than my own. In the final chapter, Feiler steps into the pulpit, if only briefly.  He argues, \"You can't understand American history, I now believe, without understanding Moses.  He is a looking glass into our own soul\" (298).  He names three themes as to why this is.  First, Moses inspires \"the courage to escape oppression and seek the Promised Land\" (298).  Second, Moses' story exemplifies \"the tension between freedom and law\" (299).  Finally, the story of Moses and the liberated Israelites emphasizes \"the building of a society that welcomes the outsider and uplifts the downtrodden\" (300).  Perhaps with exasperation and hope, Feiler finally exclaims, \"We are as much a nation of strangers today as at any time in our history, and more in need of the unifying call Moses offers to free the suffering, build a nurturing community, and befriend the stranger\" (302). For all its good, \"Prophet\" ultimately left me more informed but frustrated.  What I see in Feiler's Moses-inspired chronicle of American history is a nation-state struggling to appreciate its past while moving toward that vaguely defined Promised Land of a brighter tomorrow.  As Feiler and many others have shown so clearly, the American understanding of \"the common good\" has been significantly shaped by Jewish-Christian values and the sacred books of those two religions, the Old and New Testaments.  And its clear that this so-called \"Judeo-Christian\" tradition still shapes the moral assumptions of many Americans.  However, there's also a clear move away from letting these traditions explicitly shape public policy and, I would argue, therefore, explicitly shaping a shared sense of what the common good look like. Feiler uncovers an important American ambiguity about the role of religion in public discourse.  Americans still use a religious motif - Moses and the Israelite Exodus - to tell the story of American progress, even as that story transgresses a biblical notion of the common good.  In other words, many of like the general themes of the Exodus as long as we don't take that God stuff too seriously. Feiler obviously has great admiration for his Jewish tradition, but I get the frustrating feeling that his commitment to American ideals threatens to whitewash the rich nuance of the Bible.  Worse yet, this way of telling history subtly submits the broad sweep of God's salvation history throughout the Bible to American history; the Bible becomes one more important piece of the great American pie.  The biblical God is replaced with the (American) \"universal God\" (238). When the biblical story becomes one stream feeding into the American river, Moses overshadows God and becomes the prototype for \"human possibility\" (308) or the prototypical leader (302).  For example, Feiler wonders in amazement why Moses is actually such a small part of the Torah (i.e. the first five books of the Bible).  We shouldn't be surprised by Moses' absence.  The story, after all, isn't about him!  The whole biblical story, including that of Moses, is about God, the one God bound and determined to save people.  That's why there's an Exodus.  That's why Moses was called - to be an actor (albeit an important one) in the drama of God's saving grace.  And that trumps the American story every time. \"America's Prophet\" is a worthy read.  It doesn't clear away the American ambiguity surrounding \"religion,\" but it does give a clearer picture of the past while holding out hope for a future Promised Land. *This review refers to the Advanced Reader's Edition made available by the publisher.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Sure to take its place next to A Christmas Carol and The Nutcracker</td><td>5.0</td><td>Outside, the afternoon grew darker, and the icy rain began to fall.

If Brittanys voice can charm us with echos of Dickens and Else Homelund Minarik, it can also shock and abhor us when it comes to Herrikhan. The contrast can be jolting at times which I think works in the stories favor, after all Herrikhan is horrifying, a brutality, cold and dark, come to invade the warmth and light we hold as Christmas. Holly Clause does what the great books of Christmas do it instills wonder, kindles the spirit and leaves us warm inside.

Deborah Lipstadt, an Emory University professor, wrote a book, \"Denying the Holocaust,\" ripping the lid off of critters who distort one history's most horrific episodes of genocide and organized slaughter, turning it upside down, presenting it as a hoax, making the victims into blood-sucking liars and the perpetrators into innocents or heroes. The purpose of denying the Holocaust, of course, is to make Nazism a legitimate political force and continue Jew-hating. Remove the Holocaust, and Nazism goes from being a genocidal sadistic kleptomania to a tough, rough, but viable form of ethnic nationalism, which builds good roads and fights Communism. After Professor Lipstadt published her book, one of the people she assailed (almost in passing), Englishman David Irving, whose career as a historian was on the downswing because of his open support of Holocaust denial, sued Prof. Lipstadt. Irving did so in a British court, which places a heavy burden on defendants -- they have to prove the plaintiff is wrong, instead of the plaintiff having to prove he is right. As matters turned out, Prof. Lipstadt whupped Irving pretty effectively. She assembled a crack team of historians, who presented reports that ripped Irving's research and knowledge of history bloody. Her barrister, Richard Rampton, tore Irving apart on the witness stand. At the end, the judge ruled for the defendants, shredding Irving's reputation as a historian, calling him a liar and a racist. Prof. Lipstadt's book is a fascinating, well-written account of her side of the trial, and three aspects of it jump out at the reader: one is the meticulousness with which she defended her right to free speech. (Irving offered to drop the suit for a $650 payment to a charity for disabled sailors and soldiers, as long as she and her publisher apologized and pulped the book. Prof. Lipstadt wasn't going to do that. Irving later used his \"offer\" as proof that he was being a nice guy, and the trial was all her fault.) Instead of buckling, Prof. Lipstadt assembled a team that said the simple thing: Irving was indeed a liar and a bully. The second aspect was the emotional ordeal Prof. Lipstadt went through through the trial, which alternated between the horrific (cross-examination about how Auschwitz worked) and the bizarre (cross-examination about Irving's links to neo-Nazis who insist that modern dancing be banned in favor of jigs and polkas) and the surreal (Irving addressing the judge as \"Mein Fuhrer\"). It was an immense struggle for Prof. Lipstadt, who often was physically and mentally exhausted by the stress. I cannot even begin to imagine how she held up. Knowing that you're on the side of truth is not enough. The third aspect was the bizarre nature of Irving's case -- throughout the text are her comments and those of her solicitor and barrister as to the strange stuff that Irving was spouting or including as evidence. The theory of his case was that Prof. Lipstadt was the pointed tip of a Jewish spear designed to destroy his reputation as a historian, but he did a fatuous job of doing so. The best he could do was produce a nutty California professor who said \"Jews stick together to create chaos.\" Prof. Lipstadt's side didn't even bother to cross-examine him. Irving also produced the highly esteemed British military historian Sir John Keegan, and didn't even bother to prep him, let alone meet him. Keegan took the stand and said, \"I'm here under subpoena, and think your idea that Hitler didn't know of the Holocaust is absurd and defies common sense.\" Irving tried to then impeach his own witness, failed, and Sir John was dismissed. In between, Irving did odd things, like present the plans for the PoW camp at Colditz, which showed a delousing shed, which somehow proved that Auschwitz \"deloused\" prisoners, not murder them. He also ridiculed the defense for not having a black lawyer on its team, while denouncing the BBC for having Sir Trevor MacDonald broadcasting the news (Sir Trevor is black), and saying he (Irving) had black female staffers, \"who have very nice breasts.\" Sometimes he came off as a pompous clown. He was most upset that he could not have his Darrow-Bryan moment of confronting Prof. Lipstadt on the stand, and presumably playing the role of Clarence Darrow, hoping he could break a Jewish woman into tears and confession a la Perry Mason. Oddly, I've read American analyses of Irving's case, and he could very easily have done better in an American courtroom. Irving, being ignorant of American law, misunderstood the Sullivan decision, and could have sued Prof. Lipstadt there. He could have hired an American lawyer on contingency to handle the case (better than Irving), and sat Prof. Lipstadt across from him during discovery to grill her about his theory that Prof. Lipstadt was the point of a Jewish conspiracy, and even cross-examined her. Ironically, Irving's prime argument, that the Holocaust didn't happen, would not have probably flown in American courtroom. An American judge would likely have simply tossed it, saying that was taking \"judicial notice\" that the Holocaust happened, and the only question would be Irving proving that Prof. Lipstadt had falsely and/or maliciously libeled him. But I don't think that Irving actually sued Prof. Lipstadt to win money or push Holocaust denial...he wasn't doing too well as a one-man book publishing enterprise, was getting negative publicity, couldn't sell his strange books too well, so he figured that by suing Prof. Lipstadt (and hopefully, winning), he could get back into the spotlight he craves, get taken seriously as a serious historian again, and sell his books. He actually did get that -- he got a lot of media interviews after the trial was over, and his catastrophic closing argument was more aimed at shoring up and impressing his supporters than winning over the judge. But in the end, he drew more ridicule than applause, and many of his confreres in anti-Semitism were annoyed that he didn't call them to testify as \"experts on his behalf. Instead of being known as a \"great\" historian, he's universally described as a \"disgraced\" or \"racist\" historian. Prof. Lipstadt writes movingly and powerfully of this incredible struggle for truth and emotional ordeal, with rigor, gravitas, humor, and restraint. She showed incredible courage and determination in the face of vicious cynicism, hypocrisy, and raw evil. Hers is a book that should be read now and for all time.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Excellent book!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Excellent book!

Deborah's wit and ability to articulate the various stages in an authentic and lively way made it not only an important work but interesting to read. I can't count the times I smacked my forehead and blasphemed at Irving's stupidity and bizarreness. Um, ultimately uncle Adolf was NOT an antisemite but the best friend the Jews had?? No doubt the pustules that continue to support him will cook up word-soups in an effort to salvage him from this, but he is exposed for what he is. It was hard to get my head around why a man who told deliberate lies would sue somebody thus risking his lies being exposed; that seemed counter-intuitive to me. But it became apparent through reading the book that Irving is a couple of sausage rolls short of a packed lunch. This case portrays a man who is delusional about his own greatness; he sees himself as a messiah of sorts and perhaps believed that he would get away with the twaddle he peddles. To say nothing of his view of himself as a poor, beleagured martyr/victim of those nasty, greedy, conspiratorial Jews. I may cry. From a personal point of view: He should rot in a very warm place for his treatment of Holocaust survivors - gleeful spiteful treatment that he's actually proud of. Scumbag. He shot himself well and truly in the foot this time. Utterly recommended.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Stupid book</td><td>1.0</td><td>I read a lot, some good and some bad.

I was a bit perplexed when the book barely even mentioned the Final Solution against the Jews, and how it generally whitewashed Hitler's role in this and other Nazi atrocities. I didn't dwell on it at the time, and only learned later that Irving is an unabashed Hitler apologist, who has been mostly discredited as a historian, and who is prone to conspiracy theorizing and suing his critics. This book is by a credible historian that Irving sued for libel, Deborah Lipstadt, who published convincing evidence that he is a \"holocaust denier.\" This book covers the trial that, due to the procedures of British law, became not just a defense against libel accusations but a debate on the history of the holocaust itself. Lipstadt and her publisher emerged victorious, due to the sheer weight of the evidence from history, proving that it was not libel to make the extremely obvious claim that Irving is a \"holocaust denier.\" That certainly makes this book worthwhile, but there are some problems with Lipstadt's reporting on the trial. I agree with some other reviewers in that she is quite self-centered, describing how she kept second-guessing her lawyers and the judge almost every day. She frequently criticizes the judge for treating Irving's court tactics in an evenhanded or impartial fashion, as if it were not his job to follow courtroom procedures in a respectable way. Lipstadt also often complains about the unfavorable differences between British and American law, which all turns out to be little more than melodrama, because she already announced at the start of the book that she would eventually win the case. More fundamentally, Lipstadt recounts the trial testimony to such a detailed extent that this book becomes (inadvertently, I assume) a verbose condemnation of Irving's views and conclusions. This detracts from the book's supposed theme of justice, to a painfully obvious rebuttal of Irving's work. This was not entirely necessary because Irving's errors speak for themselves, as seen in the outcome of the case. There are some interesting allusions to the differences between selective interpretation (Irving) and convergence of evidence (everyone else) in the art of history, but this is mostly lost under Lisptadt's frequent self-aggrandizement about the righteousness of her struggle. Lipstadt did a great thing for truth and justice by fighting off Irving's desperate attacks, but there could have been better ways to report on this important trial.

I started reading when I got on a bus at 1 PM, and finished the book at about 6 or 7 (despite napping for an hour or so in the middle of a journey). Other reviewers have adequately discussed this book's coverage of the Irving/Lipstadt trial: but I was also interested in learning about the toll litigation can take on the time and energy of even a victorious party. After reading this book, I am definitely more supportive than before of American libel law (which typically places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show falsity, and provides that public figures can only recover if they show that their opponent was truly reckless): Britian's pro-plaintiff libel law, by encouraging libel suits, caused both Mr. Irving and Ms. Lipstadt to subject themselves to levels of scrutiny that I suspect few scholarly reputations could survive. One minor point: I wish Lipstadt had included some of the relevant documents (in particular, Irving's initial complaint) in the appendix so readers could follow exactly what the parties needed to prove.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>A dark comedy Christmas</td><td>5.0</td><td>Raziel is back, and has been entrusted with a mission: grant a child's Christmas wish.

I loved it. Many of the characters were apparently resurrected (unfortunate choice of words) from other books by Moore, but a reader does not have to have read these earlier works to grow to love-or fear-the...uh...eccentric population of Pine Cove, California. Only the cemetery people (don't want to give too much away here) were a tad on the unlikable side, but I think that was probably Moore's intent, so that's not really a criticism. The plot builds logically (ironic, huh?) and suspensfully, and the final battle scene is delicious. Christmas simply won't be the same again. If you love irreverence, sarcasm, and situations that seem to actually make sense in their ridiculousness, you'll love The Stupidest Angel.

If you are similarly inclined, this book may be for you.  If you're seeking a history of burlesque or fetish art, you should probably look elsewhere--while there are some historical details strewn throughout the text, most of the narrative is autobiographical.  Dita von Teese led an interesting life, by her account, so this aspect of the book is no detriment.  Even more of the book consists of full-page photographs of von Teese in various costumes: some of them dazzlingly beautiful, some of them extremely revealing, and all of them eye-catching.  Almost every page contains an image of von Teese looking glamorous.  She never wears the same costume twice.  Furthermore, each chapter devotes a page to tips for capturing the style of a female beauty archetype from a particular decade of the twentieth century: the vamp of the 1920s, the film siren of the 1930s, etc.  By the way, these tips tend to assume that the reader's skin isn't dark--she who wishes to emulate a vamp authentically, for example, must have deathly pale skin--so one may need to either modify these lists or disregard them altogether. The aforementioned narrative section is what prevents me from assigning this book a higher rating, but not because of von Teese's autobiographical focus.  Her choice to write about her personal past is not a problem.  The author's sexual politics are what really detract from my enjoyment of the book.  In the conclusion to the \"Burlesque\" half, she states that some people ask her whether her act incorporates any feminist elements.  Her reply is that it does IF you define feminism as she does, which is to be as feminine as possible.  In other words, the answer is no.  Obviously, no one was expecting her to say yes.  She's a burlesque performer.  Burlesque is a fantasy release, and fantasies do not necessarily take the realities of life into account.  They're make-believe.  Why she won't simply be honest about her line of work and say, \"There's nothing feminist about burlesque, but it's still a lot of fun,\" is baffling and frustrating. Similarly, the \"Fetish\" side is also problematic.  I take no issue with von Teese's preference for playing the damsel in distress in her bondage scenarios; again, it's a classic fantasy.  The sentence that raised my ire was this: \"I think that if we could admit that everyone enjoys seeing a naked woman, the world would be a better place.\" Anyone old enough to be reading this book knows that this viewpoint is patently untrue.  Then again, as evidenced by her reaction to LYSISTRATA at the beginning of the \"Burlesque\" section, Miss von Teese doesn't seem to want to admit that some men simply aren't attracted to women, just as a few of the photographs in the \"Fetish\" section point toward a trivialization of female homosexuality--as in, they use lesbian implications solely for heterosexual male arousal, a concept that von Teese apparently not only finds acceptable but expects readers to accept as well.  On a related note, the gay men who do appreciate women's beauty usually like to see them *clothed*. For those of you who think I've been taking this book too seriously, I invite you to look at the list of von Teese's recommended books in the \"Fetish\" section.  It contains, among other entries, the Marquis de Sade's JUSTINE and Anton LaVey's THE SATANIC WITCH.  The former, far from being a \"sane, safe, and consensual\" adventure, happily details a woman being tortured nearly to death dozens of times, and the latter is a second-person anti-feminist manifesto that tells women that they should welcome men treating them as sex objects.  If these are the books that von Teese deems worthy of recommendation, then she either hasn't read them or is deliberately sending unambiguous messages about what she considers her own--and, by extension, all women's--proper place in relation to men. In summary, if BURLESQUE AND THE ART OF THE TEESE/FETISH AND THE ART OF THE TEESE were simply an adults-only coffee table book with makeup and costuming tips and some autobiographical tidbits, I would give it a four-star rating.  As it is, I find it too offensive to endow it with a full recommendation.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Death bumbler!</td><td>3.0</td><td>Ok, I have to admit was enjoying the book until the last 25 percent. It felt like the author was under the gun and pushed to end it. Annoying parts of the story, author kept stressing the beta male theory like it was an explanation for stupidity. That came into play about 75 percent through the book. Essentially beta males are what prolonged the species through pity sex. A beta male has great imagination but little to no self respect and likes to fatasize about getting the better woman and taking what one can get. Second annoying part was towards the end and I do have to spoil this because it had me disgusted. Essentially Charlie finds out that the evil harpy demons from the sewers got stronger because the bimbo Buddhist who was taking the souls that they were collecting in the objects was pushing the human souls into dead animal parts and having them steal other souls since she was under the misguided conclusion that Charlie and other death merchants were evil. Now major problem with this is that she was using animated dead animals to spy but jumped the gun and started the apocalypse by making evil stronger. Since Charlie is a beta male he overlooks this bimbo Buddhist shortcomings like starting the apocalypse and sleeps with her. She is essentially responsible for souls being eaten, animating dead animal parts with human souls, stopping people from dying, and essentially playing god.

These books usually have a great lesson to teach, and a fun story to tell. THIS book only told a story, NO the trademark Berenstain Bears lesson, and not a very good story, at that. The worst part was how mamma forced the cubs to eat vegetables with their dinners-- the story presented it as though no kid would ever want to eat a vegetable. My kids love vegetables (not that they don't love fries), I don't want them hearing Brother Bear saying \"why do vitamins have to taste so bad?\" What's the point in trying to make it harder for kids to eat well? I HATE when books or tv shows do this. Even though my family is pretty traditional, it bothered me that the whole deal was that mamma was tired from doing all the home and child care, so papa decided to treat her to a night out. As the previous reviewer, I just changed a few words for that. I used to buy Berenstain books on the name alone, I trusted them to be good. Now I'll have to check reviews first when possible.

The premise sounded intriguing, but there were so many moments where I just rolled my eyes and though, \"are you kidding?\"  I easily identified Moore's attempts to be clever, but it just didn't come off as funny.  The contrast of such a dark subject with humor and witty banter felt contrived like a mishmash of Dave Barry and Anne Rice.  Charlie's fiendish supernatural pursuers were obnoxious and the underworld mythology lent to the ridiculousness.  While I liked many of the characters, their motives and actions lacked common sense.  Moore's identification of Charlie as a Beta Male turned into a theme that could have been funnier if it wasn't so redundant.  The interpretation on the afterlife lacked any degree of faith and hope, which is at the heart of many people's beliefs. There is despair in the idea that souls are relegated to inanimate objects. Overall, it was a mildly funny supernatural thriller that lacked suspense and had a pretty obvious conclusion.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Love it</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've only ever seen the movie before now, so when I found this in the secondhand shop I simply had to grab it.

Kidder argues against moral relativism, suggesting (based on interviews) that honesty, respect, responsibility, fairness, and compassion are universal values. These are just words, however, and they can mean very different things to different people. To people in a very communal culture, responsibility might be used to mean the individual's responsibility to the community. In more individualistic cultures (and in the philosophy of Ayn Rand) it would more likely mean responsibility to self. To some fairness means equality, while to others it can mean extreme discrimination. A refutation of moral relativism demands that different people agree upon the same meanings, not merely the same words. With this failure, Kidder's entire case falls down. He presents moral courage as \"the string\" holding together the pearls (of moral values). When those very values are in question, moral courage becomes undefinable.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>An important topic no matter what your station in life</td><td>4.0</td><td>Take a look at your hometown newspaper on any given day.

Or maybe a group of high school students have been caught plagiarizing their term papers.  How do you react when you read these kinds of stories?  Are you outraged or do you merely shrug your shoulders and yearn for the \"good old days\" when people were more responsible and more accountable for their actions. As we enter the increasingly complex world of the 21st century, it has become quite apparent that there is a need for more and more of us to display \"Moral Courage\".  Much to my amazement, author Rushworth Kidder reveals in the opening pages of his book that a search on the internet revealed that no one has ever written a book on this specific subject.  To Kidder there are three elements to \"Moral Courage\"--an individual must have principles, there has to be an element of danger or risk involved and one must show a willingness to endure.  As a means of illustration, the author cites numerous real-life examples of individuals who found themselves facing very real ethical dilemmas.  Some of his subjects would fail the test miserably while others would respond in a heroic way.  Kidder goes on to explain that the most difficult moral dilemmas are not those situations where the choices are clearly \"right against wrong\" but rather the situation that commonly occurs where one must struggle with \"right vs. right\" choices. I cannot think of anyone who would not benefit from reading \"Moral Courage\".  Like it or not, each one of us is bound to face a number of thorny issues and moral dilemmas during the course of our lifetime.  Rushworth Kidder has given us all lots of food for thought in his fascinating new book.

In the first, the comedy is the foundation.  Anything that can be inserted to confirm the framework will find a place - somehow.  Using humour to enhance an idea or lighten an approach is often welcome.  Using humour as an additional aspect of developing a story requires more finesse and care than having comedy as a starting point.  Moore, who possess a delightful wit, and a fine sense of story-telling, has created a comedy novel.  While its topic, the existence and handling of souls, might seem to be a serious matter, in Moore's hands it becomes merely a foundation upon which to exercise his skills at jollity. Charlie Asher has inherited a second-hand clothing store in San Francisco, The City of Two Bridges.  He's also suffered the devastating loss of his wife in childbirth.  The sight of a black man clad in a bizarre green outfit in his wife's room initiates a further turn in Charlie's life.  Alone, almost, with his new daughter, Charlie tries to rebuild his shattered life.  Other deaths, some right in the streets of The City, have a certain intimate relation to him.  Particularly when some of the departed appear to have been sent on their way by his daughter. Charlie manages to track down the man in the green suit.  He is also a dealer in second-hand goods - music CDs.  It turns out these items and certain of those in Charlie's establishment have special properties.  They carry the souls of certain of the dead.  The items are in these stores in order to be conveyed to new owners.  The man in green, \"Minty Fresh\", tells Charlie he's one of San Francisco's half-dozen \"Death Merchants\".  They are located there [and elsewhere as it turns out], because The City of the Two Bridges will be invaded by the Forces of Darkness if they fail in their task.  They are but temporary stand-ins for the Real Death - the one with a capital \"D\" who is due along at some future time.  Since Moore has depicted Charlie as a \" Beta male\" [thus displaying his ability to keep up to date with the latest theories of evolutionary psychology], we are given a West Coast version of Woody Allen without the scandals.  Charlie would like a more elevated status.  What more logical promotion than to rise above being merely a Death Merchant.  He decides he's Luminatus, the real Death, and struggles to assume the role. In depicting Charlie's coming to understand who and what the Luminatus is and what is expected of Death as a force, Moore is at his best.  Charlie's awareness grows through various events, including the death of his own mother.  Charlie encounters the Forces of Darkness - in fact, one tries to seduce him in an alley.  As the Luminatus, he knows it's his job to defeat them, if he can only learn how.  He even gains support of a sort from an SFPD Inspector, who seems mildly interested in \"weird\" events.  Charlie's major vulnerability is his daughter, Sophie.  She matures wondrously as the book skips over several years.  Charlie tries to help along her development through a series of unfortunate episodes dealing with animal pets.  The problem is finally solved by the unexpected acquisition of a pair of huge dogs - hellhounds. To anybody even slightly versed in the fantasy genre, these monstrous canines give away the game.  Why are they so defensive of Sophie?  They are omnipresent, except when lured away by somebody [something?] aware of their predelictions.  And they are an endless source of amusing anecdotes by Moore's depiction of Charlie attempting to explain them.  In stories of \"magical realism\", the fantasy world hovers close to the real world, just out of sight.  In San Francisco, the Forces use the sewer system, which, in Moore's hands, make the Paris system seem simplistic.  Charlie must meet them on their own ground, and it's clear he's poorly equipped to deal with the challenge.  He needs better support than a mildly sceptical copper, and sure enough, someone arrives to save the day.  Who that is must be left for the reader to learn.  A quick glance at the book's dust jacket or any chapter heading suggests the answer.  That's a bit of a surprise on the publisher's part.  And gives the ending a rather formulaic aroma.  Getting to this point, however, is part of Moore's genius.  In most ways, the book is a fine cliffhanger.  It excels much of his other work in some ways, falling short in others.  It's a must for Moore fans and a great read for anybody who likes inventive writing.

At least he was normal, until the day he accidentally walked in on Death--well actually, one of his minions, the dapper and cool Minty Fresh--and finds himself as one of Death's Little Helpers as well, collecting the souls from the newly departed and saving these souls from unscrupulous use by a set of female demons and their wicked lord. Once Charlie gets the hang of it, he finds out that it's not such a bad job, makes him a decent living and gives him plenty of time with his daughter Sophie. There's just one flaw. . . it seems that the Sewer Harpies (as Charlie comes to call the female demons) are growing stronger. So strong in fact, that there will be no other course of action than a ferocious battle for the world, between the forces of good and evil. Charlie is alternatively helped and hindered on his path by the sort of wonderful characters only Moore could create. There's Lily, the wise-cracking teenaged Goth and \"creepiness child prodigy\" (who quickly became my favorite), and Ray, an ex-police officer searching for love on Asian dating sites. Charlie's sister Jane -the Alpha Male that Charlie isn't- gives Charlie strength and love--all the while looking better in his suits than he does. Even Charlie's daughter Sophie, who grows up before our eyes, has some odd tendencies--bad luck with pets, one very dangerous word, her own personal hounds from hell and the typical child's memory for things that one was not supposed to hear in the first place. Of course, one couldn't expect her to be completely normal, given her father (who was convinced he saw a tail on her six-month sonogram) and the influence of her unintentional hilarious babysitters, Mrs. Korjev (and her bears) and Mrs. Ling (and her wok). Even Charlie's enemies are wonderful; I adored the Sewer Harpies with their bickering, evil ways, puppet shows and continually amusing antics. In addition, Moore throws in a few return characters from other books which was a thrill for the Moore fan. I was especially glad to see the Emperor again. Charlie's experiences as a soul collector are both funny and touching. As is so often the case with Mr. Moore, a surprising tenderness turned up on some scenes. There is one scene in particular (the cheese scene--read it and you'll agree with me), that made me step back and say, \"Wow! I need to be sure I appreciate life to the fullest!\". Terminal illness, hospice care, nurses, and death all received a reverential treatment at his hands--while still being funny in that twisted Moore way. A Dirty Job has overtaken Lamb as my favorite Christopher Moore novel and rates a full five stars. Pick it up and join Charlie the life of death.

Some, such as the playfully defiant \"Faith and Hope Go Shopping\" are surprisingly realistic while others embrace Harris's trademark fascination with fairy-tale lore and magic realism.  \"Gastronomicon\" unfolds as a young wife decides to experiment with recipes near the end of the ancient cookbook given to her by her mysterious mother-in-law.  \"Ugly Sister\" and \"The Little Mermaid\" re-tell fairy tales in a more modern, more twisted way.  \"Class of 1981\" explores, as Harris says, \"what happens when the magic runs out . . .\"  Some stories are little more than conceits - in the final story \"Eau de Toilette\" we meet a parfumier of another time who just happens to be someone famous.  This uneven collection remains an exhilarating read, mostly because Harris seems prepared to try anything, to slyly poke fun at expectations and cultural traditions. I wish that Harris had not chosen to preface each story with a short explanation of why she wrote it; it takes the magic out of the illusion.  Once the reader gets into these stories, however, he'll find them witty and much more vibrant than the bland introductions.  Even those stories which cry out for greater development, or a less-than-rushed ending, will charm readers with their originality.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Dahl Classic</td><td>5.0</td><td>...have been fond of Roald Dahl ever since I read \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" in second grade, but I never got around to reading Matilda until now. This is a fantastic book, and is easily one of Dahl's best, with his trademark loveable, oddball characters and sense of invention and wonder...what startled me most about this book was that Dahl included some very mature themes in the final few chapters. Without giving away any plot twists (and believe me, there are some good ones here), the issue of child abuse is brought up. The characters don't dwell on it, but for a mature reader like myself who has seen children's entertainment deteriorate into mindless, sugar-coated garbage, it's refreshing to see such things mentioned. Young children will realize the seriousness of what is being said but won't be overtaken by it, which seems like the ideal way to make them aware of these issues. Thank you, Mr. Dahl, for reminding us of a time when children's stories could be both fun and meaningful. On a lighter note, I'm getting more used to Quentin Blake's new illustrations. While I'd still prefer to see copies of Dahl's novels with their original drawings, Blake's style fits Matilda quite well, and even gives Miss Honey her due and makes her really pretty. All in all, Matilda is a book for everyone, and adults will enjoy reading this book to their children.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A well-dressed mystery--</td><td>5.0</td><td>When I was thirteen, my Mama took me to our local library and introduced me to her favorite authors. These were the acknowledged masters of the \"Golden Age of Mystery Novels\"-Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Ngaio Marsh, Rex Stout, Dorothy Sayers, Erle Stanley Gardner, Mary Roberts Rinehart, etc. They kept me busy-and reading-for a good many years. In fact, I still go back to them, with great anticipation, and am seldom ever disappointed. Even the occasional anachronisms are fun! How then, could I pass up \"I dreamed I married Perry Mason\"?  I couldn't, it's that simple. I rather like the trend of using real (older) characters in new books, as long as it's done in a sensible fashion. Here, the author really does a great job of telling us more about the man, Erle Stanley, and his various series of books. I loved the Donald Lam/Bertha Cool books as much as those about Perry Mason and Della Street. I knew nothing about the earlier books, which makes me want to go find them. CeCe Caruso is a delightful, mature lady-not an oldster, by any means, but not a young chick, either. Thank goodness! She's bright, and insecure, and persistent-admirable qualities, all. Her love of vintage clothing is an added fillip. One wonders which of today's fashionistas will be so celebrated in 40 years as the great names of the previous century. CeCe has a career, too, as a biographer whose books are actually published. Good for her! When she gets stuck mid-way through her 6th book-about Erle Stanley-she stumbles over an intriguing letter to the Court of Last Resort, an offshoot of Gardner's early career as an attorney. The clues to the mystery involved are scattered throughout, but not blatantly displayed, leaving the reader to wonder a bit. The research involved is awesome in its complexity, and presented in a very accessible manner. The secondary characters-and the plots in which they are involved-are an exotic bunch, but after all, they do live in La-La land! The writing is terrific: engaging and extremely descriptive with ample humor, as well. CeCe isn't afraid to occasionally deride herself or her foibles, but never gets maudlin about it.

Given the cost of materials and tools, some things just don't seem worth making. I wish there were more simple, clever ideas for adding Modern design to your home, that don't require a lot of money, skill, tools, or a work space. The instructions and photos are sometimes confusing or incomplete, making them hard to follow. The one thing I like about this book is that Oldham talks about important Modern designers like Isamu Noguchi and Eva Zeisel, but I'm already familiar with their work, so this didn't teach me anything.

On pages 288-289 the authors discuss the special election that was held in The Bronx's 24th CD in February, 1948 which was won by Henry Wallace supporter, Leo Isaacson. Certain assertions about that election were not true. The authors wrote that the election was held as a result of the incumbent's untimely passing. Actually the incumbent, Bernard Rabin, was elected to a 14 year term on the NYS State Supreme Court in the 1947 general election and resigned his House seat to take on his judgeship, thus giving rise to the vacancy and special election. He did not die--I was at the Bronx-Manhattan Democrat judicial convention, held at the Coucourse Plaza Hotel in September, 1961 at which he was renominated. Isaacson's Democrat opponent, Karl Propper, was his perfect foil in that election. (An aside, Propper's wife was a source for Robert Caro on the early life of Robert Moses for which she was given credit in \"The Power Broker\".) Propper was the attorney for the Bronx landlord's trade association and as such handled all the evictions for Bronx landlords during the 1930s. His name was featured on all the eviction papers--not a pretty thing during the Depression and was still remembered in 1948. (The Bronx Democrat organization, for all its closeness to FDR under Ed Flynn, was still the place where \"establishment\" [not so liberal] types found a home. Karl Propper typified them.) Leo Isaacson was an Assemblyman at the time of his election, but from the opposite side of The Bronx, representing a district that consisted of Riverdale and West Kingsbridge. He was elected as a coalition candidate of the Republicans and the American Labor Party (like East Harlem Congressman Vito Marcantonio and NYC Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, strange as that might seem today). Yes, the Truman administration's posture on what was then called \"Palestine\" was an issue but it was not the only one. Yes, there was a large Jewish population in that district but there were also large pockets of Irish-American voters in Port Morris (where labor leader George Meany grew up), Polish voters in Hunts Point and black voters such as the parents of Secretary of State Colin Powell in the Southern Boulevard--Intervale Avenue and Prospect Avenue part of the district. Special election, being the low turnout affairs that they are, the most motivated turned out and elected Leo Isaacson on the American Labor Party ticket. The assertion that the 24th CD was some kind of \"red belt\" is simply untrue. Isaacson was the only ALP candidate who ever was elected there on that line alone. Although the American Labor Party did get more votes there than in most other districts and it is true that leftism was, as Norman Podhoretz puts it, \"in the fog\" of that district the ALP was always a minority voice as was its offshoot, the Liberal Party. The working class Jews there belonged to anti-communist unions such as the ILGWU and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union which had, as the Radoshes stated, withdrew their support from the American Labor Party after it was taken over by the Communists and formed the New York State Liberal Party. However, the main point that the election was seen as a warning sign that failure by Truman to support the creation of Israel would harm his election prospects a few months later was absolutely true and the fact that Ed Flynn was at the White House right after that special election attests to that fact! But for the foregoing, it was an accurate and great book.

The title is taken from the children's rhyme to remember how to spell Mississippi.  This book has layers of mystery--murder mystery and family mystery both past and present.

Larry is white and is an awkward kid who does not fit in with his classmates or his family.  He grows up to inherit his father's automotive shop but he has no customers.  Silas is the town constable.  He is black and was a baseball star in high school and college.  He returns to Chabot after military service.  Larry and Silas have a complicated past.  In high school, Larry takes a popular girl on a date.  She is never seen again and Larry is accused of killing her, though he was never convicted due to lack of proof.  Nonetheless, his life is ruined in the small town and he is the victim of gossip and harassment.  In the present, a local college girl goes missing and Larry is accused of killing her.  Again, no evidence is found.  Eventually the truth comes out, but there are a lot of wounds in the process. The novel moves back and forth in time and alternates between the perspectives of Silas and Larry.  The mysteries slowly unfold and they both find friendship and the beginnings of redemption.  The atmosphere of the \"Deep South\" was well done in my opinion.  The story was very compelling.  I could have read this in a couple of days if my schedule allowed.

That time out of mind, the intensity of experience cannot be regained once they return to the city, only remembered. A plastic surgeon has the power to change lives. He loves his work, sculpting perfection into the human form. But, careful as he is, mistakes, misjudgments are made, the psychological sabotaging of the results of his scalpel. People are, after all, victims of their own perceptions, sometimes unable to allow themselves the joy, the opportunities of their new lives. Part of the housekeeping staff at the Echo Terrace condominiums, Yesenia is only nineteen, her whole life yawning before her. One evening, lost in the dark beauty of the city, she waits too long to start home and darkness falls, rendering the streets more dangerous. She finds herself alone on the subway, a young man stalking her. All of these people, and more, are part of the complex humanity of Echo Terrace, where Farro Fescu is the concierge, a Rumanian lover of lists. Disappointed in life, but burdened with a romantic soul, Fescu finds comfort and direction in his lists, a manner of managing chaos, keeping track of all his charges and their needs. Too easily he becomes mired in his disappointments; the lists soothe him, allow him to cease struggling. Rinaldi's characters are complex, challenging stereotypes, full of the dichotomies that plague most people, the ambiguity of routine, the occasional prick of conscience, the distance of real passion or emotion; they act out their roles, playing the parts they are assigned, indistinguishable in this respect. But their interiors are jumbled and patched, unrecognizable from their everyday selves. Inside, reality plays havoc with their souls. Those who live in Echo Terrace are well-off, urbane, and proud to be a part of the bustle of New York. Those who work there, the shadow-people, entertain more cautious expectations. In this place, the author has built a sculpture of personalities, each a new armature attached to the body that defines the form, like branches from a tree, interconnected. Just as people affect each other in immeasurable ways, this entity changes minutely, a living piece. If Echo Terrace is the matrix, all those who live there contribute to the dimensions. Finally, they are united in purpose, grateful to have survived their city on that terrible day in September that changes the world forever.

I thought his previous novel, The Jukebox Queen of Malta, was one of the better books of the year in 2000. Rinaldi has followed up that success with another blockbuster novel.  Set in a Battery Park condo, Between Two Rivers is an expertly woven quilt of a novel that brilliantly illuminates the subtle bonds that develop between people who, by chance or by choice, happen to live together. The story revolves around one Farro Fescu, the inimitable Romanian concierge, who watches with keen eyes the comings and goings of the intriguing inhabitants of Echo Terrace, as the building is called.  The building's name itself conjures up the themes that permeate this book-memory and shared experience.  It is through this wonderfully energetic and nosy concierge that Mr. Rinaldi introduces the other residents, each with a wonderfully engaging and, often, enigmatic story to tell. The condo's residents mirror the ethnic, intense and farcical nature of New York.  Although a novel in format, the construction of the book approached that of a collection of short stories in some respects as Rinaldi explores the inner workings and motivations of each character, but he always segues adroitly back into novel mode as he approaches the interrelationships and dynamics of the Echo Terrace's emotional and interrelational ecology. This is a book with first rate characters, elegant writing, dynamic construction and, ultimately, a book that provides one with a tremendous sense of satisfaction. Rinaldi just gets better and better.  We can only hope he has many mode books in him.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Changed the Style</td><td>2.0</td><td>My daughter loves the Biscuit books.

Her focus in this book is trauma, from the most personal and emotional to the most global, i.e. The World Trade Center Disaster.  Her elucidation of the psychological is center stage in all of her stories.  Each story depicting a truly personal trauma, the book takes the reader through the pain and effects of the death of parents, the influence of serious mental illness, the difficult love and emotional interactions of a student who is seduced by a teacher and many other topics that reflect what we have seen going on in the American Society in the last decade. Always, there is the ever present hardscrabble existence of those in the Upstate New York environment, the struggle to make a living, and the struggle just to live with the prevailing conditions of the region.  The struggle to live and live with one's own thoughts and experiences is truly brought to the surface. From a writing standpoint this book finds Joyce at the apex of her short story writing career.  The stories are carefully crafted, with the use of multiple literary techniques.  Her use of phrases to highlight and illustrate specific intensities of thought and feeling are wonderfully blended with a writing style that grips the reader like a pipe wrench.  The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters time after time.  Her stories do not always resolve, leaving the reader to extrapolate the future of the characters.  The pictures she paints with her words are explicit and the most intense examples of human reality.  This reality is mixed most explicitly with the internal feeling of most of the characters that they are unique and that they are \"No One You Know.\" The book is recommended for all serious readers of modern literature.

Her carefully crafted facade is just vulnerable enough to allow for her journey from street urchin to the ultimate best friend. The reader intimately feels her hurts, both physical and emotional. As Xhea risks her life to save an unlikely friend, she must learn how to manage a dark magic that is as rare as her ability to see ghosts, all while pitting herself against the forces of a society she wishes would both save her and leave her alone. One of the first lines that grabbed me is: Never before had she felt a ghosts presence like a bruise in midair. This is how I feel about the forthcoming second book of the series.

He can keep cranking out amusing books set in Pine Cove and San Francisco, and I will joyfully continue reading them.  But it is the rarer and more challenging works (such as his prior novel LAMB) that I really look forward to with relish. Fool is Moore's take on Shakespeare in general and King Lear in particular.  Once again, Moore has set himself the challenge of finding the comedy in an epic tragedy.  In Fool, now that I think of it, he uses a device similar to the one he used in LAMB--a charming and ridiculous narrator.  This is Lear told from the point of view of the court jester, Pocket, a character as endearing as any that Moore has written.  Through Pocket's eyes we learn more about the goings on in Castle Lear than we have been privy to in the past.  And, we learn the fool's own fascinating life story.  It is possible that devotees of the Shakespearean original did not realize that the Lear household actually revolved around the fool? I don't know that there's much point in giving you a Cliff's Notes version of the plot.  Lear was the elderly king of all Britain.  As the play/novel opens, he has decided to divide his kingdom among his three adult daughters.  The division will be determined by who loves him the most.  (That's fair, right?)  The two eldest, Goneril and Regan flatter him mightily.  Only the youngest, Cordelia, speaks truthfully and modestly of her love for her father.  But her sincerity is lost on Lear.  He flies into a rage.  He disinherits Cordelia and divides the kingdom between Goneril and Regan and their respective husbands.  Lear's best friend Kent says, \"Hey, this is crazy.  What are you doing?\" and gets banished for his trouble.  And so it begins, eventually leading to murder, war, madness, and so forth.  This ringing any bells? You may be asking, \"Where's the fool?\"  That's just it.  Pocket is everywhere.  He's telling the story.  He is the witness to it all.  He knows the entire back story, has all the family secrets, knows how those three girls lost their virginity, etc.  And you know that's going to come up, because this is a Christopher Moore novel, after all.  Shakespeare may be hallowed ground to some, but Chris Moore isn't above throwing in a little bathroom humor, some gratuitous sex, and a joke or two that'll make you groan.  Actually, I don't think Will Shakespeare was above any of those devices himself.  Some of the humor is terribly erudite and sophisticated and some is well, idiotic.  (Literally, as it happens.)  Say what you will, this novel is laugh-out-loud funny! I'll be honest, there were times when the mixture of comedy and tragedy clashed a little uncomfortably for me.  It's a freakin' depressing story, y'all!  But Moore's twisted take on Shakespeare and his obvious love and respect for the Bard are all but brilliant.  Bravo, Chris!

If Short was involved with them, the author also makes no connection between Ms. Short's medical issues and his father the physician...I would have expected the vast amounts of information about her medical 'stuff' to be bought up in the book.  Also very little is said about the nurse who 'committed suicide' and her connections to his father as well... Long book, lots to read...I guess that is why there is a part 2 now?

RADIANT is a book full of wonderful things, and there is so much about it that I love. I love the detail that the author has built into the world that has grown out of the remains of a ruined city. The tiny elements of world-building that lurk in crannies and around corners like the mysterious creatures heard shuffling around the streets at night. I love how the author explores ideas of morality, the contrasting worlds of light and dark, as the shining towers of the City above contrast with the ruined skyscrapers and caved-in subway tunnels of the Lower City. The Lower City lives and breathes -- its sights, smells, textures, and tastes present both in vibrant colour and in the shades of grey seen through the eyes of our protagonist. But more than anything, I love the friendship between Xhea and Shai that forms the heart of the book. Two wildly different young women from two entirely different worlds, who would never have been friends in life, connected after Shai's death by a bond that surpasses the boundaries of the job for which they were originally brought together and becomes something wonderful and new. These are beautifully realized characters with hopes, dreams, faults, and flaws, and watching their friendship as it blossomed organically between them was my favourite part of a story full of wonder, mystery, fear, intrigue, and adventure. With an ending that resolves just enough to be satisfying in a way that makes you sigh as you close the book, while simultaneously whetting your appetite for the next book and the answers to questions that still remain, RADIANT has earned itself a spot on my favourites shelf for a long time to come.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Good Idea Turned into a Boring Read</td><td>2.0</td><td>What started as a good idea and certainly landed among the most legendary motorcycling books, I have to say it was extremely hard to read it.

I read the first novel when it initially came out several years ago and then failed to notice the intervening releases. I was pleasantly surprised, when I started reading this one, that missing the in-between novels didn't affect my enjoyment of this book. The \"expendable\" universe is one where humanity has ventured to the stars and promptly found that there are many alien cultures out there, most of which are far more advanced than man. These cultures have a rule against killing sentient life. If you do it, and then try to leave your solar system, you are zapped as a \" dangerous non-sentient\". Humanity splits into two cultures, the Technocracy and the Unity, one averse to tinkering with genes and the other gung-ho about it. Nicely though, unlike most of our history, these two cultures don't fight each other....since doing so would get them all erased as non-sentients....they just kind of bicker like a divorced couple. In this novel, Ugly Screaming Stink-Baby, otherwise known as Youn Sue, is a 19 year old cadre of the Explorers, an arm of the Technocracy Navy. the Explorers are scouts that are sent ahead of the regular Navy to explore new worlds, and to determine all the myriad things that can kill people on them. Think of the expendable ensigns on the old Star Trek shows and you'll get the idea. Actually, that probably is where Gardner got the idea. Naturally the mortality rate within this elite group is high; so the technocracy response i sto satff the Explorers only with humans that are disfigured. Thse people are considered expendable. In this delightful tale, Youn Sue, a Buddhist, is first infected by a red, spore like sentience that calls itself the Balrog, and which is far smarter than any human. She then is called to rescue a group of Unity Scouts along with the indomitable Admiral Ramos and another explorer, Tut. The Unity scouts, although dispersed around the planet, all disappeared at once and the Explorer's are the closest group when the mayday comes in. They must solve the puzzle of the missing scouts and determine why the Balrog attacked Youn Sue, while fending off velociraptors on an archaelogical mystery planet.

You decide.  Did the author's father really kill the Black Dahlia and a number of other women in the Los Angles area, and was his guilt covered up by the Los Angeles Police Department?  These are all murder cases around 1950 that remain unsolved to this day. But author Hodel, a former LAPD member himself, believes he has solved the case...and the killer is his father!  No spoiler with that statement, it's in the liner notes.  After his retirement from the force, Hodel turns his attention to the Black Dahlia case and several others of that time period.  And although he and several others become convinced that the dad did it, I'm not so sure.  The first two thirds of this big book lays out the hundreds of investigative finds that Hodel believes prove his case.  I don't agree.  The evidence he presents seems mostly circumstantial to me and based on wild supposition and coincidences that stretch the imagination.  In fact, I find only one piece of indisputable evidence that connects George Hodel to the murder: a handwriting expert's analysis that determines that GH wrote the many notes after the murder that teased the press and police.  But, still again, it doesn't prove that he murdered the BD.  In the last third of the book -- added after the initial publication which found many nay-sayers, Steve Hodel organizes his proof, adds further information -- mostly from interviews, and tries to make a stronger case for his assertions. But as a member of the jury, I still find many doubts, not just shadows.  And why would the son do this to his father?  Simple.  Revenge. The dad did desert the son and his family when the boy was in his youth.  The dad did commit incest with the son's sister.  The dad did marry a woman, unknown to the son, and the son later married the same woman.  Plenty of reasons to hate the old man.  And there is one strong contradictory statement.  Early in the book, the son says his dad was totally against abortions. But later on, he connects him to an abortion ring.  So, fellow citizens, read it for yourself and decide for yourself.

The big throw-off, for me, at first, was that Hodel bases his whole premise on the discovery of two photographs found in his father's collection which he ( the author) claims are Elizabeth Short. They are not, and better qualified people than me have concluded this too ( James Ellroy, for a start). The photos are not even of the same person, and one looks a little like Gloria Vanderbilt, the other like a coarse version of Rita Hayworth. Okay, that said, we move on, and it becomes fascinating. I learned so much about the era, the sexual corruption of the times, the corruption in the LAPD, the social mores, it's great for that alone. Hodel posits that his father killed Elizabeth Short and he presents his case extremely convincingly. Even though it gets a bit bogged down in spots ( the handwriting analyses, for one), it's un-put-downable and has set me on the quest, next timeI'm in LA, to see the \"Franklin\" house, as he calls it, where he lived as a child and where his father held a lot of sinister gatherings.

If author and former LA cop Steve Hodel's father really did kill Elizabeth Short (`The Black Dahlia'), the discerning reader certainly won't be convinced of it by this book. In laying out his case, Hodel starts with a monumentally flawed premise, then spirals into a chasm of conjecture and supposition which we're expected to accept as evidence. Hardly what one would expect from a retired homicide detective. And that flawed premise? Well, Hodel believes that a pair of pictures in his father's old photo album are of Elizabeth Short herself. The problem, as so many readers and critics have pointed out, is that they just don't look much like Short. Hell, the women in the two pictures don't even look much like each other! But as badly as it starts, Hodel's case against his father goes nowhere but downhill from there.  Rather than solid evidence, the author conjures wild theories that - perhaps in his mind alone - tie his father to Short's murder. Somehow, for Steve Hodel, his father's friendship with eccentric artist Man Ray adds up to a clue. Somehow a photo by Man Ray of Dr. George Hodel posed beside a bronze sculpture of an ancient god adds up to evidence that Daddy was a murderer. Or there's Hodel's assertion that Short's body was posed where it was found, arms above head to resemble - ready kids? - a famous Man Ray photo. (Isn't this how her arms might naturally have fallen, especially if her killer dragged or carried her by her wrists when he left her?) And, in a glaring inconsistency, Hodel reports that authorities were afraid to go after his father for the Short murder for fear of being exposed in scandal (as a VD clinic doc, Doctor Hodel supposedly had the goods on various local officials), but had no problem at all charging him with molesting his daughter in a high profile case just a couple of years later. There are other big inconsistencies and questions left dangling in Steve Hodel's book, too. Early on, he's stunned to find a picture of his former wife in the same photo album in which his late father carried the alleged Dahlia photos. But he'd learned YEARS earlier that his father had been in love with this woman. (Of course, he had been stunned then, too.) So why was it such a shocker to find her picture among his late father's belongings? Elsewhere, Hodel claims that he didn't find out his father had been on a list of Dahlia suspects until well after his father's death. But considering that one of the younger Hodel's partners in the LAPD had been assigned to the Dahlia case for a time, well, is this entirely believable? Whether or not Steve Hodel believes his own story, of course, is open to speculation. But despite the flimsy `clues' he gathers against his father, the author gives us ample evidence regarding the deep hatred he feels for his dad. There's his father's absence and eventual abandonment of his family. The alleged abuse of the author's sister at the hands of Dr. Hodel. The relationship between Dr. Hodel and Steve Hodel's first wife. Given the sheer volume of parental misdeeds reported here, Hodel isn't especially convincing when he writes of having a certain affection for his father later in life. Thus, the likelihood that this book is mere posthumous revenge seems fairly high. Perhaps some of this could be forgiven if Steve Hodel could at least make it all more compelling. As it sits, \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" is a meandering mess of a book packed to the gills with confusing side stories, digression and truly awful prose. Consider Hodel's description of his moment of (incorrect) recognition that the pictures in daddy's photo album are Elizabeth Short: \"It was she. The Dahlia. The Black Dahlia.\" It's bad romance novel-level writing at its finest. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is nowhere near that hilarious.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Dahlia Avenger</td><td>3.0</td><td>I was turned off, I believe, by the 2nd page, where the author refers to himself as a real-life hero, and name dropping (John Huston--even Lash Larue, for crying out loud).

As someone whose primary interest in true crime is the Ripper case and the Maybrick Diary, I now have an even better understanding of why it's difficult to put old mysteries to rest with late-discovered evidence, no matter how solid it is.  People like mysteries too much to want them put to rest, and they'll even turn ugly when denied their fix. Be that as it may, Steve Hodel has certainly found the proverbial \"smoking gun\" linking his late father, George Hodel, not only to the murder of the \"Black Dahlia\" but to a number of serial killings in the Los Angeles area in the late 1940's.  He found several smoking guns to that effect - and to the effect that the cover-up of George Hodel's involvement stemmed from the highest reaches of the LAPD, including two former police chiefs.  I'm amazed that anyone would claim otherwise. People who would argue otherwise are simply misrepresenting.  The photographs that Hodel found in his father's photo album are certainly those of the Black Dahlia, Betty Short. What's more the poses in which she is engaged in both the George Hodel photos AND as a result of the staging of her corpse as it is found on the crime scene bear more than a superficial resemblance to the photography and artwork of Man Ray, regardless of what anyone else says. And it's sheer disingenuousness to say that his case against his late father is based solely on those photos.  In addition to the handwriting expert that he found linking his father's handwriting to that of the notes, there are a thousand other clues which the gainsayers would ignore, but if I were to go too deeply into them, there would be no need for anyone to buy the book. Even assuming for the sake of argument that some of this evidence could be defended away, what are the odds against Steve Hodel coming to the conclusion that his father was the Black Dahlia killer INDEPENDENTLY of similar conclusions found in old LAPD/District Attorney files - if indeed this was not the case? How is it that Steve Hodel is able to convince the lead district attorney of Los Angeles County that he has solved the Black Dahlia mystery - and yet a few recalcitrant critics remain unconvinced? There are some questions that Hodel left unanswered that I would have liked elucidation on.  Among other things, he implicates none other than renowned actor/director John Huston (who died in 1987) as a friend of his father's and a co-participant in various acts of sexual deviance.  Is there any reason to implicate Huston as actually having participated somehow in the murders or having obtained guilty knowledge before or after the fact?  Hodel doesn't tell us. Admittedly, it's difficult to maintain one's professional objectivity when working on a personal matter, and if this were an ONGOING criminal investigation in which his father was involved, Hodel simply would not be allowed to remain on the case.  With all of the goodwill and professional judgment in the world, he could not be expected to remain objective. Yet the dryness of Hodel's tone as he is engaging in the criminal investigation - a dryness that sometimes detracts from the book's readability - suggests that he was able to maintain enough objectivity to proceed and certainly the evidence that he produces seems irrefutable to reasonable people. Hodel's own relationship with his father when he was alive was a checkered one - his bitterness towards him for abandoning his mother vanishes in later years when he meets his father again and they begin the long slow process of reconciliation.  How was Hodel personally affected by his professional conclusion that his father was, in fact, a sadistic serial killer?  He tells us his reaction to this conclusion, but I think that he stops just short of saying all that is in his heart. While some - maybe the same people who yet shriek \"fake\" when confronted with the Maybrick Diary - insist that the case against George Hodel has still not been proven and continue to take comfort from the placebo that is the \"still unsolved mystery\", others will recognize that Hodel's placing of a name and a face to the image of Elizabeth Short's killer actually deepens the mystery - the mystery of the human heart. How could a highly-educated man capable of the poetic depth that George Hodel was capable of demonstrating on the surface be equally capable of such depraved crimes?  His son gives us glimpses of an early incident in his father's life that might have been the spark - but even at that, it hardly seems sufficient to explain so many possible murders, as well as the brutality of the Elizabeth Short murder - which involved prolonged torture before death. And I, as I am sure many readers were, was struck with the horrible dichotomy of the extent and atrociousness of the murders - the Black Dahlia murder in particular - and their perpetrator dying peacefully of natural causes at the age of 92.  It leaves me uncertain whether this COMPATIBLE OR INCOMPATIBLE with the notion of God's justice.  That George Hodel could have escaped retribution on earth challenges the notion that the universe ever evolved from Chaos, but equally inconceivable would be the absence of divine retribution for these crimes. These are questions that his son does not even attempt to answer for us.  He is a retired cop and not a theologian, and anyway it is surely at this point where his objectivity must falter.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Some Memories are Best Left in the Past</td><td>2.0</td><td>Imagining that I must have read this book when it was first published, I thought I give it another read now that I am in my 60's.

And I never was! I really can't add much to the plot description, only that I found the last few lines on the novel being a very nice touch.  The novel reads easily, the action, the events, the intrigue flows effortlessly.  There is humor found almost everywhere.  There are also \"Star Wars\" artifacts lurking on pages and knowing what a big fan Suzanne is, I thought that she might have written a contemporary title just for the fun of being able to mention \"Star Wars\" in there. The romantic scenes are also done with much more \"freedom\" than those in historical titles.  And there is much more humor and fun in them too. After reading this book, I can't now decide which I like more:  Suzanne's historical titles or her contemporary one.  I am very hopeful that she will not stop at just one contemporary novel, but I am also looking forward to her next historical one too.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Successful Transition from Historical</td><td>4.0</td><td>Enoch's first contemporary novel is fresh, sexy and witty; having read all her historicals I was wary of how she would translate into the 21st century, but Flirting was probably her best novel to date. Sam Jellicoe is a premier cat burglar who's attempt to relieve British billionaire Rick Addison of an ancient collectible goes awry when a bomb kills a security guard during the job.  Sam rescues Rick from the explosion (a nice switch) and, now a murder suspect, leverages his gratitude and her black market connections to persuade him to help untangle the mystery. The book was fast-paced, the dialogue was snappy, and the sexual tension between Sam and Rick keeps you nicely distracted from the sometimes-convoluted plot.  At times the suspense was undermined by drawn out conversations about possible suspects and improbable plots as Sam and Rick tried to solve the mystery.  Early hints also left little doubt about the identity and motives of the villain, though the 'how' was elusive enough to keep me interested. However, one of the best things about this book was watching Rick's character change as the story evolves.  Rick was introduced as a bit of prig; judgmental about Sam's nefarious profession even while using her experience to decipher the plot against him--but by the end of the book he was much closer to accepting her past.  What made this transformation unique was Enoch's decision to avoid the usual whitewash, i.e., she was a thief because she had an abusive childhood or was valiantly supporting a younger sibling with her life of crime, etc. The book also appears to be the first in a series, reminiscent of JD Robb/Nora Robert's Naked in Death; though less gritty and more focused on romance than suspense.  The characters also echo Naked, though here the criminal tendencies are on the female side, the male lead's charming accent is British, and the tone is much more light-hearted. I very much enjoyed the book overall and look forward to reading the next in the series.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>RIDICULOUS!!!!</td><td>1.0</td><td>I don't know where to begin with this book.  The author's main contention is that his father, George Hill Hodel,  was the black dahlia killer.  His two main pieces of evidence are photo's of Elizabeth Short that he supposedly found in his father's photo album after his father's death, and notes that match his father's handwriting that the killer mailed to newspapers and police after the dahlia death. The photo's he found that he claims are Elizabeth Short are clearly not her, her chin and bridge of her nose completely different. The author doesn't go to any facial recognition experts or use computer software to prove his claim that the photo's found his father's album are elizabeth short.  He spends two sentences on that subject saying he thinks they are the same.  CBS 48 hours mystery recently exposed this issue, hiring a forensic artist, who using software determined with 85% probability it is not her. His second piece of evidence is the handwriting of his father and the notes the killer supposedly wrote to the newspapers and police. Assuming the notes are even written by the killer and not mailed in by a hoaxer, the author submits one handwriting expert stating it is the same handwriting.  48 hour mystery hired two handwriting experts, both concluding they are not of the same handwriting. I can imagine how many handwriting experts the author must to went too before he found one that agreed with him. You would think with 500 pages of material he would have more than two pieces of evidence against the suspect but no he does not. The rest of book is biography hybrid of Father and the rest of his family which has absolutely nothing to do with the black dahlia. Lastly, you can clearly see the author is completely conflicted about his father.  He hates him, for good reason, because his father beat him, molested and raped his sister, abandoned him to his alcoholic mother, and apparently had an affair with author's first wife.  But as you read the book, you can see he has admiration for his father, his intellect, often referring to him affectionately. While his father I have no doubt was a bad man, the Black Dahlia killer he was not. The author is clearly a good writer and perhaps he should try crime fiction entirely.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Pure Conjecture/No Proof</td><td>3.0</td><td>Hodel may be correct in his assumptions that his father is a murderer but he clearly hasn't established this. The pictures of the women he purports to be Beth Short neither resemble her nor each other. One looks like a cute teenager and the other like a much older woman. Neither conjure an image of Short. While Hodel Junior sees his father as suave and sophisticated, he looks weak-chinned and ordinary, nothing of the charismatic lothario he's depicted as. That he had abundant drugs and money suggests he hosted some wild parties and knew some interesting figures of the times but nothing more. While it's nice to see that Hodel's superiors think his theory has merit, they should pursue the investigation. The evidence remaining from the unsolved murders can be tested in light of this evidence. Hodel Senior's peers and their children can be interviewed, and his trail to Manila should be pursued. If he's truly the mad murderer Steve Hodel has us believe, the trail shouldn't stop cold. If he's truly the detective he claims to be he should pursue this and offer solid proof not conjecture based on memories of a less than perfect father.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>There comes a point....</td><td>1.0</td><td>When a guy like Ranger....grows some balls and stops protecting her...when she's clearly with someone else....

Replete with photographs, handwriting analysis, \"thoughtprints\" as Hodel terms an experienced, successful investigator's impressions and intuition, and a chronology of the events of the Black Dahlia case, this book is hard to put down.  You will stay awake reading.  Hodel's conclusion that his father and another man were serial killers of attractive, vulnerable women, will chill you. Unlike some others who wrote about the Black Dahlia, Hodel views her with a sympathetic eye, feeling that she was a young woman who wanted what most do---a loving husband, a home, children. Adrift in post-WWII era Los Angeles, she encountered instead George Hodel, and met a violent end at a young age. Hodel is to be commended for his long, meticulous search for the facts, for his own hunches on how to put the facts together, and for his brutal honesty as it became increasingly clear in his own mind, that his father had been responsible for the death of the Dahlia and probably for many other murders.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>This Book is a Treasure!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I'm just astounded by most of the other reviews I saw on here.  Are they all members of a conspiracy to bring down Yoko Ono?  I would NOT like to meet any of those people in person. This is one of the best books I've ever read.  I'm 3/4's of the way done with it, and it has changed me.  I cried my eyes out, I laughed, and I learned so much about John and even about life.  Not every entry is spectacular, but many of them are, including Julie Gold's, which moved me and my husband to tears.  (Someone criticized her in another review.)  I suppose if you're a complete cynic and are convinced that Yoko is the devil, you'll be too prejudiced to see what this book really has to offer, which is this:  As much as I thought I already knew and understood John and Yoko, I now REALLY understand, as if I'd spent a week with them.  John was an outstanding person and artist with no ego.  Yoko is an artist with an out-of-this-world whimsical and spiritual viewpoint, and out of the hundreds of women he met, he chose her to be his woman and his teacher.  He was not controlled by her.  If you think Lennon could be controlled by ANYONE, you don't know the first thing about him.  He was his own man more than just about anyone, and he chose and cherished her.  They have a connection way beyond this life, and it is this book which FINALLY explains it, if you read it with an open heart.  It has honestly changed my life, and I feel dreadfully sorry for those too solid (as in not light and free) and jaded to be able to experience something as pure and truthful and honest and beautiful as this jewel.  I thank Yoko from the bottom of my heart. By the way, I'm no goody-goody.  I can confront evil, and I know bad literature when I read it.  This is goodness and brilliance.  Elliott Mintz's essay, for one, is pure gold.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>What A Waste</td><td>1.0</td><td>Don't waste your money-this is the least interesting book I have ever read. The essays are so badly written and many are so self-serving it is offensive (who is that half-wit Julie Gold?). I'm not sure how it's possible to make a boring book about John Lennon but this one succeeds.  Too bad, it could have been great.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Memories of JohnandYoko</td><td>2.0</td><td>I bought this book with happy anticipation.  It seemed like a good idea:  a collection of essays by different people, remembering John, published 25 years after his untimely death. I had seen a similar collection of statements many years ago, soon after John died, and that one was moving.  But I overlooked one important thing:  this book was edited by Yoko Ono.   Why the 2 star rating?  The book itself is good quality and has a few nice pictures. And some of the essays are nice such as the ones by Mick Jagger and Elliot Mintz. However too much of the material is of poor quality for different reasons.   The book smacks of one of Yoko's popularist art projects.  It appears as if she invited a bunch of people, some who never met John and who probably know little about him, to send in an essay so they can get their name in print.  An essay by Alicia Keyes is nice, but she didn't know the man. How could she have a memory of John?  As a result, several essays repeat the same unimaginative theme:  we liked John because he wrote Imagine.  We never met him but we like the song because he sang about brotherhood and peace.   Other essays are so short as to be meaningless.  Some contributors sent in amateur drawings or poetry.  This may be fine for an elementary school project where a teacher tells her 7 year old students \"write a poem or do a drawing about John Lennon\" but, to me, this is not worthy of a hardcovered book obstensibly published to honor John Lennon.   Another problem with this book is the same problem mentioned by critics of the Lennon Broadway show:  the Yoko-fication of the Lennon legacy.  While many of the essays address John alone or John as a Beatle, I could not help but notice that many of the essays not only discuss John, but practically deify Yoko.  We learn from these essays that Yoko was the love of John's life; that she was a talented artist; that her genius wasn't appreciated years ago, but that Yoko was 30 years ahead of her time; that people did not appreciate Yoko because she married a Beatle; that Yoko did NOT break up the Beatles; that Yoko had a tremendous positive influence on John, etc. Did I mention that Yoko was the editor, and thus had a say in which essays were chosen for publication and which were not?  It seems obvious that the \"deification of Yoko\" was a factor in choosing certain essays.   While I enjoyed the contribution by Elliot Mintz, he goes into great detail about The Lost Weekend, and mentions different people John saw and places John visited.  But not one mention of May Pang.  No, just like in the Lennon Broadway show, May does not and did not exist.  Did I mention that Yoko was the editor of this book?   Many different people made contributions to this book, but oddly there is no memory of John essay by Julian, Sean or Yoko herself.  One would like to think that John's second wife and sons would have something special to say for this 25th anniversary offering.  Not one word.   And just in case you've forgotten who the brilliant editor was of this masterpiece, Yoko is mentioned on the front cover, the back flap, wrote an introduction, and has a full paragraph in the back of the book describing her \"accomplishments\" as a musician and artist.   My suggestion?  If you are a fan of Yoko Ono, you will appreciate this book.  If you are a Lennon or Beatle fan, you may wish to take it out of your public libary or buy a second hand copy at a discount, but otherwise, skip it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A deserved best-seller - fabulous, meticulous, a winner.</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am astounded by two things associated with Steve Hodel's \"Black Dahlia Avenger.\" * This is NOT just about the Black Dahlia murder. This is an absorbing and painstaking reconstruction of events associated with the murder of Elizabeth Short, as well as about a dozen other sex-related (and to date unsolved) murders of women across several years in Los Angeles. * There is an amazing volume of mean-spirited venom about this book that, in my view, feels disproportionately harsh, given what author Hodel, a former homicide detective who has investigated more than 300 murders in the Los Angeles area, has accomplished. Hodel is not an amateur sleuth. His credentials are solid. What's best about \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" is until the very end, Hodel maintains an eerily professional sense of detachment about everything he uncovers. There are no sensationalistic pronouncements (or even sensationalistic photos) - and whenever he launches into something unproven, he tells the reader up front what must remain in the realm of \"speculation\" - while expressing an opinion that feels like common sense. Hodel writes and acts like the former homicide detective he is; and only at the end does he allow the reader a window into his emotions. Yet this is an engrossing read, accessible to all. It reads and tracks better than a fictional whodunit. \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" is simply one of the finest true-crime books ever written. Author Hodel is so exhaustive in his research, he even devotes an entire chapter to what five decades of \"mythology\" associated with the Black Dahlia have done to taint our view about the crime and the victim herself. Hodel explores everything: the possible nature of Elizabeth Short's relationship with his father, police corruption and payoffs, the motives behind covering up or destroying evidence, the significance of an illegal abortion ring and its relationship to the LAPD, the relationship between the police and the press, the circle of \"friends\" the murderer and his accomplice had, their obsession with surrealism, sexual submission, etc. - an eerily timed incest trial involving his father and half-sister, an oddly coincidental 40 years worth of self-imposed \"exile\" by his father that in retrospect appears related to fears linked to the Dahlia - the list goes on and on. Yet best of all, Hodel does the most prudent thing any detective would do before going public. Beyond conducting an exhaustive number of interviews, he obtains \"blind\" handwriting analyses from a forensics expert, and to further convince himself and the reader that he's on the right track, he submits all of his data, as in a real murder investigation, to a surprised and perhaps initially skeptical deputy district attorney, Mr. Steve Kay in Los Angeles. Deputy D.A. Kay, while qualifying his opinion as being his own, declares that based on evidence gathered, author Steve Hodel is correct; his father George was the prime suspect in Elizabeth Short's murder, and if alive, he would be prosecuted for this as well as for the murder of Jeanne French, which occurred a month later. The negative reviews are so shrill and insultingly dismissive that they go beyond trying to diminish author Hodel's accomplishments (e.g., calling it a \"Daddy Dearest\" screed; I assure you this book is not). They feel like an attempt to trash Hodel, to convince you his book shouldn't be explored at all, that it doesn't belong on ANY bookshelf. Maybe some of it isn't rock solid, but Hodel is up front about what is and what isn't, and is beyond careful, using qualifers to help the reader along. Some of the venom is focused on the author's discovery of two mysterious photos in his father's personal album that resemble Elizabeth Short. Some claim the woman doesn't look like the Black Dahlia at all. Well, one only needs to look at other photos of Elizabeth Short, and not just the few that appear in the book, to be convinced there is indeed a resemblance. Common sense dictates that absent a resemblance, Hodel's investigation AND his book would not have reached first base, let alone all the way to acquiring a favorable opinion from deputy D.A. Steve Kay. Perhaps in a later edition, author Hodel should include other photos of the victim, combined with opinions of renowned medical examiners, as part of his response to skeptics.  However, the photos were merely a launching point for Hodel's curiosity.  By the end of the book, the evidence gathered makes those photos superfluous.  His investigation in no way rises or falls on just two photos. After many decades of reading Dahlia books, I'm finally convinced that author Hodel has come closest to presenting the best and most plausible explanation of what happened, backed by voluminous research and exhibits. Give it a chance and read it from cover-to-cover. Trust me, this one is a winner.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>General skepticism, but still. . .</td><td>3.0</td><td>Based solely on the evidence presented in BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER, it's hard to believe that author Steve Hodel's father, Dr. George Hodel, killed Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia.  For one thing, the younger Hodel makes a number of assertions that undermine his credibility b/c they are obviously untrue.  The most important is that the young woman in two photos he found in his father's album is Elizabeth Short.  Clearly, she isn't.  (To see for yourself, compare these photos with the pictures in other books on the murder, for example John Gilmore's SEVERED.)  In addition to this obvious untruth, Hodel makes assertions he can't back up.  On pp 427-431, for example, he insists that his father and Elizabeth Short conducted an affair during 1944-1945, that the doctor wined and dined her at the finest restaurants, that he proposed marriage, that perhaps he assaulted her.  Nowhere in any of BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER'S 462 pages does he adduce evidence to support any of these claims.  It all makes a reader skeptical. Hodel also asserts that his father \"displayed\" the Black Dahlia's body in a pose taken from a photograph by his friend, Man Ray.  Well, maybe.  But in another book on the case, Mary Pacios uses an artfully-mangled mannequin from the set of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI to \"prove\" that director Orson Welles was the murderer.  And James Ellroy's novel speculates that Elizabeth Short's gashed cheeks made her resemble a character from Alexander Dumas' THE MAN WHO LAUGHS.  It seems that wherever you go in the Black Dahlia case, there's an artistic reference--but no way to tell which is valid, which isn't.  Besides, why should the posing point to Dr. Hodel?  Why not to Man Ray himself? Hodel's strongest evidence is handwriting, but even that doesn't link his father to Elizabeth Short, except glancingly.  The direct connection is to the \"Red Lipstick\" murder of Jeanne French three weeks after that of the Black Dahlia.  Clearly, the French murder could be the work of a copycat, but that's a possibility Hodel never explores.  A skeptical reader has to think maybe it's because the Black Dahlia crime is more famous, hence more likely to sell copies of the book. On the other hand. . .  since BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER was published, both NEWSWEEK and 60 MINUTES have learned that Dr. Hodel was indeed considered a Black Dahlia suspect by the L.A. district attorney in 1949.  His house was bugged, and the transcript yields some suspicious remarks.  But NEWSWEEK also reports more than 20 other suspects, and that the mass of the transcript tends to exculpate Dr. Hodel.  I'd love to hear the evidence that aroused the grand jury's suspicions, just as I'd love to have the Black Dahlia case solved after all these years. Difficult to believe as it is, Hodel's book may contain some grains of truth.  It's just that we need more than it provides--a lot more.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Recently released evidence supports author's claims</td><td>4.0</td><td>Quoting from AP reporter Linda Deutsch's review of this book as published in Denver's Rocky Mountain News on April 15, 2003: \"When District Attorney Steven Cooley decided recently to release the long-secret files on the [Black Dahlia] case, Steve Hodel's theory gained substance.  His father's photograph was in the file, along with transcripts of electronic surveillance on his home for three weeks in 1950. The reports on onionskin paper that is yellowed make clear that Dr. Hodel was a prime suspect in the investigation of Short's murder. . . . The transcripts of overheard conversations include a statement in Hodel's voice saying, 'Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia.  They couldn't prove it now.  They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead.'\" This may not be conclusive (and may well be to obscure for anyone who has not read the book) but it does prove that Dr. Hodel was the wealthy and influential Hollywood resident referred to by the grand jury and it proves that the LAPD or the DA's investigators zeroed in on Dr. Hodel without benefit of the two pictures that may or may not be Short that began the author's investigation. I, of course, do not know whether the author's theory is wrong or right.  I found this book to be highly entertaining and I think that it may have lit a fuse that may solve the case once and for all.  At the very least, it has caused previously secret files to be released.  I see a film all right, but not an Oliver Stone film, this should be a film by somebody who cares whether a story is true or false.

Both content and style are immensely impressive. Consider the following passage: \"We have few words left in which to accept our Cross from God. We are poorer than Job. Like him we are tempted to curse the day we came into existence because our whole life is full of evil. But we do not have his eloquence. When we talk to ourselves we have even less to say than Job's friends. We have nothing. We may spiritually share the utter degradation of the Jews who, reduced to skeletons, walked to their death in the furnaces of Auschwitz... But it is licit to pray to God to be spared such extremes. We are poor enough as it is, and our poverty includes a tacit permission to be un-heroic. For this lack of show, this absence of all verve in our sacrifice, is essential to our age. There is no place in our spirituality for anything that inspires wonder, in ourselves or in others. And this is right, because man has lost all wonder for the things of God. He no longer marvels at anything except the prodigies of the Apocolyptic Beast. Hence it is right that our lives, and our prayer, should be empty of all that is wonderful. The supreme mystery is so hidden that it has nothing to show for itself at all, least of all a Gtterdmmerung, a sunset of the gods. Nietzsche speaking of our world, proclaimed that God was dead. And that is why, in our contemplation, God must often seem to be absent, as though dead. But the truth of our contemplation is this: that never more than today has He made His presence felt by 'being absent.' In this, then, we are most faithful: that we prefer the darkness, and in the very depths of our being, value this emptiness and apparent absence. We need not struggle vainly to make Him present, if such struggles are a mockery. Leave nothingness as it is. In it, He is present.\" (p. 121-122) I had a copy of this book when it was only available as an off-print, which came as a set of eight thin booklets. It's nice to have it in the form of a single book. If you are a Merton fan, you simply must have this book in your personal library. If you've never read anything by Merton, this book would be a great introduction to his works.</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 763 rows.</div>"

         "The old saying that \"no good deed goes unpunished\" is proven once again in Laura Lippman's new Tess Monaghan novel.  Tess is a Baltimore-based private investigator and former reporter who lives in harmony with her boyfriend, Edgar \"Crow\" Ransome, until Crow unexpectedly brings home a troubled teenager named Lloyd Jupiter.  Crow is a soft touch and a do-gooder, and even after Lloyd perpetrates a scam on Crow, the kindhearted man decides to give the hungry and homeless boy a decent meal and a roof over his head.  Tess is less than thrilled with this arrangement, and she is even more ticked off when Lloyd leaves in the middle of the night, planning to steal her laptop, digital camera, Lexus SUV, and other assorted items.  Although Lloyd's scheme doesn't play out exactly as planned, he manages to get away and promptly disappears into the streets of Baltimore. As it turns out, Lloyd may possess key information about the unsolved murder of Gregory Youssef, an Assistant United States Attorney who disappeared and was later found dead after having been stabbed dozens of times.  Since he had been assigned to antiterrorism cases and had also prosecuted drug cases, the authorities assumed that Youssef must have been kidnapped and killed by one of the many enemies he made as a prosecutor.  However, the murder remains unsolved and soon fades from the headlines.  Later, rumors began to surface that Youssef may have been involved in a gay love tryst gone bad.  This does not sit well with Youssef's wife, who rejects the idea as absurd.  However, on the night that Lloyd stays in her home, Tess notices that when Youssef's name comes up in passing, the young man apparently recognizes it and appears very frightened and guilt-ridden. \"No Good Deeds\" is a well-crafted story that seamlessly combines a number of themes:  the plight of homeless and neglected children, the corrosive nature of police corruption, and the manner in which secrets and lies destroy relationships and lives.  The characters are varied, lively, and well delineated.  They include Gabe Delasio, a shallow and ambitious Assistant United States Attorney who desperately wants to climb through the ranks, Barry Jenkins, a washed up FBI agent, and Mike \"Bully\" Collins, a tough-as-nails African-American DEA agent who is bitter about having been hung out to dry after he shot a civilian during a drug bust.  Each of these men has his own agenda, and when all three join forces to nail Tess and Crow, the two wind up in grave danger. As always, Monaghan brings her native Baltimore to life, with its beauty and ugliness as well as its tranquility and violence, and there are also evocative and atmospheric scenes at the Delaware shore. Lippman's descriptive writing and dialogue are as sharp as ever, and she skillfully integrates the many disparate elements of her intricate plot into a satisfying whole.  Lippman does what few suspense writers have the ability to accomplish.  She creates intriguing scenarios with recognizable people whose back stories make their behavior, if not commendable, at least understandable.  The best mysteries are never formulaic whodunits, but fully realized novels, and \"No Good Deeds\" continues the fine Lippman tradition of respecting her audience's intelligence enough to avoid predictable and hackneyed writing in favor of complex and riveting storytelling.",

         "Don't normally write book reviews but the existing reviews were so far off base, I couldn't stay silent. First of all the book painfully shows its age being written in 1986 when all the business \"gurus\" were touting the success of McDonalds, Coke and IBM as their own.  These references were outdated even then.  I thought that \"revisited\" (1995 publish date) might include a reference to the internet at least, but I was wrong. The book feels like a 268 page infomercial for the author's consulting company.  Once per chapter you can count on:  \"we at GERBER Corp\" have the answer to this problem. We'll give an overgeneralized and useless thumbnail of the solution here, in the hopes that you might become a client\" I appreciate the attempt at allegorical style, but it is poorly done.  I don't believe for a minute that there ever was a conversation with a \"Sarah\" that runs through the book.  With this obvious falsification, the author loses authenticity. Obviously the author is a career consultant and it is painfully obvious: for example the points he makes are always bunched in threes. (because thats the only way stupid people comprehend at hotel seminars)  Well what if the discoveries take you in a direction that leads to 5 or 13 points of knowledge? There is no hard data, empirical evidence, test results, or original knowledge - just anecdotes and the author's unsupported claims, likely culled from a morass of 1970s business books and spun into a different yarn. Despite all this, there are some interesting points raised about the qualities needed for starting a business being different from those to run it.  Some colorful descriptions here and there which elevate it to two stars bordering on three. In summary: If you want to grow a business larger than a mom and pop and stay profitable over time, you must build systems and processes.  The author thinks a lot of small business owners don't know this.  If you do know this, move on.",

         "I heard colleagues recommend \"The E-Myth Revisited\" time and time again",
         5,
         "When I ran a small photography business, I heard colleagues recommend \"The E-Myth Revisited\" time and time again. Yet, years went by, I closed my business due to low revenue, and still, I had not read the book. Until this past week, when I remembered that the book was collecting dust under my bed. I got down on my hands and knees to fish it out and give it a read. I could not put it down. This book has forever changed how I view business, whether it's a small one-person shop or a large Fortune 500 corporation. My favorite concept in the book is the idea of building a prototype. Imagine you are looking to franchise your business. You need to create the structure and systems so that anyone could buy the franchise and successfully run the business. Create an organization chart with the various positions that are necessary for your business to run (e.g. CEO, CFO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, etc.). Each of those positions needs defined responsibilities and expectations as well as an Operating Manual so that anyone could jump into that position and be successful. \"But wait,\" you say. \"I'm the only person who works in my business. This won't help me.\" Yes, it will. Instead of arriving at work and just \"getting to work,\" having distinct positions can help you be intentional about your time. Instead of running around haggard only to feel like you got nothing done at the end of the day, you will intentionally put on the appropriate \"hat\" and work on a specific goal before moving on. Why did my photography business close up shop? Because I never wore my marketing hat and would only wear my CFO hat when I scrambled to find documents for taxes. I never wore my CEO hat and took the time to strategically plan the trajectory of my business. The only hat I wore was that of a photographer, assuming that if my pictures were good enough, they would sell themselves. So I spent all of my time and money focused on that vague goal. I worked 50-60 hours every week, often with nothing to show by the end of the week. As Zig Ziglar said, If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time. Having defined roles in a one-person business aids with focus. As you hire people, they can step into these defined roles to lighten your load. With clearly stated goals, responsibilities and expectations, you are giving a new employee the tools to succeed. This concept applies to any type of organization, even at a volunteer level. I've been thinking about setting up a playgroup for my son to get some play time and for me to network with other parents and make friends. My first thought was to run head first and immediately schedule events. But after reading \"The E-Myth,\" I've realized I should first create defined positions, even if I serve in every position at the beginning. It gives other parents the opportunity to step up and host activities that suit their interests. By having set positions and defined expectations for each position, the group can grow to a point of having several events per week without me feeling frazzled and overbooked. I would recommend this book to anyone who leads a business or organization. Seriously. No need for years to pass and you to go out of business before reading it. :) It could completely shatter and rebuild how you define and operate a business.",

         "Lord Ingrey kin Wolfcliff knows about animal possession. Still, when he arrives at the deathscene of a prince, he is shocked to find the accused killer to be a beautiful woman--who happens to be possessed by a leopard. It's his duty to bring Lady Ijada to the capital where, perhaps, she can find justice. But some compulsion, almost impossible to resist, is urging him to kill her at once. A very different compulsion draws him to her. In a meeting with a priestess, the wolf that dwells within Ingrey becomes active--opening his eyes to the magic that is around him and hinting at one of the ancient heresies--that animal-ridden people have a special path to the deities. But Ingrey and Ijada are not the only people with the forbidden animal inhabitation. Ingrey's cousin, Earl Horseriver, seems inhabited by a stalion--and something more. Whether that something more is good or evil, Ingrey has a hard time determining. Author Lois McMaster Bujold combines fascinating world-building, intriguing and multi-dimensional characters, and plenty of magic and action to deliver a truly superior fantasy. Bujold explains the history of the tortured land, and then weaves that history into the present, and into the task that Ingrey and Ijada must fulfil. THE HALLOWED HUNT is set in the same world as Bujold's earlier (and excellent) CURSE OF CHALION and PALADIN OF SOULS. Although I enjoyed the earlier books, I think HUNT surpasses even those.",

In his mind, he travels through time, inventing an alter life in wihich he escapes from Earth, but perhaps the novel's most clear theme is the innescapable nature of war memories. They will even follow you to other worlds. The language can be rough at times, so I can't recommend this book to younger readers, but for adults, it's worth reading and contemplating on why we wage war with one another.

This autobiography chronicles her surgeries, struggles, denial and, finally, acceptance of herself as the mirror of her face.  Facing things might be an apt metaphor here. The metaphor of face, along with her identification of self as she deals with the ravages wrought on her face, are examined from many different vantage points. At first, Ms. Grealy is in denial that she has become different looking.  She then avoids any acknowledgment  of how she's changed post-surgeries. The story shows no self-pity.  Rather, she shares the evolution of her life, family, and growing self-awareness in a chronology of events marked by treatments and surgeries.  This is a beautiful book!!!!",

But don't we all want to see people rise above their negative fates?  To turn it around into a positive?  Yes.

Most memoirs most likely leave certain elements out or elaborate others. In Grealy's case, though, she left behind so many people who really had bad personal experiences with her, that there are a lot of people to dispute or criticize her, as well. That said, even if she was a selfish and spoiled woman, this book is STILL good. It is easy to see, with what she went through, why she became so needy.  At such a young age, her self-image was distorted.  I think anyone who went through that would be the same. I'm reminded, now, of Frances Kuffel's \"Passing for Thin\".  The criticism of that book was similar to this.  She grew up terribly obese, taunted and teased also.  And, she had to relearn things the rest of us take for granted when she grew up.  Grealy learned everything through such negative experiences, also. Lucy Grealy considered herself a poet first, then a memoirist.  Her memoir reads like poetry and the words she chooses to use serve her well. After reading this, I read Ann Patchett's \"Truth and Beauty\" to get a fuller picture of Grealy.  Ann's book talked about many things that Grealy's left out.  Some reviewers seemed to find this troublesome.  I don't think that is the point, however.  Grealy shared with us her thoughts and feelings, not Ann Patchett's.  Sometimes they were contradictory to Patchett's. Sometimes they were contradictory to her own thoughts at different times.

I kept reading in the hopes that things would get better, that someone would finally realize Lucy's worth (perhaps herself) or that one single doctor would come up with a cure-all for her facial disfigurement. However, I was disappointed. Ms. Grealy left a lot of questions unanswered. Her mother \"had\" to leave her job that she had had for many years. Why? Her father died of pancreatitis - how did he develop that? Did he drink? Ms. Grealy admits that she was very detached about her father's death - and so too, it seemed was her twin sister. Was the sister identical? We are not told. Ms. Grealy may discuss things once (such as her relationship to school friends after her operation), then never mention these friends again. She states that her brother later developed schizophrenia, but doesn't talk about him, or any of her family members in any depth. They are not important characters. Basically, this book is all about her feelings about her face and how other people judge her (so she thinks)on her looks. Why does she care what they think? She seems not to worry about packing up and moving anywhere, so she is confident enough for that. She is given a generous scholarship to Sarah Lawrence, although she previously mentioned that she was a \"mediocre\" student. She moves to Iowa, she moves to Germany, she moves to England, she moves to Scotland. She receives many free reconstructive surgeries(or so she says), all the while not working a full-time job, or even a part-time job most of the time. She partied, she had friends. Ms. Grealy does not seem thankful for any of this, she is too busy wallowing in her self-pity.  Ms. Grealy seemed to pick and choose what she wanted the reader to know. I'm now reading Truth and Beauty by Ann Patchett. I'm only on the third chapter, but already know more than this book let on.  Ms. Grealy did suffer through awful surgeries, 2 1/2 years of radiation and chemotherapy (Although Truth and Beauty says 5 years - that would be a bit much), many horrible experiences in the hospital by nurses and butchering doctors who just didn't give a damn, and immature bozos in her school. They should be shot - and where in the world was her twin sister during all of this? Lucy speaks as if she were completely alone in school, so alone that she had to eat her lunch in the counselor's office so that these cruel boys couldn't attack her.  I hate that she felt so badly about herself. But she just couldn't let it go. I wish that Lucy Greely had found a good therapist and increased her self-esteem, taken her focus off her face and decided to concentrate on others who needed her. Her book really leaves me wondering what kind of person she would have been had she not had the disfigurement. I really get the feeling that she wanted others to care about her, but she didn't really care too much for anyone else.  This book could have been fleshed out quite a bit more to explain Lucy's experiences in life.  As it is written, it seems very one-dimensional. The only thing I can say is perhaps this book will be a lesson to us to be grateful for what we have, and to have more compassion and empathy for others and ourselves.",

         1,
         "I have seen Ben Mezrich praised by critics for his wealth of details. He certainly has plenty of details about Japan in Ugly Americans. The problem is: they're all wrong. It starts on the first page, with littered sidewalks, steel-grated doors and broken milk crates, none of which you are ever likely to see in the back streets of Kabuki-cho. It doesn't have sidewalks, or steel-grated doors, or milk crates lying around. I think Mezrich is confusing Tokyo with Manhattan or Boston, where he apparently lives. Every page contains mistakes of some kind. The hero gets a big motorcycle and goes riding. Despite being on a gravel road, he leans over 'almost parallel to the ground,' a manoeuvre which would be fatal for any other rider on the planet. As he rides at 150 kilometers an hour on said gravel road, he experiences 'the acrid smell of burning rubber' and 'cool air mixed with gasoline fumes.' Not only does Mezrich sound as if he's never been to Japan, I also doubt that he's ever been on a motorcycle. You don't get burning rubber just from going fast, and you wouldn't be able to smell either it or the 'gasoline fumes' anyway. The thing about going fast is that you leave everything, including and especially smells, behind you. Mezrich also has the obligatory earthquake, which causes his hero to lift up the window of his new apartment (it would be a horizontally sliding window in Japan) and climb out onto the fire escape (outside fire escapes on apartment buildings in Japan never go past someone's window), etc. And, of course, he has the inevitable appearance of yakuza, the daughter of one of whom falls for our hero. The idea that the proprietor, yakuza or otherwise, of a hostess bar in Roppongi would have his beautiful young daughter working there, dealing with the customers, is ludicrous. And what is the reason for the fascination that non-Japanese have for the yakuza? Do they think some of that hard-man mystique will rub off on themselves if they claim some acquaintance? I don't know anything about the real 'John Malcolm' or the hedge fund business. There are, however, so many details about Japan and Japanese people wrong on every page that I wonder whether anything in the book is accurate. Mezrich should have stuck to writing novels, where 'imagination' is more acceptable.",

         "For a guy who's been dead since 1994, Charles Bukowski is an amazingly prolific sort. This is the 13th posthumous work to come from the Buk since his death and it's subtitled \"new poems.\" The Buk never claimed to be the best person, the best lover, the best writer, the best anything; although I'm sure that at different times and with plenty of beer in him he put forward some extravagant claims of other kinds. I love him, and many, many regular people who feel similarly do so because, I think, he was honest, unsentimental and a great lover of humanity in his poems--even when he is castigating humanity for its ugliness. It's precisely this breadth, which I would call Whitmanesque in its strange multiplicity, that continues to amaze. These are far from his best poems, but there are some gems in here. Bukowski was the kind of poet of which there were and are few to none--a populist who wanted to be left alone, a lonely man who wasn't alone, a craftsman of the finest stamp, somebody who, like Hemingway, got the true words down on paper and knew how to leave it there. There are poems here about the usual Buk concerns: Women, drinking, the track, love, impending death, other writers, fame, bars, working horrible jobs, starving, starving, drinking and writing in boardinghouses; his close and unforgiving (yet deeply sympathetic) portraits of other people trying to push the dharma wheel a few inches forward, usually failing. I won't attempt to do any lit crit pronouncements on this book. It's something to read alone and laugh with, to read openly with other people, to cherish, to keep the fire alive. There's an existential commitment to meaning here, the meaning one places on one's own actions, decisions, follies, joys, tears, life and death.

         "Odd.  What I normally do before reading a book is to sort these Amazon reviews by \"Lowest Rating First\" and see if there's an underlying trend which might indicate an actual bad book.  Doing that here gave me enough of a bad feeling that I worried about the book.  But, since the wife wanted to read it, we got it from the library.  I read it before she could get around to it [g].  Anyway, I was extremely relieved that I found the book to be excellent.  I found myself darn near as engrossed as I did while reading \"Curse of Chalion.\"  Since it included far more of the political-level and more development of the characters than did \"Paladin of Souls\" (and no convenient enemy invasions), I thought is was better than that book.  If I had to stretch to find something bad to say about the book, the worst I could come up with is 1) the antogonist is more cypher than villain and 2) it would have been nice if Bujold had used SOMETHING from the other two books besides the basic premise of the religion.  Other than that, the book is excellent.  I felt it to be nicely paced and, like the others, highly emotionally satisfying.  I rate it at 5 stars out of 5.",

Hallowed Hunt is a completely independent book. You need not read the other entries into the series to appreciate it, although some background gets short shrift. The opening premise is stunning, well-executed, and draws you into the book to see where Bujold is going to go with it. The ending is also pretty darned good, making the book well worth the read. It's the middle that drags. The characters are a bit flat (more dimension than most \"epic fantasy\", but not good enough to carry a couple of hundred pages by themselves). A good bit of the front half of the book is just setting the pieces up and the action is somewhat contained. Nonetheless, this is one of the better fantasies I've read recently and a good step up from most of the over-long junk that lines the shelves of the local megastore.

He served as Chief of Staff throughout the Second World War and then became Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and a Nobel Prize winner. Readers of this book will probably be left wondering how he did it. The authors lose no opportunity  to denigrate and belittle General Marshall. I don't find their reasoning in the least bit convincing. Marshall led the army as the United States in essence fought two world wars simultaneously, defeating two deadly enemies in less than four years. I don't think he accomplished this by dithering, wavering, and routinely making poor decisions.  Marshall ended his career with the warm approbation of some of the finest military and political leaders of his era. - I am reminded of Stimson's remark that George Marshall was the finest soldier he had ever known. The book did have one good effect. I am off to the library today to look for other biographies of General Marshall.. I certainly cannot recommend this one.",

         "Lady Whistledown Strikes Back is for the most part a well written collection of stories.  My main quibble is that the stories were not developed as much as I wanted - but that is to be expected in short stories. The first story, Julia Quinn's, begins at Lady Neely's dinner party where Lady N's ruby bracelete gets stolen.  This is the thread that twines the stories together as all four of the couples are somehow linked to the bracelet.  As such, it is probably best to read the stories in order so as not to spoil the ending. I bought the book mostly because I like Julia Quinn.  Her story of a girl falling in love with her dead brother's best friend was entirely believable and surprisingly well developed for such a short story.  (I do have to say that I noticed a trend of dead brothers in this anthology, a fact which I find slightly disconcerting) The second story (by Mia Ryan) is the reason I knocked a star off the total.  Her story about an earl falling in love with his party planner felt forced and cliched.  Every time something implausible happened (approx every 30 seconds) I would groan and bang my hand against the wall.  Needless to say by the end my neighbors were quite annoyed with me.  Let me give an example from the book: during one of their meetings the heroine tells the earl that she knew from their first meeting that he was a perfect gentleman (never mind that on their first meeting the earl had mistaken her for his paramour - who was conveniently forgotten during the rest of the story - and basically fondled her behind and kissed her).  But it wasn't all bad - Lady W's commentary provided some much needed entertainment. The third story was a surprising gem (considering I hadn't read anything of Enoch's before), possibly my favorite.  A proper girl falls in love with a man her parents dissaprove of, forcing them to court in secret.  Wonderfully written, although I would have liked a little more closure. The final story was of a different formula than the first three (in which rake met girl of dreams and had a miraculous reformation of character).  A viscount returns home to his wife, after 12 years away, after she writes demanding an annulment.  Very humorous and full of the witty banter one expects from Karen Hawkins.  Unlike the other stories there was even a very likeable secondary character, in the form of the heroine's brother. The bottom line:  It's a well-written anthology worth having on your shelf, but unless you have plenty of spare time you don't mind wasting skip the second story.",

         "FIRST KISS, THE - Julia Quinn - Peter Thompson is home from Waterloo, one of the fortunate to survive and wants nothing more than to settle down with a biddable wife on a small farm somewhere.  His prospects are not that good, being the second son of a minor baron, he is in London to find a suitable bride with a relatively good dowry.  As it happens he is at the most sought after dinner party put on by Lady Greely, he comes face to face with Lady Mathilde `Tilly' Howard, sister of his best friend Harry who didn't survive.  He knew by her close resemblance to Harry who she was without being introduced, but more than that he was attracted by her sincere and sweet manner. Knowing that she was daughter of an Earl and an heiress to boot he knew he'd have to look elsewhere or be labeled a fortune hunter.  Tilly attracted as she was by this handsome, intelligent and honorable hunk thought to change his mind!  Totally charming, very cute and funny  - 5* The LAST TEMPTATION - Mia Ryan  ---  Isabella `Bella' Martin has been Lady Greely's companion and party planner for the last ten years and has been quite adept at hiding in the shadows. A spinster fast approaching her 30th birthday and never been kissed which she vows to change before that fateful birthday.  Lord Anthony Roxbury, 37 and heir to the Earldom has no intention to marry in spite of the weekly sessions with his father continually stressing the reasons why it is his duty to marry and procreate. Having too much fun it is the last thing on his mind until he mistakes Bella for one of his assignations and she not only gets a kiss but a relatively nice grope before she shockingly rears back and almost breaks his nose.  Through the blood and the apologies, Anthony discovers that this very self deprecating spinster is a breath of fresh air and decides he must see more (and more) of her.  Wonderfully romantic -  5* The BEST OF BOTH WORLDS - Suzanne Enoch ---  Charlotte Birling is allowed no chance at all of ever being mentioned in Lady Whistledown's column, ever since she was seven and her cousin had married in haste and then been deserted by Lord Easterly.  But a girl could dream and the dream rode by her house every morning on his way to Gentlemen Jacksons.  Her dream was the very handsome Earl Xavier Matson who since coming to town was making a name for himself with his womanizing exploits.  When Xavier chances to overhear Charlotte at a function standing up against Lady Greely for accusing someone of stealing her bracelet without so much as a shred of evidence, Xavier is intrigued.  No. she might have been plaine and  she certainly wasn't the type he'd been pursuing in a search for a wife but there was something about her that did kindle his interest - an interest that Lord and Lady Birling were adamant of nipping in the bud.  - But alas, we all know that love will win out!  -  Totally awesome for such a short novella!  5* The ONLY ONE FOR ME - Karen Hawkins --- Sophia (cousin of Charlotte Birling Throckmorton Hampton, Viscountess Easterly was abandoned by her husband Max, the Viscount Easterly twelve years earlier.  Abandoned after she failed to show him support when he was accused of cheating. Max's pride would not allow him to deny what he felt was an insult to his honor. On their brother Richard's deathbed, Sophia and her brother John Throckmorton, Earl of Standwick would discover that Richard was the real culprit who allowed Max to shoulder the blame.  After not seeing him for 12 years other than missives from his solicitor, Max showed up at Lady Greely's shocking Sophia.  His mere presence was all it took to re-ignite the passion both held for each other. When the blame for the theft of Lady Greely's bracelet threatened to implicate Max, Sophia was determined to discover the real culprit, if only to atone for her lack of faith that caused him to walk away so many years ago - but also - could it be she still cared!!!  Sweetly endearing, snappy dialog and a lot of sensual teasing....  5* OVERALL - In this sparkling anthology, these marvelous authors all picked up a thread on the mystery of the missing bracelet to blend them all into one full length story with several sub-plots each with its own delightful romance. Although it would be hard to pick my favorite, I think it would be Enoch's story with Charlotte solving the problem of her parents objections of Earl Matson so very cleverly in front of the guests at the ball!  This is not to say that they were not all delightful - just my personal favorite!  A superior effort by all authors and one I highly recommend. --- Submitted by Marilyn, Official Reviewer for  [...]  ---",

He randomly travels through time into different periods of his life from the bombing in Dresden to his time with the aliens on Planet Tralfamdore.  He is constantly running into random characters on his adventures, some of which appear in other Vonnegut books, even Vonnegut himself.  Because he can time travel he has already seen all the events in his life before they actually happen, the bombing of Dresden, his children, the death of his wife, even his own death.  So it goes.  All of these events converge together randomly throughout paragraphs of writing to form a story... My review: I am having the hardest time putting the synopsis of this book into words.

That is certainly true of Clara Barton ((December 25, 1821 - April 12, 1912) who founded and served as the first president of the American Red Cross (ARC) in 1881, an affiliate of International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and its humanitarian work during the Franco-Prussian War. Created in 1864, the ICRC had been chartered to provide humane services to all victims of war under a flag of neutrality and that has continued to be true of the ARC, also, given the involvement of U.S. forces in various wars throughout the last 127 years. As is true of the other volumes in this series, this mini-biography is based on rock-solid historical material and includes a number of archival photos to supplement the lively narrative created by the Time editors in collaboration with Anna Prokos.

         5,
         "The long novels of Thomas Mann can prove challenging, not unlike those of Henry James. Fortunately, this varied collection - Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories - offers an easier way to become acquainted with Mann's intellectual, psychologically complex literature. Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures markedly complicate the task of translation. H. T. Lowe-Porter's translation is considered the most accessible version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's sentences. (For comparison with an excellent literal version, look at Stanley Appelbaum's translation of Death in Venice, Dover Publications, 1995). Death in Venice and Seven Other Stories was first published by Vintage Books in 1954. My edition was printed by Vintage International in 1989; it has neither an introduction nor explanatory notes. Death in Venice (1911):  While vacationing in Venice, the aging, highly respected author Gustave Ashenbach becomes mesmerized by a young boy staying at the seashore with his Polish aristocratic family. Although intellectually aware of his growing obsession, Ashenbach is unable to break away.  This somber portrayal of a troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances that illustrates Thomas Mann's ability to create layers of meaning. Tonio Kroger (1903) is perhaps more biographical as it explores a writer's internal conflict between his desire to be accepted, that is to fit in to a bourgeois life, and his contradictory need to follow his artistic temperament wherever it might lead him. Mario and the Magician (1929) is more explicitly political, depicting in the guise of an unscrupulous hypnotist a Mussolini-like character. The ending of this intriguing account is a surprise. The setting in Disorder and Early Sorrow (1925) is Munich, less than a decade after World War I, amid rampant inflation and social upheaval. The narrator, Professor Cornelius, is saddened by the loss of tradition, exemplified by modern art, music, and dance forms so popular with his older children, now young adults. He finds refuge in his study of history. Early sorrow refers to an incident involving his five year-old daughter, Ellie. A Man and His Dog (1918) is personal, humorous, and almost idyllic, quite different from the more serious topics addressed in the other stories in this collection. The Blood of the Walsungs (1905) is the most disturbing story in this collection. The two key characters exhibit an aristocratic arrogance and elitism that culminates in incest. In an opera scene Mann draws a close parallel between his two protagonists and Siegmund and Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walkure. Tristan (1902) has been described as a retelling of the legend of Tristan and Isolde set in a sanatorium. Detlev Spinell, a tuberculosis patient staying in the Dr. Leander's medical facility, becomes infatuated with another patient, Herr Kloterjahn's wife. Spinell is a largely unsuccessful writer, one that has difficulty relating to others. In Felix Krull (1911) the narrator is a self-serving, unscrupulous, amoral, confidence man that is somehow likeable. The story ends abruptly, leaving the reader wondering what happens next.  Forty years later Thomas Mann resumed work on this story and in 1954 he published the novel The Confessions of Felix Krull, a light, often hilarious account of a man who wins the favor and love of others by enacting the roles that they desire of him. Thomas Mann was born in Germany in 1875. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929. He left Germany in 1933, living primarily in Switzerland and the United States until his death in 1955.",

         5,
         "Death in Venice (1912) is a disturbing story, one that is not easy to forget. It is also exceptional literature, a classic of the twentieth century. Thomas Mann's Death in Venice might be best compared to the subtle, psychologically complex fiction of Henry James, Joseph Conrad, and Fyodor Dostoevsky. In Munich the aging, highly respected author Gustav Aschenbach is in need of change, rest in a new setting, to overcome his growing fatigue that is impacting his writing. While recovering in Venice, Aschenbach slowly, but inexorably, becomes mesmerized by a young Polish boy staying at the seashore with his aristocratic family. Aschenbach is intellectually aware of his growing obsession, but he is seemingly unable to break away. Thomas Mann's somber portrayal of this troubled man is a masterpiece of subtle nuances and psychological intensity. Thomas Mann's lengthy sentences and complex grammatical structures severely complicate the task of translating Death in Venice. I have read two excellent and yet substantially different translations. The most faithful translation is by Stanley Appelbaum (in this Dover edition, 1995) that tries to be as literal as possible, carefully preserving the comparative length of the original sentences as well as the internal sequence of each original German sentence. Contrastingly, the H. T. Lowe-Porter translation (found elsewhere) is less literal, but is considered the most delightful and readable version, although at the expense of subdividing many of Mann's lengthy sentences. Lowe-Porter's version has been the standard translation for many years. The Dover edition provides an excellent 10-page commentary, including footnotes.",

         5,
         "I don't have much more to add to Grady Harp's effusive praise, except to say that I pretty much agree with his main points.  I first read the classic H.T. Lowe Porter translation in college and liked it then . . . anything for a thorough expose of what it means--or necessarily used to mean--to be gay and aging.  Even Lowe Porter's fusty Edwardian strains, imparting dignity and Olympian tragedy to the drama, seemed apt at the time for a life--in the middle of another pestilence--that seemed to offer no happy ending. But since then we've had Will and Grace and countless gay characters, mostly minor, in films and on TV--and one of the great things is that it's okay to laugh about it all.  Even at what we in the community used to call tragic and sometimes in our bitchier moments still do.  This translation invites us to smile, and even occasionally howl.  By giving Aschenbach an obsession with the Greek gods (toward the end he uses the words god and godlike about a dozen times in two pages), Mann not only shows us what was required at the time as a good alibi or cover for homosexual tendencies (not even \"identities\")--\"classical culture\" and \"noble classicism\" and so on: everything that involved nude boys and swimming hole frolics and attention served to youth and beauty in young beauties--but also gave us in the future (inadvertantly, I don't know, since I don't read German) the keys to understanding a period in which so-called bourgeois culture needed its literature and high art to justify the ancients' curious sexual habits.  An almost neurasthenic obsession with youth and health and beauty being an ironic side feature of cultured life. The result for Mann, in one instance, is a wonderfully dry scene in which the old writer goes to the barber and frowns at his \"pinched face\" in the mirror, thereby unleashing a torrent of rationales from the barber for working his own art on the aging artist: dye job, little curl here and there, rouge.  It's an astoundingly paced and worded moment, and what it leads up to is more dramatic and complex than I remembered in the most famous version.  It's not so much about loneliness and a necessarily tragic life, it turns out in this makeover, as about the way we hide ourselves, cloak ourselves, in the identities the world wants to see.  That's the tragedy Mann's getting at.  Now the yellowing lenses of post-Victorianism have been lifted to reveal this more clearly. So, three cheers for Michael Henry Heim--and five stars!",

         "Thomas Mann wrote one of the most beautiful novels ever. `Death in Venice' is short but it has more depth that many novels with hundred of pages. By the way, the conciseness is a great value of this little jewel. The most important thing in this narrative is the development of Gustav von Aschenbach, the protagonist. And Mann does succed in doing that. Once he was a famous writer that is now decadent. He goes to Venice, where he expects to have a great time and relax. Little did he know that he would find a great obsession that would bring up the worst in him. Aschenbach's passion and obsession is not the one we usually think of. There is not a sexual attraction to the teenager Tadzio, the protagonist is much more concerned on the beauty and its aesthetic rather than what we would call love. Mann's prose is slow going, but very beautiful what makes the book so worthwhile reading. His descriptions bring to the pages the best of Venice, and the more we appreciate the city, the less we like Aschenbach. His decadent story may be depressive, but it iluminates many issues --mostly the ones about love, beauty and obessession. There is a film version of `Death in Venice' that is quite close to the novella. Both book and movie are very beautiful and high recommended to people who like great literature and cinema.",

         5,
         "Kerry Max Cook met young Linda Edwards in 1977 and was invited back to her apartment for a drink, where he left his fingerprints on the sliding glass door. Four days later, Ms. Edwards was found brutally murdered, and Cook was immediately arrested for the crime.  In one of the worst examples of police and prosecutorial misconduct in American history, Kerry Max was put to trial with coached prosecutorial witnesses, bunk expert testimony about the \"age\" (six to twelve hours) of the fingerprint, and suppressed evidence that would have favored the defense.  The state declared that Kerry Max was a repressed homosexual (at a time when homosexuality was a mental illness, and in rural Texas, no less) who raped and butchered a female out of repressed rage - a theory, incredibly, they stuck to even during re-trials two decades later, in the 1990's! Chasing Justice is the story of the framing of Kerry Max by the Texas justice system.  The narrative was written in Kerry's own hand (1,200 pages at first draft) and condensed into a powerfully personal 350-page account of life on death row - desperation, abandonment, rape and sodomy, stabbings, and attempted suicide.  The prose isn't depressing; rather, Kerry Max just fights on, always waiting for the next turn, building his cadre of supporters.  Texas death row has been ruled in federal court to constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  Kerry Max fought for a full two decades for his freedom, through three outrageous trials, with not a penny to his name.  While the major Dallas newspaper was decrying the railroading of an innocent man, he was convicted again and again and again.  To date, he is still not eligible for reparations from the state of Texas because he has not been officially pardoned, which would require the unanimous concurrence several bureaucratic offices unwilling to admit their culpability in the grave trespass of justice against Kerry Max Cook.  (By the way, the state spent $5 - $7 million over two decades in their effort to execute Kerry Max). The reader will question - why Kerry Max?  In his book, the author does not devote his energies to answering why, rather, he uses his energy to fight.  From some brief research on the case, I have determined that the real culprit hired a very expensive, well-connected good ol' boy lawyer, requiring the police to find another suspect to satisfy the anger of the community.  I can only begin to wonder how the Texas justice system conspired for 20 years to keep an innocent man behind bars.  During each of his three trials, judges continually approved motions by the prosecutor and denied those of the defense, even to the point at which the court had contradicted itself on which evidence should be suppressed or allowed and for what reason! Kerry Max's remarkable story is a damning indictment of the death penalty and the Texas justice system.  Right before the publication of his memoir, national crime show Body of Evidence:  From the Case Files of Dayle Hinman featured forensic experts \"solving\" the Edwards murder based on false evidence from the prosecution.  Even 10 years have Kerry Max's exoneration in the national eye, misinformation is still being spread by those in power.  Kerry Max Cook's experiences should serve as clear warning not to blindly accept the word of authority.",

         5,
         "This is one in a series of inexpensive but superbly produced biographies created for younger readers (ages 7-9) that enable them to gain a much better understanding and appreciation of key figures throughout U.S. history, most of whom also had significant impact worldwide. That is certainly true of Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 - April 7, 1947) whose \"light, low-priced car with an up-to-date engine of ample horsepower, and built of the very best material [would eventually] put the world on wheels.\" Moreover, the Ford Motor Company shocked the business world when it announced (on January 5, 1914) that it would increase the wage of its workers to five dollars a day (almost twice what his and other auto companies had been paying) while reducing the work day from nine hours to eight. According to Ford, \"The five dollar day was the greatest cost-cutting move I ever made\" as company doubled its profits from $30-million in 1914 to $60-million two years later. How important is Henry Ford? It is difficult to think of another business leader who had a greater impact on his nation's economy, indeed on the societies and economies of other nations throughout the Americas, the UK, Europe, and Asia in which the dream of possessing an affordable automobile became a reality. Young people need to understand how Ford helped to develop \"a car for everyone,\" the subject of Chapter 5. They also need to understand how Ford's contributions helped to create \"a new middle class,\" the subject of Chapter 6. These and other subjects (e.g. the development of an interstate highway system as well as the transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial economy and the consequent population shifts that substantially increased the population of metropolitan areas) are all worthy of additional study. Henry Ford was directly or at least indirectly involved in most of the major changes in \"the American way of life\" during the first half of the 20th century. He once observed, \"Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.\" Early in his life, he had several bold ambitions and was convinced that he could achieve all of them. More often than not, he was right. As is true of the other volumes in this series, this mini-biography is based on rock-solid historical material and includes a number of archival photos to supplement the lively narrative created by the Time editors in collaboration with Dina El Nabli. I feel obligated to add, that this is not a book written for younger \"dummies\" or \"idiots.\" It ought to be in all school and public libraries and would also be an excellent birthday or holiday gift for children, one that parents, grandparents, and other relatives should consider. Those who wish to learn more about Henry Ford are urged to check out his autobiography, My Life and Work, Steven Watts's The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century, The Fords: An American Epic co-authored by Peter Collier and David Horowitz, and Douglas G. Brinkley's Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress.",

         "Assassin Luther Green is a patriot. He serves his country in the way he knows best--by following orders and by killing those who are deemed a threat to the nation. When he's called back to headquarters, he knows this won't be a routine kill. Still, he's startled to learn that his next assignment is the man who brought him into E-1, the secret agency responsible for America's ultimate sanctions. Alex had trained him, inspired him, but now he's a threat to the country--and Luther knows how to follow orders. The only problem is, something about this particular job stinks. It doesn't take Luther long to realize that he's following a trail that Alex has carefully laid down. Alex is trying to teach Luther something, show him something about E-1 that would prove that the Agency has gone off-wire. Luther isn't buying, and even if he did, he's been assigned a job and he intends to complete it. Alex's trail takes him through the inner cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and finally Detroit--cities where drugs and guns cheapen life to the point where professional assassins fit right in. Alex's message is getting through, but Luther has sacrificed his entire life to his country and isn't about to be stopped. Only when the true coverup becomes known can Luther confront the real enemy. Author Gary Hardwick delivers an exciting story of assassination, martial arts action, and inner-city drama. Making Luther a black protagonist in a profession dominated by whites adds to the conflict--and heightens his sense of betrayal when the secrets are finally revealed. Hardwick's writing is occasionally clunky, but mostly workmanlike, moving the story along while deepening the reader's interest and buy-in to the characters. Overall, THE EXECUTIONER'S GAME is definitely worth the read.",

         "I've started reading this series after having gone through the Edgewater series.  \"The Oracle Betrayed\" already promises that this series will be much better and more satisfying.  The characters are well rounded, the dialogue is believable, and while there is a lot of action, it all flows together as part of an overarching plot, rather than as individual episodes.  This book will appeal to both girls and boys. Catherine Fisher does a great job of making the world of this story come to life.  The brutality of life in the ancient world is made evident.  As she describes the crowded city streets, details such as rotting garbage and the odor of dead animals make it extremely vivid and realistic.  And then this is contrasted with the sumptuous City of the Dead, where the high ranking inhabitants lack for nothing, even precious water while the poor are reeling from the effects of the long-lasting drought. The two main characters, Mireny and Seth, are flawed which makes them more believable than they would have been if they had been gung-ho, able-to-do-everything types.  Mireny is priestess but she doesn't believe the in the existence of her god, and by nature she is shy and uncomfortable around people.  Over the course of the book her faith changes and she gains confidence.  Seth begins as an arrogant scribe who gets drawn into the plot initially as a means of achieving his ambitions, but he too grows and his motives change. A previous reviewer complained that the meaning of everything is not spelled out at the beginning.  That's actually what makes for sophisticated storytelling, and makes this a book that will appeal to various ages.  As you read on the various layers of the the mystery are revealed and the various threads of the plot come together. For parents who are evaluating this book there are a couple of things to be aware of.  Although this is listed as book for 9 yr olds, it probably is more appropriate starting at 11 to 12 year olds due to some more mature elements.  There is a scene of ritual sacrifice, and while it is not graphic  it might be disturbing to some kids.  Also there is a brief scene that takes place in an opium den.  Otherwise I highly recommend this book.  It's enjoyable for anyone who enjoys a mix of mystery and fantasy.",

This story was just as good, if not better.  Where Savannah Blues centered on Weezie Foley, Savannah Breeze focuses on her best friend, BeBe Loudermilk. Loudermilk owns one of the most successful and trendy restaurants in Savannah, as well as a number of rental properties.  At the annual Telfair Ball, Loudermilk meets the hunky, sexy, and refined Ryan Edward Millbanks, III.  They become an item almost immediately.  When her life becomes complicated by the hospitalization of her grandmother, Millbanks (an investment banker) starts taking over the care of her properties.  Before she knows what is happening, Millbanks has disappeared and she is told by the police that he is a con-artist.  Not only that, but he has swindled Loudermilk out of almost everything she owned including her house and all her possessions.  The only property she is left with (besides her restaurant which she can no longer afford to operate) is a dilapidated set of beach cottages on Tybee Island.  Millbanks used her money to buy The Breeze Inn, but didn't get a chance to liquidate the property before he had to leave Savannah. At first, Loudermilk is unsure of what to do with The Breeze Inn. She can sell the property for a small fortunate to a developer.  But finding herself homeless, she decides to renovate the cottages and make one of them her home with the help of caretaker Harry and with Weezie's vintage furniture.  She also hatches a plot to find Millbanks and to get her money back.  This escapade is a hoot and involves Weezie, Harry and Granddaddy Loudermilk. Andrews' books are always fun, but they also come with a message.  In Savannah Breeze, we learn that sometimes we find love in the most unlikely places.  Material possessions are way over-rated in bringing us happiness.  And sometimes what you think might be a personal catastrophe can actually turn out to be a good thing. I have already purchased another Andrews' book, Blue Christmas--she's that good.",

         "Here is another children's book that I just could not get into at all. I read the first 75 pages, and even those were tough to get through. As a true Harry Potter fan, I found this book to be seriously missing the mark in the fantasy-magic genre. The characters were not well-written, and for me, when the characters aren't fully developed, I have a very hard time caring at all about any of them. The storyline just bored me to pieces, and a few elements seemed a little too familiar if you are an HP fan (i.e. a spiral staircase that winds its way up a tower, a character with the last name \"Trelawney\"). I think kids (probably ages 8 to 11) might enjoy this book if they already like the wizard/magic fantasy genre. But this book just did not do it for me.",

         5,
         "I am a philosopher and a specialist in Islamic studies with years of experience teaching Islam.  This book is absolutely fantastic!  With care and precision the author demonstrates the diversity of opinions among Muslims in ways that simplify but do not oversimplify the expressions of the adherents to that faith.  Far too many Christian conservatives want to argue that there is some \"essence\" of Islam, which if rightly understood endorses terrorism.  The author exposes this fatuous argument.  He clearly positions himself within Islam as a moderate or progressive, but is careful to show the historical origins of more conservative expressions of the faith.  I assigned this book in a grad course and it helped my students grasp the diversity within Islamic jurisprudence.  By the end of the course, when asked, \"What does Islam teach about....?\" they responded, \"Which expression of Islam?\"  If you tend to think of Islam as a unified monolithic, if not monotone, religion, read this book and learn to see it differently.  Another book written by a Christian evangelical who grasps the diversity within Islam is Matthew Stone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Reaching-the-Heart-and-Mind-of-Muslims/dp/B00F000ISE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Reaching the Heart and Mind of Muslims</a>.

Regardless of not knowing the previous story, BeBe's story was easy to jump into and you never feel too lost not knowing the characters previously.  BeBe Loudermilk, a three time divorcee' has found herself in another humiliating situation: a man posed as the perfect man and managed to perfectly leave her without anything besides the clothes on her back, the car she was driving, her restaurant that she can't afford to keep open and... the Breeze Motel.  With nothing else to loose, BeBe heads out to the Breeze and finds Hank, the cranky manager and a hotel that is in needs of lots of work - work she can't redily afford. This novel is a great fun to read and I found myself flying through the pages.  The things that happen to BeBe somewhat seem a bit farfetched but Mary Kay Andrews tells it so simply and honestly that it seems that you could be reading the story of your friend who found herself in a pickle.

         "BeBe Loudermilk comes from old money in Savannah, GA.  Not one to live off her family's money, she has cultivated a life for herself as one of the most successful businesswomen in Savannah.  She owns a restaurant called Guale, has rental properties across the city, and manages her grandparents' money in her spare time.  What she doesn't have time for, however, is to meet a good man after her three divorces.  When she meets Reddy Millbanks at a black-tie fundraiser, he sweeps her off her feet and does everything in his power to uncomplicate her hectic life.  Soon Reddy is taking care of BeBe's rental properties for her while she helps out her grandparents and they begin working together on some business ventures.  Then before she knows it, Reddy has left town and run off with not only BeBe's money, but her grandparents' too.  With not a cent left to her name, BeBe learns that the only thing she has left is an old motel on Tybee Island called the Breeze Inn that Reddy bought and had yet to unload.  With no place else to go, BeBe moves to the Breeze and revamps the place so that she can slowly rebuild her fortune.  The whole time, though, Reddy Millbanks is on her mind, and she vows that she'll get back everything that he took from her. Savannah Breeze is fun, entertaining Southern fiction.  Mary Kay Andrews has a great voice and does an excellent job of bringing forth all Southern imagery with her descriptions of life in Savannah and the beach.  Having just moved up north from Georgia, this book made me homesick with its stories of sweet tea, fresh fishing, and Southern hospitality.  That and a take-no-prisoners heroine, her equally quick-witted best friend, and Southern gentlemen who know how to treat a lady made this book a joy to read.  Savannah Breeze is the type of book you want to read on the beach when you're on a vacation from work and have time to sit around with a drink and enjoy it (there's a great drink recipe at the end of the book that would be perfect for your beach lounging).  But since it's the middle of the winter, I'd instead suggest reading it on a weekend afternoon, again with a cocktail, when you're in the mood for a good time with some outrageous characters and funny, romantic fiction.",

         3,
         "\"The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists\", the name and it's subtitle imply to a potential reader that this book might touch an array of topics that Islam faces today. Although I truly believe Dr. El Fadl had the right concept in his writing, the book seems to fall just shy of  encircling the entire meaning of what problems and challenges the religion of Islam faces today. If you undertake writing a book with the premise of \"Wrestling Islam from the Extremists\", you most certainly should see some sort of grave villainy within different factions of the faith.  The term \"extremists\" seems to be left on the cover, never to be repeated throughout the book's pages. In it's place Dr. El Fald uses the term \"Puritan\" and uses \"Moderate\" representing what we assume are modern Muslims who adequately change with contemporary times.  The phrase \"Puritan\" is someone who is \"of strict moral code\". I personally feel that it does not even begin to describe sufficiently enough the past and present Islamic extremists. Certainly puritans of any religion represent a group who seek for it's members to stay true to that religion's ethnical and moral guidelines. If what we hear about from the \"moderate\" Muslims about what \"true\" Islam is wouldn't the \"Puritans\" be the side calling for returning to it's authentic meaning and practices?  If what Dr. El Fadl and many others say about true Islam's stance on terrorism, warfare, women's rights, violations  human rights, etc. are fact, then wouldn't the \"Puritans\" be the faction who forbid terrorism, warfare, violations in women's and human rights, etc? Instead, in his view, he believes the \"puritans\" are the side that turns a blind eye towards these things including terrorism and even advocates them. As well as the \"true\" meaning of Jihad. If it's purist form is, as he describes \"to strive, to apply oneself to struggle, to persevere....Therefore, cleansing oneself, from vanity, and pettiness, pursuing knowledge, curing the ill, feeding the poor, and standing up for the truth and justice are all forms of Jihad (pg. 221)\" then wouldn't the \"puritan\" side be calling for this interpretation as opposed to the Jihad embedded in terrorism we hear chanted in justification of ruthless actions?  It is a rather difficult job, if not impossible job to simply distinguish just who are Muslim \"puritans\" and who are Muslim \"moderates\". The issues that Dr. El Fadl discusses are issues that Muslim opinions vary greatly on. It is almost too complex to easily brand an all encompassing term such as \"puritan\" or \"moderate\" and begin to proclaim just who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\" .For instance; would a majority of Palestinian Muslims be considered \"puritan\" or \"moderate\"? If divisions exist between the two classifications on issues such as the use of terrorism, should we assume most Palestinian Muslims are \"puritans\"? Taking into consideration the numerous polls showing high numbers in favor of using terrorism against civilians, is the greater majority \"puritan\"? But in fact, many among them enjoy freedoms proscribed by the \"puritan\" sect of Islam, such as shaving of the beard, wearing of the hijab, dancing, the role of women, etc.. On page 230, Dr. El Fadl refers to the Prophet himself being upset and reproaching his army for killing a noncombatant. If puritans strive to keep their religion as true to the Prophet's actions as possible, why do they not condone the killing of noncombatants today? Certainly even some \"moderate\" Muslims fall short in this area as well , considering the Muslim world's acceptance of terrorist attacks such as 9/11 and bombings in London, Madrid, Beirut, etc. Page 235 reads; \"The Quran repeatedly emphasizes that God does not like aggression and does not love aggressors.\" Have Puritans not read and reread the Quran enough? Or even has the Prophet Mohammad failed practice what he preached in that area? Page 236 reads \"The Quran instructs Muslims to `cultivate forgiveness, enjoin goodness, and turn away from the ignorant'\" Perhaps this virtue needs to be reinforced today. He states that the Quran only justifies the use of violence as a way of defending oneself. Isn't that jello-mold of a explanation that can and is twisted and formed by some to justify using it today? Is Al Qaeda a group of \"puritans\" defending themselves? Are the Janjaweed \"puritans\" simply defending themselves?  Both of which, Dr El Fadl ceases to write about in his book. It almost appears to a reader that he wants to criticize certain Muslims, be is reluctant to do so he brands them an indistinctive all encompassing term of \"puritan\" and reminds readers that only \"moderate\" Muslims see a clear perception of Islam. I repeat that the label of \"puritan\" is not adequate enough in beginning to show just who the \"extremists\" are. They seem to have strayed from their religion and are not even in fact trying to keep it pure but are living in their own warped world of self righteousness and attempting to interpret a twisted view of \"the well of God\".  Possibly the answer does not even lie in the realm of spirituality itself. Maybe who Dr. El Fadl describes as \"puritans\" are most likely frenetic bedlamites misjudging how to carry out their own daily political and social life while practicing a very frail religious life. Harshness should be laid upon where needed when speaking about serious consequences of modern conflicts within Islam. Unfortunately the first maybe six chapters of \"The Great Theft\" can be hard to get though if you don't hold a PhD in Middle Eastern History or Theology complemented by an obsession for knowledge of religious foundations.  At times, parts can even be lengthy and redundant in some areas. Maybe if a reader can muscle through the sometimes incoherent Quranic verses and quotations of deceased Arab scholars and jurists with unpronounceable 10-12 syllable names , then you may just be fortunate enough make it to the latter half of the book. The most interesting and worthwhile chapters are without a doubt the last two chapters; Chapter 11 \"Jihad, Warfare, and Terrorism\" and Chapter 12 \" Nature & Role of Women\". Noting that both are of particular relevant to today`s world.  It is clear though that Dr. El Fadl is a brilliant scholar and thinker who can without a doubt see many problems lying within the Islamic world. He falls short of sometimes reciting specifically where they might lie and even is wary of giving criticism where criticism is due. Over all any inconsistencies in his theories and some long drawn out parts, the book is a decent read. Especially as events in the news come about daily involving Muslims reflecting Dr. El Fadl's writing. I would recommend it to anyone longing to dive deeper into an understanding of Islam and contentions involving the faith today.",

         4,
         "I used to be quite the fan of Kurt Vonnegut. I found his trenchant observations of human nature both biting and hilarious. To be exposed to this man's writings at a young age was a welcome epiphany that not everything was right with the universe. Consequently, I devoured most of his essays, novels, and short stories in the span of a few years. But like that person who leaves the last bite of a delicious meal til the last second, I saved a few unread gems for later in life. As for this novel, I wouldn't say Galapagos is anything less than one of Vonnegut's finest fictional offerings. Everything that defines the man's writing is there; hopelessly flawed characters trying to make sense of an otherwise insensible world; cosmic turns of fate that deny us any lasting happiness; and the inevitable decline of man due to his baser selfish nature, all of which is woven into a satirical tapestry that lays out the absurdity of the human race for all to see. But here's the thing; I'm not the same person I used to be in my twenties. True, I've known my share of human deceptiveness and manipulation. I've had my fill of empty friendships and jaded, selfish individuals... but the older I get, the less cynical I am. In fact, I'm more optimistic than I have ever been, and that, more than anything else, makes his writing more and more inaccessible to me. I suppose that after what Vonnegut experienced during WWII, his prevailing, cynical worldview would be inevitable. And for a time I couldn't get enough of it. I mean, his message is rendered in the most succinct, humorous prose imaginable, but I can't help but feel he got stuck somewhere. He could never turn that corner on the human race, nor escape from his experiences in Dresden. He never let go of the notion that people were less than worthy of this earth of ours. And where that philosophy once used to cast a sickly smile across my face, it's no longer there. Nor is my enjoyment of a writer I once considered to be one of America's finest.",

A quick, delightful read that can stand on its own, MAGYK is, without a doubt, an intriguing page-turner. Septimus Heap, the seventh son of a seventh son, died shortly after birth. Born to a family of Wizards, there's no telling what he might have become, as his lineage as a seventh son would have made him unbelievably magical. But on that winter night when Septimus died, his father, Silas, found another newborn child in the forest. They named her Jenna, and she grew up thinking that she was the daughter of Silas and Sarah Heap, and the sister of six older brothers--Simon, Sam, Edd, Erik, Nicko, and Jo-Jo. Early on, though, Sarah had her own ideas of who Jenna really was, especially when she heard the news that the Queen had been murdered. Jenna Heap was, undoubtedly, the Princess. Over the next ten years, darkness came to the Castle and the Ramblings, where the Heaps lived. With no Queen, evil came in the form of the Supreme Custodian, who along with his cohorts banned magic and ended the happiness the Queen's people had once known. As the Heap family attempt to ride out this time of darkness, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, learns of the plot to kill the Princess, which will allow evil to truly take over the Palace. It seems that the only thing keeping DomDaniel, the Dark Wizard, from returning to the Castle is the presence of the Princess, and he plans to remedy that. What follows is the flight of Jenna, Nicko, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and a Young Army recruit known only as Boy 412 to the Marram Marshes, where Aunt Zelda Heap, a White Witch, will be able to keep them from harm. As events unfold and DomDaniel does everything within his power to track down the girl standing between him and a ruling darkness, the Heap family will have to do everything within their means to stop him--and at the same time stay alive. MAGYK is a delightful, entertaining story filled with action-adventure and fantasy. With a very large cast of characters who are as diverse as they come, this is one story not to be missed. If you like Harry Potter, you will definitely enjoy Septimus Heap. Filled with twists and turns, this is a story you'll stay up reading long into the night.

Every time I thought of reading it, the reviews said you'd either love it or hate it, and I figured with my luck in picking books, it would be another dud. When my colleague who like all the books I hate told me I absolutely had to read it, that was another incentive not to touch it. But boy am I glad I finally caved in and read it! I was hooked from the very beginning, and went to sleep way too late for my own good way too many nights because I couldn't put it down. It's really hard to explain why I liked the book. The story is exactly as improbable as it's described in the synopsys: Shadow is a guy who just got out of prison, whose beloved wife died, with no job prospects. A stranger who calls himself Mr Wednesday and who seems to know more about Shadow than he should offers him a job as driver and hired help. Shadow accepts and is given a glimpse of how gods and magical beings that live among us, forgotten and replaced by new gods: the media, technology, money. Shadow is a pretty dull, empty character, and there's no breakneck action. So what's so good about this book? If you like mythology, you'll probably like the book. And I am not talking about dime a dozen mythology, you know, greek gods in sandals, cartoon gods in costumes, etc. You may need to look up many of the gods up to figure out who they are and what they are about. I strongly recommend you do that by the way, and I suspect many who couldn't make sense of the book didn't bother to do that, and therefore didn't understand why the various gods did what they did, or said what they said. Make a little effort, with the help of technology it's not even that hard, and learn something about these characters and the cultures that created them. Even if you end up not liking the book, you'll have learned something and will therefore be a better person because of it. If Shadow is dull, the gods we meet along the way are vivid and interesting, and more than make up for Shadow's lackluster character. In fact pretty much everyone other than Shadow is very interesting and engaging. And the way the gods are woven into the normal everyday human society is (strangely) convincing, because they manage to stay in character even in the most mundane situations. I don't know if this review makes you want to read the book or not. As I said, there was nothing appealing to me about it until I read and, then I wished I had read it sooner.

         "Two boys, who on the outside couldn't be more different.  Harlan Chesterton is good looking, popular, the rich son of a prominent Senator.  He's an ace on the school swim team, he's dating the beautiful Amber, his best friend, Ricky, has street cred.  If it weren't for the debilitating panic attacks, along with the flashes of tragic premonition that Harlan experiences, his life would be perfect.  After all, that's what his mother is aiming for--running the lives of her husband and son until every detail is absolutely perfect. Manny Tucker, on the other hand, is a geek.  A theater geek, to be exact.  Never one to attract attention, Manny prefers working behind the scenes with the lighting, bringing the stars of the stage into perfect, shining glory.  He's not popular, he's often picked on by the other kids in school, and his good friend, Elsa, is deaf.  He likes working on the computer, coming up with movies to film with Elsa, and living a simple life with his single-father dad.  Except lately he's been having vivid nightmares that seem to portend a tragic ending. How is it that two boys, so far removed on both a social and financial level, should share the same feelings of dread and uncertainty that Harlan and Manny do?  And how is the intersection of Grand and Humble, a scene which both see in their unwanted \"visions\" of either the past or future, involved? GRAND & HUMBLE is an engaging mystery that delves into the paranormal.  The result is a thriller with twists and turns and a surprise ending that will leave even the best of detectives guessing until the final page.  Not to be missed by all lovers of a good, thought-provoking \"what if\" story, GRAND & HUMBLE is sure to please!",

         "American Gods (10th Aniversary Edition) by Neil Gaiman...is surprisingly captivating, at least it was for me. This book was recommended to me by a relative.  I waxed and waned about whether to read it, not sure if this science fiction/ fantasy tale was really my cup of tea, but I found myself sucked in.  Somehow, in some strange way, it delivered something within the story that kept pulling me back in. Now, for me,  it's layout, flow, whatever you want to call it would, normally, have totally turned me off.  It didn't t flow easily from scence to scence, it rather dashed madly about in a rather disjointed, short-story-type way.  I found myself many times confused,  while at the same time intrigued, mystified, and titilated.  But the main character stole my heart and I found my interest in him embuing me with a feeling of having a vested interest in his story. So if nothing else,  this book has once again reminded me to read outside my comfort zone and I can be pleasantly surprised.",

         3,
         "I have to admit that through much of The Floating World, I kept wishing for more.  Sometimes more characterization.  Sometimes more focus. Sometimes more editing.  Sometimes just something more.  At times I found it wonderfully written and moving, at times I considered putting it down for good (mostly the middle section), and by the end I was definitely glad I had kept going.  But at all those times it never felt it quite matched up to its potential of setting or character.  I can see some starting it and never finishing it, but despite its flaws, I'd recommend slogging through whatever tough parts you come across.   There are a lot of strengths to the book.  The Venetian setting for one, is beautifully described.  But its role goes beyond simple window-dressing.  Lovric does an impressive job of making Venice essential to the story, making it almost a character itself in the way that it impresses itself on the people in the book, the way it causes certain actions and reactions.  It's a masterful job.   Some of  the characterization is also extremely well-done, most particularly the couple at the center of the novel who share part of its narration--the printer Von Speyer and his wife.  Watching their marriage through all its highs and lows is at times exhilarating and at others achingly painful.  They are the most realized characters and the most effective ones and the book seldom slips when they remain its focus.   Other characters, unfortunately, aren't as strongly composed.  Sosia, another major character, starts out strong, but then seems to twist in the wind a bit, stagnating as a character before becoming more and more unlikable.  She is one of those missed-potential examples.  There are places where her character could be redeemed (as a literary character, not in the moral sense) but those points are either glossed over too quickly and come too late, making them ineffective.  In the end, you wanted more from her as a character, wanted to feel more for her.  The same is true for several of the minor characters, such as Sosia's husband or Bruno and Felice, two of her (many) lovers.  Plot events manipulate you into feeling certain things about their relationships, or at least feeling you should feel something, but the emotions aren't really earned by the writing, mostly because the characters aren't drawn sharply or realistically enough.   The book has some pacing problems I thought.  The opening is somewhat slow, but I'm always willing to forgive that in a book of this sort and in fact it picked up not too far into the book.  Large parts of the middle third or so, however, gave me serious pause and almost convinced me on several occasions to just give up.  The final third, though it maintained some of the book's flaws, moved along more quickly and more movingly, culminating in a strong close.   Structurally, the book moves back and forth in time and narration. There are periodic jumps to letter written from Catullus to his brother detailing his life in Rome, the motivation for/creation of/reaction to his poems (the present-time publication of which is one of the major focuses in the book).  The letters are interesting in their own right and the parallels between his time and what is happening in Venice, both in terms of events and characters, quickly become clear.  At times, almost too clear and on at least one occasion near the end, I thought one of the past revelations weakened the book's ending rather than enhanced it.  Whether you  like the use of this structure is probably a matter of personal taste; I found it effective at first and less so as the book went on.  In either case, it's easily followed.   The narrative shift is equally clear but much more effective and in contrast to the time shifts, grows more so as the book goes on, adding intimacy and an emotional weight that a third-person narration wouldn't quite achieve.   Overall, the book was disappointing, more in relation to what you felt it could have been.  The strengths of the book were so strong that they tended to highlight its weaknesses, so you were left with a lot of \"what if\" feeling.  Still, if they did highlight the weaknesses, those same strengths also made the book, in the end, worth reading.  Recommended, but with some sorrow, and with understanding should some not finish it.",

Just sit back and allow the beauty of the writing, the images, and the atmosphere carry you along. The book is a series of related stories that weave together like a Venetian tapestry, full of shifting colors and blurry hints of depth and emotion. One is the story of Sosia, a lovely, sensual, but shallow Jewish girl married to a good man whom she detests. She takes many lovers, men of every rank in 15th century Venice society. Another parallel story is about a German who has come to Venice to set up a printing press. Many themes twist and turn through the pages of The Floating Book, themes that include Judaism, faith, fate, the importance of the written word, jealousy, poetry, seduction - and taken together, they create the old Venice of that era. Hence the title: that Venice was like a floating book of ideas. The author is clearly in love with words, and perhaps there are a few too many of them. But still, it's a lovely and evocative read.",

         "The Value of a Good Introduction",
         5,
         "Unlike most novels, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" begins with an introduction that you have to read.  That is to say, most introductions are interesting and informative, but if you skip them you haven't really missed anything.  Not this one - if you want to read the novel, you are required to read the introduction.  That's just the way it is. I'm pleased to see that Kurt Vonnegut is now receiving the acknowledgment due him as a great American writer, and indeed received at least a part of that acknowledgment during his lifetime, but not as much as he will over the next few decades.  That's one reason you have to read the introduction.  Another is that Vonnegut's reputation rests primarily on a series of interconnected novels he published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is the last and probably best of these.  And finally, you have to read the introduction because it explains how and why he came to write the novel, and pretty much gives away the whole point of the piece. Under ordinary circumstances we would probably say that if we already know the point of a novel (or anything else), there's no reason to read it, but this is Kurt Vonnegut, remember.  In addition to everything else that was unique about him, he loved to talk to his readers, in person or in print.  You certainly read his novels because they're great, but you read them at least as much for the opportunity to hang out with the guy. Not to rehash the whole business, introduction or novel, but as the opening line declares, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is primarily about a man named Billy Pilgrim who has come unstuck in time.  He does not experience his life in a linear fashion, like you and I do.  Rather, he jumps around from event to event in his life randomly, and may find himself in any place or any period at any moment.  Which would be fascinating in and of itself, and made all the more so by the unbelievable things that Billy has been through, including the moments before his birth and after his death. You get to be with him as he works his way around Europe during World War II, eventually being captured by the Nazis and imprisoned, like his creator, in Dresden, just in time for the Allied bombing of the place.  You get to be with him during a perfectly normal upper-middle-class postwar lifestyle where he becomes an optometrist, marries the boss's daughter, prospers, and survives an airplane crash on his way to a convention.  You get to be with him when he's kidnapped by the alien Tralfamadorians for observation purposes, which is not as bad as it sounds when you consider that his captors are kind to him, teach him a great deal, and provide him with a companion in the form of a gorgeous adult-film star named Montana Wildhack. And you also get to be with him as he comes to realize from the Tralfamadorians that everything is eternal and immortal.  The aliens don't go through time in a linear fashion either, but unlike Billy, they are constantly present to every moment of time, from the creation of the universe to its destruction.  This is how Billy can be present on Tralfamadore with his gorgeous mistress and on Earth with his devoted wife both at the same time, and why he attempts to teach the world that nothing is ever lost.  He doesn't succeed, of course, but one of the best things about \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is that his failure doesn't bother him in the least, exactly because nothing is ever lost. Now, in some ways, this is kind of depressing, since it implies that the universe is going to go the way it goes no matter what we do, but Vonnegut's deliberately simple style somehow turns it into a comforting doctrine.  And that's the final reason you have to read the introduction. In it, as I said, he describes how he came to write \"Slaughterhouse-Five\".  Briefly, he wrote it in this particular manner at least in part because of the wife of his old Army buddy, a man who had lived through the bombing of Dresden with Vonnegut.  This woman worried that Vonnegut would make war sound like fun, and thus make children like hers want to go out and fight and die.  She needn't have worried - I can assure you there is nothing fun about war as presented here, although it is kind of amusing when Billy encounters a couple of characters from Vonnegut's previous books.  The important point, though, is that the author structured his book to not only claim, but demonstrate, that nothing is ever lost. One way he did this, and the most obvious, comes at the introduction's end, where he points out that \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" begins with the line \"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time\" and ends with the line \"Poot-tee-weet?\"  That's his transcription of bird song, a sound Billy hears at a rather horrible moment.  The sound reminds him once again that no matter how dreadful life can get, the birds still sing, and their song, like everything else, is never lost. So in his introduction, Vonnegut brings the opening and closing of his novel together and shows us what it can teach us.  And now that you know that, you still have to read the introduction.  You have to read the novel, too, because there's more in it than just that.  I'll let you find it for yourself.  I'll tell you one thing, though; Vonnegut was a master prose stylist, and in \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" he found a style that matched his theme just about perfectly.  And that's rare enough that I can't allow you to miss it.  So what are you waiting for?  Go read it! Benshlomo says, Every word from the mouths of the wise is like gold.",

         "I have a very good friend. He is an intellectual and an alcoholic. My dad was an alcoholic but not an intellectual. I drink myself and have had a good many in depth discussions with many a drunken barroom philosopher. My old pal, the intellectual, and I have spent numerous evenings discussing \"life, love, the here-and-now and the forever after\" over a jug of wine or scotch and a big plate of ham and cheese. Oftentimes my old buddy would turn on the tape recorder and record our meanderings. In the days afterward, he would listen to them over and over - even without a bottle of scotch by his side. One day I asked him why in the name of heaven he was recording all our drunken babbling. He said, \"Some day I am going to put it all together and publish it as a Kurt Vonnegut novel.\" Reading Slaughter-house Five has been my first experience with Kurt Vonnegut and I must say my old buddy has a pretty good idea. Kurt admits to being a drinker in this book and calling friends on the phone late in the evening ... and babbling. I know nothing more about Kurt and his life than what I have read in this one short volume. But this book does remind me of many a bar-stool conversation that I have had in my lifetime. I sit down at my stool and the fellow next to me, Kurt Vonnegut, begins to expound. He smiles, laughs often and sucks me into his monologue. He begins light and airy but with a humorous gravity. A few minutes into his spontaneous dissertation, he lowers his head to the bar and goes to sleep. Ten minutes later, the bartender slaps his hand on the bar and Kurt wakes up. He immediately starts talking about his days as a prisoner of war in World War II. He talks for about five minutes and then his head collapses to the bar once again. When he awakes this time he has just been kidnapped by Martians. He talks about this experience for a moment or two but then slips off into the fog once again. Life goes on ... \"and so it goes\" until Kurt pops up again. This time he talks of his pal who didn't make it back from the war and somehow we slip into his wife and her current cancer treatments and then we go back to the slaughter-house where he and a few buddies were being held as prisoners during the bombing in Dresden, Germany in World War II. The next time he wakes up we are into his oldest son and the fist fight they had when the boy turned 22 and then we are off and into his third wife and her bouts with depression. Kurt wanders in and out of consciousness. He makes you laugh, he chocks you up and he changes the topic as soon as he thinks he could be losing you. His story has no beginning, middle or end. It is a feel-as-you-go type thing - spontaneous, quick-witted, personal, witty and emotional. And, like Mark Twain, he challenges the reader to find a plot. But yet you find yourself very entertained. And when you get up from your stool, you toss a few bucks onto the bar and tell the bartender to give Kurt a drink or two on you ... when he wakes up again. \"You know,\" you comment to the bartender before leaving, \"every barroom needs a guy like this. You got to keep this guy around.\" The bartender laughs. Kurt admits that he did not want to write about this subject and for much of the book he doesn't. It reads as if he wrote it with a bottle of scotch or bourbon by his typewriter. As the bottle empties the monologue becomes more intense, more emotional and more dramatic. The trick here is like with Mark Twain himself. Mark Twain was a \"rambler\" but he was also a serious writer. His rambling were planned and thought out and agonized over. I believe Kurt is of the same character. Contrary to intended appearances, he's not babbling and he is not drunk. He is writing, composing, creating. He is capturing his reader with variety and inventiveness. He has created a character of himself. He is definitely a \"different\" type writer. He has a style and a personality and it shows. He's good. Cheers Kurt. The stool next to me is always open. I will be reading more of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. I have a big stack of his books out in my poor man's library in a shed in my backyard. Poor Kurt has been sitting out there by himself for a number of years. I will have to join him more often in my future; I'll bring a bottle of something special along.

         "Apart from having seen the film adaption of \"Stardust,\" this is the first book by Neil Gaiman I've ever read. I just finished it yesterday. I had attempted to read this book a couple of years ago, purchasing the original version. I think I made it as far as the prostitute swallowing a man with her vagina and didn't connect with it. For some reason, it wasn't time for me to read the book. Now, we have this wonderfully affordable paperback version of the author's preferred text, and me being the absolutist that I am, felt more inclined to make the attempt again more recently, knowing I was getting the full experience. Furthermore, this book had a way of coming back to me over and over again over the last couple of years; people I knew were reading it, they TV series is coming out soon, and other such references that made it clear that my intuition was urging me to come back to this story. The final message was seeing an ad for Neil Gaiman himself coming to San Diego for a talk recently, so, my resistance having been worn down, I went and bought the book. I am so glad that I did. This is easily one of the best fiction books I have ever read. It was thoroughly enjoyable from first page to last. This time I went in knowing everything would not make sense up front, and there would be strange and otherworldly happenings that I would have to go with until things became more clear throughout the book. As with many things, the timing was right and this was the perfect book for me at this time. The theme of old Gods living among us on the fringeremnants of the manifested idols and archetypes brought to America by immigrants through the years, now scraping a living as the downtrodden and grifters of the world once the cultures and beliefs assimilate or waneis an extremely interesting and fascinating idea. Add to that the notion that their meager way of life is now being threatened by the rise of new Gods, less traditional, more technical and topical, albeit less respectful and more ruthless, and you get a very fascinating, entertaining, humorous, mystical and quite simply beautifully written story full of all types of historical and mythological tidbits that reveal the author's extensive base of knowledge and interest. The character of Wednesday is one of the best characters in literature I've read, and I fell in love with him immediately. I laughed out loud many times while reading this book, most of the time because of something Wednesday said, although there were moments with other characters that were hilarious as well. I won't give away his true identity for new readers, but will say this version of the god would be a lot more fun to spend time with and from whom to hear stories than many other, perhaps more mythologically appropriate renditions. I was not put off by the \"horror\" aspects of this story, and while it went to some dark places and had elements of Stephen King-like gruesomeness, it was written with a certain kind of detachment that made it seem less visceral or effectual in an unsettling way, simply presented as another aspect of life in this crazy and strange world. The violence was not presented in a sensational way, in other words. Gaiman is more interested in taking the reader on a mystical, magical, mythological and spiritual journey, challenging beliefs and myths and exposing some hard truths about human life, than he is in shocking the reader through overly gruesome descriptions of the macabre. I really respect that. Although this book was written at the turn of the century, it is as topical, if not more so, now than ever and I believe we are witnessing a deconstruction of beliefs and a shifting of paradigms now more than ever, so this book is a wonderfully cathartic and entertaining way to process a lot of the raw emotion and confusion that we are experiencing right now. I certainly found it helpful in that regard. My only criticism is the fact that the book isn't longer. I think the story would have benefited from more time spent with the \"new gods,\" fleshing out their characteristics and motivations a bit more, although part of the point is that they are more mechanical, synthetic and hollow than the old gods, so giving them less room to develop and highlighting their precision and emotionless nature is perhaps the better choice. Gaiman certainly did a fine job presenting them as distorted and debased, characters who mock, defame, trivialize or insult some of the most hallowed and sacred subjects or experiences as a means of pure amusement. Still, there are certain characters I would have been happy to spend more time with, and the opposition could have used a bit more \"screen time\" as it were, to raise the stakes a bit. On the whole, however, the book is masterful and delightful and very relevant, and I can not recommend it highly enough.",

I loved all of the characters, even the ones I should have disliked, I loved, because the writer did so well developing even the most minor characters. After discovering that this book was set in Detroit, I rushed out and bought it the same day it was released. I was excited about the book because it seemed unique.

I understood the mother with all of her faults, and I appreciated JD the father and his love for his child. If you're looking for a lot of drama, you won't find it in this book, but there is a hint of mystery involving JD, Rae, and JD's stepdaughter Kimmie that will keep you guessing until the very end. Also, the book was set in the 70's and the writer did an excellent job of placing the reader in that era. Similar to listening to an old song that triggers memories, this book did the same for me as I was a young child who grew up in Detroit in the 70's.

Wonderfully written and beautifully realized, it is captivating from start to finish. It is the early 1960s, and Madeleine McCarthy's Canadian Air Force family is moving back to a base in Ontario after being posted in Germany. MacDonald lovingly paints a rich portrait of the rituals and traditions of families who move every three years--the neighbors, the welcome barbeques, the women who automatically greet new arrivals with enough food to see the new family through the unpacking stage, the kids who relish the anticipation of finding a  new best friend. MacDonald takes time setting this all up. It is so friendly, so happy, that something must be wrong, but what? Pay attention, because she is planting little mines all over the place, and they will explode. Madeline's loving French-Canadian mother, her adored dad, her kind older brother, are created with such love that they break your heart. The early sixties are a character in themselves, a time when WWII was a fresh memory and the cold war was a fact of life. Scientists were being smuggled out of the East to spill their secrets to the West. We talk about the Bay of Pigs in an abstract fashion today, forgetting how terrifying it was at the time and how it effected the psyches of  everyone who lived through it. \"The Way the Crow Flies\"  is certainly one of my favorite books so far this year. It hiccups once the life of the adult Madeleine takes stage, but does that take away from the affect of this novel? No. Ann-Marie McDonald is a sweet, tough writer.

While Gerber does present an intersting and inciteful idea that many businesses fail because there is lack of proper balance between the tecnician, the manager and the entrepreneur, he then goes away from this theme and recommends that all new companies should have a process that is detailed enough so your comapny can run without you.  He continues to emphasise and recommend this franchise type of business model.  He suggests that this will allow a new owner to hire those with no expertise in the product and to rely on the process itself to run the business. While franchises certainly offer a valid business model, to promote this way of business simply as a way to avoid the need to find and hire employees and managers with knowledge of your industry is simply ludicrous. He continues to return to a ficticious dialogue between him and a small business owner that i found simpy unrealistic and downright insulting. The impropper use of quotation marks as well as the capitalization of The Technician, The Manager and The Entrepreneur were quite annoying as well.  His editor(s) must have been those who were following an \"operations manual\" and had no experience in editing a book. I also question the length.

Evans, therefore, obviously is comfortable with some of the allegations that he makes here.  Nobody who reads this book ever will feel the same about any of the primary cast of characters. President Kennedy reads almost like a sexual pervert and, according to Evans, his wife may have defined the concept of the \"Merry Widow.\" Her sister, Lee Radziwell, comes over as even more ungrounded than Jackie was in conventional morality regarding adultery--and this is being polite.  According to Evans, Marilyn Monroe sounds anything but simple, and Robert Kennedy appears almost venal. Evans casts doubt on everything including the motivation behind Jackie's pregnancies and those of Ethel Kennedy, considering them to be largely political tools contrived by the husbands. This seems hard to believe.  The person who comes across worst is Aristotle Onassis. Among the other assertions in this book, it is claimed that Onassis originally had been a homosexual and that the basis of his fortune had come from drug smuggling.  The kicker is that Evans states that Onassis had arranged for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, his \"nememis\" of the title, by Arabic terrorists.  NEMESIS makes for gripping reading, one of those books that prove impossible to put down until the very last page.",

         5,
         "I don't care who you are, you absolutely need to read this book. It's justly considered a classic. The thing about it is that it isn't really a \"humor book\" like some of Vonnegut's other, justly famous works (Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater). Parts of it are funny - I especially like the segments with the bitter Kilgore Trout, a sci-fi author reputed to be one of the worst ever - but humor isn't the focus of this book. Rather, it focuses on creativity and a solid message. Most if not all of Kurt's work is topical to some extent, but here his message comes to the fore. Vonnegut's view of time here is fascinating. Rather than present it as a straight line, as most other authors do, he explores its more abstract natures. To him, time is not a line, but a complex network of points that anybody at any time can travel arbitrarily amongst. This is prime creativity. Some of the most memorable segments of the book involve hapless hero Billy Pilgrim becoming \"unstuck in time.\" The first time he describes it, he takes a beautiful, \"poetic-prose\" approach. He floats freely through ideas, ideas that intentionally don't connect but are still beautifully written. Billy actually experiences both his birth and his death over the course of the book. But here is the REAL reason why you need to read Slaughterhouse-Five. It's very much an anti-war book, and the central message it communicates is that there are no heroes in war. The war Vonnegut focuses on is World War II, specifically the Allies' firebombing of Dredsen, Germany, an event that killed more people than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's clear that Vonnegut holds Nazi Germany in the utmost of contempt. But he also makes the claim that the Allies were not flawless, wonderful supermen. It's obvious that he believes in their ideals, but he also argues that they could be just as bad as their enemies. After all, countless German civilians were killed during the Dredsen firebomings, and I'm going to guess most of them had nothing to do with the Axis powers. In today's world, in today's wars, things aren't so black-and-white, and I think our President desperately needs a reminder of that. This conviction of his that America is the heroic cowboy, shooting down them no-good varmints with a gun in every holster, then mounting his horse and riding off into the sunset, is simply delusional. Don't get me wrong, I have as much if not more hatred for the terrorists our soon-to-be-ex-President (hopefully to be replaced by Barack Obama, but that's irrelevant) is so staunchly opposed to. They certainly are psychopaths, and the world would be a better place without them. But I can at least see where they're coming from. After all, hasn't America stolen their culture with its obsession with a globalist economy? There are no clear-cut heroes or villains in this war. Both sides have understandable motives, and while I admittedly side with the U.S. on this matter (though the Iraq War is at least as unnecessary as the Vietnam War, and has arguably done more damage to our country's reputation), the terrorists do have a point, I suppose. And that's why you need to read this book. Because war isn't as simple and clear-cut as certain presidents would like to believe it is. This is a fine example of preaching to the choir, since I'm a pacifist (except in extreme cases, like World War II), but I simply love this book on many, many levels. Vonnegut's masterpiece. If you wanted proof that he was an author of real literary merit and not just some weirdo - though if that's the case, you can't be my friend - this is a sure bet.",

         5,
         "Following \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" Kurt Vonnegut swore off novels. In the introduction to his 1970 play, \"Happy Birthday, Wanda June,\" Vonnegut quotes himself: \"I'm left-handed now, and I'm through with Novels. I'm writing a play. It's plays from now on.\" Thankfully he didn't keep this promise. \"Breakfast of Champions\" appeared a mere three years later. An eye blink in time. Maybe Vonnegut thought he couldn't outdo his 1969 masterpiece? His Everest was conquered, so to say. Understandable, because \"Slaughterhouse Five\" remains his most quoted, chatted about, and revered book. And though it fits square-peg square-hole right into his body of work, he never wrote anything else quite like it. Next year it  turns 40. It has had a difficult life. Some potty-mouthed irreverent language made it anathema to didactic schoolmarms and the straight-laced. But controversy usually bites back, and the book entered the national spotlight. Censorship has always fueled sales. Even back then. Business 101. \"Slaughterhouse Five\" tells the story of a secular messiah optometrist, Billy Pilgrim. Like Vonnegut, who appears as the \"I\" and \"me\" throughout  the book, Pilgrim was in a bomb shelter when Allied forces firebombed the cultural haven of Dresden to absolute smithereens. Historical descriptions are ghastly. Though the German government later revised the initial estimates of 135,000 dead to around 35,000, it remains a brutal massacre nonetheless. Pilgrim comes to Dresden via the Battle of the Bulge where he and his companions are captured and shipped in miserable rail cars to a prison camp. There, proud and hearty British officers feed and entertain them until the Nazis transfer Pilgrim's unit to Dresden as laborers. Once there, they sleep in \"Schlachthof-fnf,\" or \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" where meat was once processed. Soon after, the city gets drenched in flames as the prisoners sit helplessly in subterranean bomb shelters. Horror awaits them when they emerge. Dresden now looks like the surface of the moon. Though Dresden's destruction undoubtedly provided the inspiration for Vonnegut's magnum opus, the story focuses more on the life of Pilgrim and his revelations on temporality. But being a \"witness\" to Dresden carries far-reaching implications. And there is nothing linear about this narrative or its implications. It begins, famously, with the line \"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\" Like Christ, on who he's loosely modeled (hints abound throughout the text, though this is by no means a religious book), Pilgrim has \"good news\" for humanity. Good news about time and the impact of death. We've been wrong all along, it turns out. After surviving Dresden, becoming a rich and successful optometrist, Pilgrim gets abducted by aliens in 1967. They take him 446,120,000,000,000,000 miles from earth. There he becomes the center of attention, the supposed \"perfect specimen\" of humanity. Even his urinating causes cheering. In short, he's in an alien zoo. These aliens, known as Tralfamadorians, give Pilgrim a new view of time. Time isn't linear, they tell him. It's total. Every moment has always existed and always will exist. So we live forever. On top of that, in the zoo Pilgrim gets to mate with a human hottie: Montana Wildhack (as opposed to Valencia, the unattractive woman he marries for money and stability). All of his dreams come true. He no longer fears death (presented as violet light and a hum). He's free, and he wants to tell the world. Of course humanity, including his own daughter, consider him nuts. Pilgrim has internalized this philosophy of time, and he jumps from one episode of his life to another, seemingly at random. Only Kilgore Trout seems to understand. Pilgrim's view of time provides the novel's main tension and theme: the old hoary question of free will and determinism. The Tralfamadorians are deep determinisists. In fact, Earth represents the only planet they know of where talk of \"free will\" occurs. They provide the mouthpiece for one of Vonnegut's most poignant lines: \"Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.\" Such passages have led to debates concerning the novel's view of free will. Was Vonnegut denying free will? Does he think we have any control over our destiny? The novel doesn't take sides. Instead, it presents a middle path in the form of a brilliant Vonnegut cartoon. A locket hangs between two potato shaped breasts - Montana Wildhack's breasts. It reads: \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.\" So are we free or determined? Both. The most important thing humans can do is know the limits of our powers. Some things we can change, other things we cannot. With this masterstroke, Vonnegut also helps redeem the often disparaged medium of cartoons. Finally, no discussion of \"Slaughterhouse Five\" can ignore the book's most ubiquitous phrase: \"So it goes.\" Vonnegut inserts this laconic quip whenever a death occurs. Some have interpreted this move as making light of or as dismissing the impact of mortality. But this repetitive leitmotif can also produce the opposite effect: it can magnify death's impact by simple repetition. After finishing the book, \"So it goes\" will likely linger in the head for days. Though \"so it goes\" represents and calls attention to death, it nonetheless reads as humor, but as \"naughty humor\" evoking hesitant or guilty laughter. Many critics have described Vonnegut's work as a perfect combination of funny and sad. This aptly describes the effect of \"So it goes.\" Likely \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" a deceptively easy read, will stand as Vonnegut's major work as long as people continue to read twentieth century literature. Sadly, Vonnegut passed away in 2007. One is tempted to say \"so it goes,\" but unaccompanied by laughter. All one can say is thanks for this book, Kurt, and everything else.",

         "I tackled this book shortly after reading MacDonald's award-winning bestseller, FALL ON YOUR KNEES, which both my wife and I simply devoured, albeit a dozen years after its publication and international success. That book topped 500 pages, and this one, THE WAY THE CROW FLIES, went over 800 pages! Even so, I managed to get through it in just over two weeks, even with some minor heart surgery thrown in somewhere in the middle of it. This book has probably already had reams of reactions written, so there's probably not much original that I could add. It is, quite simply, 'unputdownable' (is that a word?). This book has something for everyone. I was originally intrigued by reading that the core sequence of events took place around the time of the Cuban Missile crisis in October of 1962. During that pivotal moment in Cold War history I was not quite halfway through army basic training in Ft Leonard Wood, Missouri. As trainees, we had very limited access to media reports of what was happening, but we could, I remember, feel a palpable tension emanating from our drill instructors and cadre, an unsettling sense of urgency about what they were doing - training us! MacDonald's protagonists in TWTCF are a young family in the Royal Canadian Air Force (the RCAF no longer exists), the McCarthys. The father, Jack, is a WWII veteran and a senior officer at a training base in Centralia, Ontario. They have just been transferred there from Germany. Jack and Mimi (an Acadian beauty) have two children, Mike (Michel) and Madeline, who are twelve and eight when the story opens. Although MacDonald offers multiple points of view in the course of this mammoth epic, Madeline is the main focus of the story, with Jack running a close second. Jack's big disappointment in life was a flight training accident he suffered during the war, when he was just 18, which impaired his vision, making him unsuitable for flying status. Ever after he \"flew a desk\" as a support officer. That partial 'blindness' plays an important symbolic part of the narrative, as he is chronically unable to see what is happening to his children, or to properly see \"the small picture\" in his constant striving to understand the \"big picture\" of Cold War conflicts and intrigues in which he is naively embroiled, things which nearly destroy him in the end. MacDonald is a writer of prodigious talent, mixing dark fairy tale symbolism with comical samples of pop culture and humor, and that comic relief is very necessary in this disturbing and increasingly dark story of pedophiles, political intrigue and entrapment. The author has obviously done her homework. I learned more about that aforementioned Cuban Missile crisis and also about the U.S. missile program and space race between the U.S. and the USSR from this book than I could ever have imagined. There is much here too about the sinister involvement of former Nazis and war criminals in that missile and space development program - on both sides of the Iron Curtain. (A selected bibliography is appended at the end of the novel.) The darkest part of the plot, however, is found in the lives of the little girls of the story, Madeline and her classmates (and they come alive in ways that fiction has seldom succeeded in the past), and the vile ways in which they are victimized by an unscrupulous pedophile, practically under the noses of the children's unsuspecting and preoccupied parents. This sexual abuse has far-ranging ripples and repercussions which will haunt these kids - and their parents - for the rest of their lives, as is represented in the continuing story of Madeline McCarthy and her family over the next couple of decades. I wonder how many people are frightened away from a book like TWTCF by its very 'heft.' I pity those readers who are. Because what MacDonald has wrought here is a simply stunningly beautiful book - primarily about human relationships and families. And she has placed it into an historical and cultural context that makes it all the more believable and effective. I can't understand how she managed to keep all those balls in the air, and how she made it all seem so effortless, so real, and so darkly beautiful. If you love good writing and a good story, I entreat you - read this book! - Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir BOOKLOVER",

         "Shelby Steele's book is not an easy read. Don't let the apparent brevity fool you; this book could have just as easily been a decidedly heavy handed article in a scholarly journal on sociology or political science. There are many sections that are intellectually challenging. Yet at the same time, Steele makes the subject matter accessible to all. And frankly, there will likely be many people (typically the white liberals and blacks criticized within) who will be aghast at his thesis. Just as disconcerting though are the white conservatives who will grab onto this book as a \"see, I told you so\" moment. Neither side of this debate should jump to any conclusions regarding the content. It simply is a starting point; certainly not a definitive analysis. Steele does attempt to soften the tone by overlaying the material onto his metaphorical journey along California Highway 101. As Mark Twain did with Huck Finn, Steele's journey is a symbolic epiphany as he recognizes that America of his 1950s childhood is as foreign to the 21st century as 1776 is to modern Constitutional scholarship. He intersperses anecdotes from his childhood with his  \"coming of age\" in the 1960s. During these passages, we get a glimpse as to how Steele, in a rejection of \"groupthink\" and \"victimhood\" , ascends to a different point of view. This book is not for those who allow Limbaugh and O'Reilly, or Franken and Moore, tell them what to think. This book is for those who are significantly discriminating and open minded to accept it for what it is.",

         "Shelby Steele is a black conservative who thinks that modern liberalism is motivated by \"white guilt\", which is the need white people feel to absolve themselves of racism, and to be seen as anti-racist.  He thinks that the upheavals of the 60's were made possible by white guilt, which weakened the authority of the older people who had accepted overt racism. He especially criticizes race-based preferences in higher education.  He thinks the real purpose of affirmative action is so that the institution can dissociate themselves from the racist past by having a racially diverse student body - that they aren't interested in the actual effect of their policies on the black people they're supposedly trying to help.  He thinks affirmative action is an insult to black people, implying they can't make it on their own.  He points to black excellence in music and sports, to show that racism doesn't have to limit black people. Race-based discrimination in affirmative action is indeed ugly and often unfair.  Rich black students probably don't need it, and there are many students who have had severe disadvantages who aren't helped by affirmative action.  It's also currently unpopular, even among black people.  A 2016 Gallup poll found that only about 43% of black people thought race/ethnicity should be a factor in college admissions.  So perhaps race-based preferences are perceived as insulting and damaging by many black people, not just Shelby Steele. Some institutions only practice affirmative action in the sense of doing special outreach to under-represented groups, without lowering admissions standards for them.  This doesn't seem offensive, and it's much more popular. Better than race-based preferences would be to remove barriers to black people doing their best.  Steele doesn't believe that black people are still oppressed, but that's an extreme minority view.  And he doesn't give suggestions to improve the situation of blacks, except to end the \"soft bigotry of low expectations\". But in a 2017 poll, 92% of black people think there's still discrimination against blacks in the USA.  And research shows they're right.  Many people are still prejudiced against blacks and discriminate against them. Many liberal and libertarian ideas would help disadvantaged people, including black people, without explicitly discriminating in favor of blacks. Access to abortion and birth control helps women stay out of poverty.  Shelby Steele is in favor of abortion rights - good for him! Restricting gun ownership similar to how Germany does it, would help impoverished areas by making them safer and less stressful to live in, and also more enticing places to locate a business, since it would be less likely to get robbed.  Many Germans own guns, yet Germany has only 2% of the gun homicide rate that we do in the USA.  In Germany, people are carefully screened and  have to pass a knowledge test in order to obtain a gun license;  they have to actually need a gun for some purpose other than self-defense, such as hunting, collecting guns, competitive marksmanship, or for their job;  semiautomatic weapons are strictly limited; and the authorities can check gun owners' property to make sure the guns are being safely stored. Legalizing consensual crimes such as drug use and prostitution would also reduce gun violence in impoverished areas.  And it would end the \"criminal track\" that sends so many disadvantaged young black men to prison, to serve long sentences. Making good healthcare available to everyone regardless of their income also helps the disadvantaged.  Conservatives like Steele want people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, but that's often not possible if you're chronically ill.  Or uninsurable, and you get swamped with medical bills. Steele touts \"compassionate conservatism\" as helpful, but it doesn't seem to have come to much.  Trump promised to help disadvantaged people, but in reality his attempted changes have favored the rich. Steele also describes the intense \"political correctness\" that he experienced in a college English department.  He describes white academic leftists using white guilt to manipulate others.  It's easy to imagine intense jockeying for power among academics, rationalized as caring for minorities.  In that environment, the distortions of political correctness were exaggerated.  He says that standards for excellence in writing were abandoned in favor of ethnic literature courses that included mediocre writing, in order to make the whites who suggested them look good and make up for their own mediocrity. But he wouldn't have experienced any of that in the physics or biology departments.  Nobody advocates \"ethnic physics\" courses. That \"politically correct\" mentality was prevalent in the larger society as well, in a less concentrated form.  And it has led to problems that Shelby Steele doesn't discuss. White shame, for example, is very toxic to interactions between black and white people.  When white people are afraid of being accused of racism, they are constrained and tense around black people, don't see them as people, treat them with stiff politeness.  And because of their anxiety and tension, they avoid social interaction with blacks and avoid hiring them.  Which causes a vicious circle and generates racism:  tension around blacks causes whites to discriminate against them, which makes black people resentful, which causes whites to perceive black people as angry and scary, which makes them more tense ...  Most of the actual shaming is done by white people to other white people. Steele does discuss \"white blindness\" - the tendency that whites have to not see the black person there, only their own concerns.  But not white shame and the way it actually generates racism. \"White Guilt\" is perhaps dated in the time of Trump.  A lot of whites don't seem to feel shame about their racism, nowadays.  Perhaps the lessening of white guilt will ultimately be good for both black and white people. Shelby Steele is often accused of being in denial about the racism that still exists.  But he doesn't seem like that in \"White Guilt\".  He describes blatant racial discrimination that he experienced.  His attitude seems to be more \"Yes, there's racism, but so what?  Work hard at what you love and you'll become excellent and have your own life.  I did it, you can too!\".  Maybe he's wrong about that - he's a gifted person, not an average black man.  But it's refreshing after all the talk about black victimization. He believes that black people will have to uplift themselves; he says no oppressed group has ever been uplifted from the outside.  That's likely true.  But a lot can be done to get out of black people's way, by enacting the kind of liberal/libertarian reforms described above.  And Shelby Steele as a conservative may be opposed to much of that.",

         "This is a superbly wtitten and well argued book that views the impact of the sixties from a vanatge point that is often occluded by the almost universal excitement, attention, and interest that surrounds an intense time in American life--and is made problematic by the din of much generational noise trying to make sense of what was happening in American society and on the college campus.   As a New York City baby boomer who came of age at the time I have been following the differing interpretations of what this may have meant for many of us. Steele's informal (yet informative) sytle is very refreshing. I have also been at a loss to understand or explain what I would call \"tyrannies of the left\", namely, much of the misguided cant and shoddy scholarship that seems to be the standard fare in many college English departments. My particular gripe is how so many well intended people basically destroyed the CUNY system.   Once the hope of many who, like myself, couldn't afford higher education in the private \"free market\" but who knew that, with good grades and hard work, there was a place that offerred world class teaching and opportinities absent the requirement of tuition. It was once the crown jewel of \"The Big Apple.\" No more. Open admissions and escalating fees have basically gutted what it once meant to have have access to a genuine higher education via meritocracy.  Faculty were first rate and the students were among the brightest in the city.   Alas, the English department also has a right wing. My first exposure to this creature. Since I share Professor Shelby's concerns over what might be called \"curricular rot\", i.e., non-academic offerings posing as the genuine article, the politicization of damn near everything and, in general, the obscenely priced extension of high school that now passes for \"college\", I read his book with much interest. Sadly, it was a letdown of the highest order. His explanatory variable is \"White Gulit\": a new adventure in metaphysics.   The appeal of this concept is that it is a seductive illusion. Tantalizing, but impossible to operationalize and serving as a magic catch-all for whatever seems to trouble you. Like \"black invisibility\", its more irritating cousin, it clearly generates discomfort but is impossible to nail down because \"black\" and \"white\" are simply code words for very complex social realities. The drama they conceal is universal: What is the proper relation between freedom, the individual, and the state? Who benefits from this dialogue? The social sciences deal directly with these issues but neither a proper understanding a full formulation are available as slogans or suitable for bumper stickers.   It is not clear to me what Professor Shelby (as a \"black conservative\"--a term he clearly dislikes, yet champions) wishes to conserve. Before World War II , and absent the dissent of the sixties, the American higher education system did what all such system do: preserve class privilege for those who are favored. We have come full circle: college can now cost the price of a house.   Serious stuff. Solutions, however, will not be forthcoming from the English depaertment. Its left wing is currently enamored of French philosophers, and its right seems to be fixated on racial stereotypes. I'll leave it to the psychologists to figure out if Shelby' concerns fall within their purview. It used to be that when one studied college English one learned something of that subject matter and how to clearly express one's ideas. Oh, I forgot, that was in the \"decadent\" sixties when we all were less enlightened and were so foolish as to take our teachers seriously. I was never able to discern any political agenda in their course assignments where, I recall, the professors worked as hard grading them as we tried to muster the energy necessary to meet their expectations. Was that a dream? Was it a magic carpet suspended only by nostalgia? One never knows, after all, when looking back at the sixties.",

         "\"White Guilt\" by Shelby Steele is well worth your time. If you're wondering how race relations in this country have become so poisonous, Shelby Steele has a significant part of the answer. Here's how toxic race relations are in this country right now: it's significant (even though it should not be) that Shelby Steele is black. Steele describes how guilt-motivated bad behavior on the part of white people has enabled anger-motivated bad behavior by black militants (e.g. Al Sharpton), to the point that the \"conversation on race\" that everyone talks about is difficult-to-impossible. Black or white, if you say the wrong thing, you're in big trouble. I hope a lot of people read this book. It might help.

         "We first meet Shadow Moon as he is being released from prison three weeks early due to the tragic death of his wife. Not knowing what to do next, he is asked by a stranger if he wants a job. Shadow has no other options so he takes the job blindly. In Neil Gaiman's own words this is a release from prison, a road trip, and a corrupt town all balled into one big book. My biggest problem with this book is its sheer length. While parts of it are really good and engaging, drawing you right in, there are other parts that have so many useless facts that I felt really hard pressed to keep listening. Shadow is a very personable protagonist and even with his flaws you find yourself becoming increasingly fond of him and what he continues to go through. It helps that all the other characters are so vile that they make him shine in comparison. I can't get into the antagonist without really giving anything away. It really kept me guessing throughout the story. I think that's another one of this book's greatest points, it leaves you wondering just enough so that you keep reading even when you don't really want to. I gave this book a 4 out of 5. It is seriously bizarre and has some strong sexual content that may not be for everyone. I'm a fan of bizarre and at times it was even too out there for me. I've always heard amazing things about Neil Gaiman and this is the first book I've read by him and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. I may have started with the wrong book from his library. I will give another a try to see if my opinion improves. This was definitely not a bad book. I liked it. But I expected to be floored due to the reception he's received and I just wasn't floored by this and I will probably never read it again.

         "Please indulge me y'all.  I don't usually write long posts. I hate it when others do it consistently and I rarely read them. The reason I love Ms. Beverly historical romance novels, and what sets her apart, is that she is a student of African American history. She never fails to educate the reader.  She isn't a fluff writer. Yes there is erotica, but it is only a small part of the story. She drops some knowledge on you at the same time. We are reintroduced to Archer, Sable, Raimond, Cullen, the children, and the other LaVaq brothers. Archer LaVaq is the main male character in this continuing saga.  The primary female character is a Union operative (spy).  Her current assignment places her in New Orleans to play a high price Madame.  She opens a house of ill repute that caters to the monied men in New Orleans.  They figured that sex and alcohol make for loose tongues. I suggest for those who aren't in the know to please read Indigo and Through the Storm to familiarize yourselves with the cast of characters before venturing to this book, though each book stands alone. The time period that the characters are in is set towards the end of Reconstruction that ended in 1877.  Lieutenant Governor, Oscar Dunn, was a formidable Radical politician and he had many enemies. Archer and the other LaVaq brothers discussed Oscar Dunn and his sudden death.  It was an open secret that he was poisoned.  Here is an excerpt from a book I read \"Capital Men\" by Philip Dray.  If you read my review of this book by Mr. Dray, you will notice I am not a fan of this book or any of the author's works.  However, he did a good job with telling the story of Oscar Dunn.  So I can't deny him his due completely.  I took only a small section to share with y'all. Excerpt: In the midst of the crisis, in November 1871, Oscar Dunn came down with a nagging, Debilitating cough, a condition he and his friends assumed had resulted from his strenuous duties.  For about a month he had been suffering from what his doctor called \"pulmonary catarrh,\" a popular cure-all \"recommended for weak hearts.\"  The product, however, had been ineffectual in curing his weariness and hoarseness.  On Saturday, November 20, Dune gave a talk at the Third Ward Radical Club and was in good form.  Sunday morning he ate a hearty breakfast and spent the day with his cohort Marshal Packard.  After dinner, however, Dunn had a severe attack of vomiting, and on Monday, E.D. Beach, the family doctor, was called in.  Beach diagnosed pneumonia, noting that the lieutenant governor's brain was \"evidently much affected,\"  and put him to bed, in the care of a nurse.  During the night Dunn slipped into unconsciousness, and Packard was summoned.  Seeing his friend's desperate situation, he called in another physician, Dr. Scott, who declared that Dunn was suffering from congestion of the brain and lungs brought about by excessive vomiting. Other leading physicians of New Orleans arrived, including Dr. Warren Stone, a local medical pioneer, but they ventured no new diagnosis and expressed puzzlement at Dunn's rapid deterioration.  Consulting in hushed tones, they cast pitying looks at the patient's wife, who, along with other family members, had convened a deathwatch by the bed, where Dunn lay emitting \"a regular gurgling sob that occasionally changed to a harsh rattle.\"  Mrs. Dunn, alternately clutching a handkerchief and lowering her face into her hands, came and went, unable to remain for long in the presence of a scene so unbearable.  Dunn's nurse, observed that she had \"never seen pneumonia like that.\"  Gently wiping the drops of blood and mucus from Dunn's lips, she assured her patient that \"Jesus is coming - Jesus will soon be here to take you away.\"  At the sound of her voice, Dunn opened his eyes and appeared to scrutinize the woman's face, \"his blank stare mirroring the baffied confusion his soul.\"  \"They've given poison to the Governor,\" another servant said quietly.  \"They've poisoned the Governor.\"  Late Tuesday night, November 23, he slipped from consciousness for the last time, and soon one of the physicians signaled that the struggle had ended. When the local coroner, Dr. Creagh, he encountered a police physician, Dr. Avila, who was preparing to depart; Avila said that Dunn's family had turned him away.  At Creagh's urging, Avila returned with him to the house, where Creagh explained to Dunn's survivors that a rumor of the lieutenant governor's poisoning was already abroad on the streets, and it was Creagh's duty under law to conduct a postmortem to ascertain the true cause of death.  The family, supported by Beach and the other attending physicians, refused Creagh as had Avila, insisting that Dunn had died of natural causes.  They also rebuffed Cragh's request to examine a sample of Dunn's body waste, which might have helped confirm or dispel the suspicion of poising. Was Oscar Dunn poisoned?  His overall condition and specific symptoms- vomiting, muscle spasms, shrunken features and whitened face, weak pulse, coma - correspond with classic accounts of arsenic poisoning.  Because the symptoms arsenic causes resemble those of natural illness, and because, colorless and flavorless, it can be mixed undetectably with food, this poison was known as a handy means of retribution or a shortcut to an inheritance.  Certain arsenic compounds were used in the nineteenth century to treat syphilis, which might explain Dunn's family's demand for secrecy, although there is no evidence he suffered from the disease. O course, the theory that had \"set tongues upon swivels\" on the streets of New Orleans was that Dunn had been murdered for political reasons. Whether Dunn was poisoned, or his natural, if untimely, removal simply agitated local suspicion, what mattered was that a man who may have had a stabilizing effect on Reconstruction in Louisiana had been cut down in his prime. End Excerpt from Capitol Men Big Sistah Patty's Two Cents: I love all of Ms. Beverly historical novels.  They are a treat, and I am so happy I discovered her.

         "Except for the garish cover jacket, this is a devilishly well-written and well-presented book. True enough it is \"conspiracy fare,\" but with a flair: a la British style, where the conspiratorial plot is insinuated rather than unceremoniously stuffed down the reader's throat as uncontestable media-driven and \"state sanctioned\" fact. The strength of the book however is not the conspiratorial plot, which in my view is mostly a sideshow to the main event. Its power lies in the excellent writing that exposes the utter shallowness of the pseudo-royal and nuevo-monied jet-setters, as they go about their desperately empty lives, trying to pump meaning into them by way of extra-marital sex, alcohol and drugs, gaudiness, world-class treachery, lavish globe-trotting cruises and parties, and mindless spending for spending sake, in short, the worse sort of debauchery. There was a time when such decadent hubris, and money-based royalty was to be envied as the \"good life,\" but Peter Evan brings them and their phoniness back down to earth and it is not a pretty picture. When he finishes with them, using mostly their own words (as he very carefully mines most of his material from a host of their own memoirs), there is certainly very little left to envy about them. At the epicenter of the story are the two \"uber-egos\" of RFK and Ari Onassis, locked into battle for over a generation, and who, despite all their power and wealth retained the social minds of a couple of juvenile delinquents. Their respective struggles and feuds bordered on the psychopathic, more befitting a couple of teenage gang leaders than respected world-class \"prime movers.\" But this seemed not to have bothered either of them one iota, as they both continued obsessively committed to the utter destruction of the other. According to the author, the seminal event triggering the feud was Onassis' paranoid suspicions that it was RFK's hidden hand responsible for scuttling his carefully laid plans to corner the oil tanker shipping market, first in Saudi Arabia, then in Haiti. Likewise, Bobby was equally worried and paranoid that Onassis, would use his tight-knit social connections (within the Kennedy clan via Jackie's sister and eventually via Jackie herself) to find out and use what dirt he could uncover, against the Kennedys, thereby scuttling first JFK's chances of being re-elected, and then RFK's chances of becoming President after his brother's assassination. These mutual suspicions eventually spilled over into \"all out\" psychological warfare and reached a crescendo in the run up to Onassis determined efforts to marry Jackie, which he eventually did. But not before RFK first forbid it, then to avoid a scandal (since the whole world already knew Onassis was screwing Jackie), insisted on it. If you believe the author's version of the way events unfolded, RFK got the worse of this multi-decade series of vendettas that coalesced around JFK's widow's \"shotgun marriage\" to Onassis. What is insinuated (if only ever so lightly) is that Onassis, after marrying Jackie, used his Palestinian connections to pay for (though not set up)  the hit that ended in RFK's assassination. A la British style, one is of course expected to read between the lines and connect the dots for himself, which is fine if you are a non-American: this version then makes perfectly good sense. But if you live within U.S. borders, you can almost feel the other anti-RFK wheels grinding as they pre-position themselves (with Ari's 1.5-3.5 million dollars) to take advantage of the RFK-Onassis feud: And here we mean, LBJ/Hoover/Mob/Texas oil/CIA machinery, for instance. Just as Evan-Prichard's \"The Secret World of Bill Clinton,\" exposed the corruption surrounding Bill and Hilary Clinton, this book, written by another Englishman, attempts to tie up the loose ends surrounding the primal feud between Onassis and Bobby Kennedy. One does not need to be a conspiracy nut to enjoy a well-documented, well-told story, and this is it. Five stars",

         5,
         "This is a highly personal reflection on the part of Shelby Steele, literally conceived in a single drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco. White guilt, says Steele, had \"generated a new social morality that made racial prejudice utterly illegitimate.\" More important, according to Steele, white guilt makes \"the moral authority of whites and the legitimacy of American instituions contingent on proving a negative: that they are not racist.\"   While this was a unique achievement, it also opened the doors wide to hucksters who would exploit white guilt while doing nothing for the people who were supposed to be liberated.   In perhaps the most powerful chapter of the book, Steele uses a column about the dissenting opinion of Justice Clarence Thomas to make his point: white liberals, Steele says, feel that people like Thomas should show \"gratitude\" for affirmative action. As Steele puts it Dowd \"is trying to \"annihilate\" [Thomas] to put him in his place as an inferior who can advance only through the largesse of superiors like [Dowd].\" These words and the balance of this particular chapter are a scathing indictment of white liberals and white guilt.   Steele's \"White Guilt\" is a stunning document. He truly does establish how, as the subtitle puts it, blacks and whites together destroyed the promise of the civil rights era. Every thinking person concerned for the destiny of American society should read this book. Jerry",

         "Shelby Steele is deadly accurate with his assessment of the post Civil Rights environment.  This is the first book that I've read where the author provides cogent, concise, logical thought regarding this lingering social issue.  The highlight of the book is the way Steele brilliantly demonstrates how America was forced to reconcile the embedded acceptance of white supremacy with the articulated theme of a nation built on freedom and equality for all citizens throughout its history.  This conundrum, according to Steele, robbed America of its moral authority.  However, the manner in which white America dealt with this problem created a situation that is arguably far worse. The Civil Rights movement forced America to \"look into the mirror\" and clearly see the ugly image created by the ambiguity and hypocrisy of what it said versus how it treated its Black citizens.  Steele then illustrates how the guilt caused by this dilemma set off a chain of actions that effectively took America down a slippery slope that destroyed any chance of regaining moral authority.  Specifically, we find ourselves in an environment in which no white person is able to even insinuate that much of Black America's problems are of its own making.  To make such a statement will result in that person being labeled a racist.  Ironically, this lack of moral authority to point out inherent social weakness robs Black citizens of learning to adopt a positive attribute of white America.... i.e. the development of independence and economic success through hard work, rugged individualism and personal responsibility rather then depending on the government.  Steele points out very clearly that these government programs were largely established because of white guilt. Further, this lack of moral authority based on white guilt facilitates Black Americans' claim of perpetual Victimhood.  In fact, it helped to create the modern civil rights industry in which the so-called leaders hold America in perpetual hostage to its own guilt. This book is an absolute \"must read\" because it crystallizes these issues in clear and convincing detail.",

         "Shelby Steele, in his new book, White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era, expounds upon the mindset of both groups while exploring our nation's obsession with race. He outlines the interplay between white guilt and black power along with the pernicious effects this dynamic has upon both populations. The author grew up in a time when discrimination was not a shadowy thing. He witnessed it firsthand at baseball practice, and in his father's having to deal with the customs of the southern towns they'd visit. Throughout the text, Steele combines remembrance with observation as a means to elucidate interracial relations. He defines white guilt as being a complete vacuum of moral authority wherein a stigma is cast upon an entire group of people regardless of what they do or say. In the 1960s, it flourished in whites due to the very real historical wrongs of segregation and slavery. By the end of that decade, due to the growing passivity of whites, the black leadership no longer echoed Dr. King. They became radicalized, and there was no shortage of white politicians, intellectuals, and glitterati (recall Leonard Bernstein) ready to sprawl before their collective feet and regain their moral goodness. For many Caucasians, irrational hate for your own race and your ancestors has now become a mechanism for self-esteem and purity. When aggression meets submission the result is slaughter, and that's exactly what has happened to the pride of white America over the course of the last four decades. Rage has become the preferred weapon for obtaining concessions from white politicians, and shame prevents rational minds from protesting these tactics. Steele compares the state of many whites to that of Kafka's main character in The Trial, who is guilty of a crime solely because he has been accused. Black activists insisted that acquiring skills and education alone are not acceptable solutions; our government must actively raise them up. This demand is a reason why so many ashen faced elites embrace \"diversity\" and affirmative action. It allows them to acquire power while amassing feelings of personal superiority. The government internalized the stigma and dishonor of the majority population, and flooded black neighborhoods with lakes of redemptive spending. That the programs and grants issued were ineffective, or even made things worse, was largely irrelevant as the actions were designed to restore feelings of righteousness in politicians and their appointees. In the opinion of this reviewer, what keeps racial tensions high in America are intra-race conflicts as opposed to the interracial ones. Most likely, if one group of Caucasians discontinued the practice of systematically defaming all other Caucasians then the strains among us would diminish. The alchemizing of racism from discussions concerning taxation and personal choice does little more than poison our air. When blacks are free from the conspiracy theories and psychologizing of a power obsessed white elite, we will all get along much better. Ultimately, the best practice for individuals is to treat others as your equals. Modifying your speech and pretending strangers are sensitive to your every syllable is just absurd. The solution to racial problems is not to kow-tow to certain groups and apologize for crimes you never personally committed; instead, we should simply treat other people with respect no matter where they lie on the diversity flowchart. Skin color has nothing to do with personality or worth. Just as one can be certain that segregation and slavery occurred, one can also be certain that the Lester Maddoxes, Orval Faubuses, and Theodore Bilbos are long dead and will never rise again. It is now an excellent time to bury white guilt along with them.",

Critical to Gerber's thinking is that each business can be run similar to a franchise model - where the customer experience is consistent, the talent and skill required to run the business is minimized, and the approach is well documented and easily learned. The role of the owner is to view their business as a potential franchise, begin with the end in mind, and start building a business system that will deliver consistently for all stakeholders.

         "Vonnegut's SH5 deserves its place in the pantheon of great 20th century literature. It is one of the most moral books ever written. Easily at the top of his canon and likely, the only one of his works that will stand the test of time (although much of his work is great and relevant). Most people are familiar with the central character, Billy Pilgrim, and how he time travels back and forth, with the help of aliens, between his experiences in WWII (largely, the author's) and his comfortable suburban life in the 1960's. But, don't let this sci-fi device fool you into thinking the story is light hearted: its not. Vonnegut is a very eclectic writer who often uses various tricks and slights-of-hand to make a point, or sometimes, to structure an entire work. In this book, you can view Billy's time travel and his interactions with the aliens as metaphors for trauma. The parallels between some of those experiences and that of soldiers suffering 'shell shock' are very close. He also finds space to make some other points and philosophical musings. One that I found worthwhile was the aliens' ability to view life in its totality without being hindered by linear time. So, for example, if they view a dead man, they think that he's only in a bad way at that point in time, but in other points of time (which all co-exist simultaneously in their quantum perception), he's still doing fine. Some critics have used these musings to say that the novel lacks a moral vision. Or that Vonnegut is not taking grave things, like dying, seriously.  I disagree. I think these other perspectives show the author struggling with ways to make sense of a chaotic world. Much of which, he experienced first hand (as did Heller and JD Salinger, curiously). With the current hostilities which abound in the world, this book couldn't be more timely. It remains the best cautionary tale about war (with all due respect to \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"Catch 22\" and \"Red Badge of Courage\") and a great reminder of the horror and futility of unnecessary war acts. As a resident of the world's top military power, I'd say this book should be mandatory reading everywhere!",

In this story such a troop exists, complete with the players you'd expect: the character actor, the diva, the handsome lead, and the plethora of behind-the-scenes mice needed to run the show. Offstage drama--the sudden disappearance of Adelaide, the diva--puts the show in peril. Adelaide, thanks to her robust appetite, has been captured in a humane mouse trap. The young son of the theater's new owner hands the trap to a truck driver, who dumps it onto a snow bank in Brooklyn. Despite their grief at her loss, the cast agrees \"the show must go on.\" Hours outside the city, Adelaide is freezing--and facing her first obstacle in her journey back to the theater. She is saved from Scud, a thuggish rat, by Henry, a mousy professor who specializes in mouse lore. Henry (with other mice and unknowing humans) helps Adelaide to regain the stage in time for her big number. The cast and audience go wild, as they assumed they'd never see her again. A second story line involves Pippin, the junior assistant mouse, who helps to save the decayed theater from a wrecking ball. This tale bops along, never sagging. It is bolstered by Walton's delightful black-and-white illustrations, and a back glossary of theatrical terms.",

         "Joe Grey and the other talking cats of Molena Point, California, are suspicious when beautiful Chichi moves next door to Joe's person and starts making moves on him. Chichi had stolen five hundred dollars from him earlier--was she interested in stealing more now? Or did she have some other motive--one connected with the obsessive way she watched the Molena Point shops, taking notes on who left when, and what guards were available? Joe's life gets a lot more complicated when he learns that someone is trapping wild cats--specifically the wild cats that made up the pack (clowder) that Kit, one of the three Molena Point talking cats, had once belonged to. The Molena Point police are used to getting tips from unnamed informants who seem to observe things no human could observe, but this time, it's the cats who might need help from the cops, rather than the other way around. Because the thieves planning a major crime spree in Molena Point are the same criminals who are capturing sapient cats, planning on selling them for some television show or Hollywood movie. And they aren't going to limit themselves to just wild cats--Joe, Dulcie, and the Kit are targets as well. Author Shirley Rousseau Murphy delivers another of her charming talking-cats stories. Despite Chichi's interference, the romantic lives of the human characters are settling down. Charlie is newly married to Chief of Police Max Harper, and Clyde is dating Ryan. The lives of the cats are in more of a disarray. The Kit longs for the wildness of her youth, despite the attraction that human love offers--along with the human food she craves. Joe Gray and Dulcie feel a responsibility for the wild sapient cats who have been captured, and of course, the need to learn what secrets Chichi is hiding. Fans of this series will enjoy CAT BREAKING FREE. I don't recommend starting with this book if you're new to the series, though. Too much of the enjoyment comes from seeing how characters you've grown to love are adjusting to the happiness in their lives.",

When I read the book description, I was a bit uncertain that I would like this type of book with cats as characters that talk to each other and to some humans!  I was very much surprised when I got into this book. Joe Grey is one of these talking cats that has several other \"talking\" cats around him much of the time.  Of course these cats have to be very careful not to speak when other humans are near.  Only certain people they know well can know they talk.  These are not just \"cats\" but are real helpers in solving mysteries that occur in their small city of Molena Point, California.  The way they go about their helping the police will make you laugh, cry, and stay mystified until the last page. You WILL enjoy this book.  Do not be skeptical like I was.

Having said that, this book presents two very important concepts that bear repeating: 1) You can't (and shouldn't if you could) do it all. 2) A truly successful business must be able to run without the owner present. Mr. Gerber correctly points out the way to implement the latter is to preplan for growth and implement systems that are documented in a Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) manual that are simple enough for an entry level employee to follow. Easier said than done. Mr. Gerber doesn't address how the small business owner already working 70+ hours per week in his or her business is supposed to find the time to do the kind of detailed process workflow analysis required to produce such a document.  No matter that the need for doing so is evidently clear. Nor does Mr. Gerber address the obvious capital requirements necessary, even if one can find the time, to get the job done. Time is money and time and money are the two precious resources most small business owners have the least of.  This is a classic catch-22 situation where it's imperative that business owners systematize their operations but lack the resources to accomplish the task. Perhaps a great companion book for the author to write would be a meaningful blueprint for implementing the good advice found in E-Myth Revisited. Or perhaps the author could add a chapter or two to the existing book. Either way I give it four stars for not providing enough content to support an otherwise salient concept. It would also be helpful if his example business owner wasn't so docile and one dimensional. Joe Waynick, Author \"Internet Bookselling Made Easy!\" series [...]",

         "\"Slaughterhouse-Five\" was my first introduction to Kurt Vonnegut in the novel form.  I had read a few of his short stories and was already impressed with his status as a writer.  I would've never expected what I experienced when I read \"Slaughterhouse-Five.\"  It's hard to put into words that'll actually do this masterpiece the justice it deserves, but I will try. Listen:  Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.  This meaning that he relives certain moments of his life in random order like a scrambled movie.  He has absolutely no control over it whatsoever and he never knows what part of his life he'll have to reenact.  The majority of the moments that we witness take place during his involvement in WW2 as a POW and also when he is taken aboard an alien spaceship with creatures known as \"Tralfamadorians.\"  There is no ending for Billy Pilgrim.  He witnesses his beginning as well as death... and then the show starts all over again in a continuous loop throwing Pilgrim into random segments of his life. Reading this novel was a completely new experience to me.  I had never read anything like it, and now I know that I will never again read anything like it, as there is no way the book can be successfully duplicated by others.  Vonnegut is able to take a serious matter (such as war) and still throw in a balanced sense of humor that will take you by surprise.  The book pokes fun at just about anything you can imagine while still showing respect and care to the main subject matter.  The story is outrageously subtle and unpredictable.  This novel is a very easy read and once you begin it, you won't want to put it down until you have finished it.  Vonnegut is one talented writer with a very unique sense of style that I have never witnessed in any other book. One thing that people will probably dislike about the book is how confusing it can be at times.  Since the book jumps around and is not in order, you have to always be thinking and paying attention to every detail.  It's very easy to forget what has already happened and what has yet to happen since it is in scrambled order.  However, this is what really makes the book that much more special.  You'll want to reread it again for this very reason, as you'll most likely miss a few things with the first read.  It wasn't very hard for me to keep track of what was going on since I found the book to be so involving. While this is indeed a classic, because of the strange manner that the book is written in, it will most likely not appeal to everybody.  This is a risk-taking work of literature that is bound to not have everybody loving it.  Still, I think it's worth anybody's time to pick it up and give it a chance.  \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is a rare find that will keep you on your toes throughout the entire time.  You'll never know what to expect next.  A very touching, funny, sad and dark story about a flawed entity known as \"human-beings.\"  This has very quickly become a new favorite of mine, without question. -Michael Crane",

It reinforces the idea that being alone isn't some dread disease and it can be infinitely preferable to settling for a substandard relationship just to avoid loneliness.  As one knows, you can be more alone in a bad relationship than you ever could on your own!  I love the way it celebrates the enjoyable parts of solitude and encourages people to really know and like themselves before they try to do that for someone else.  Cool way to redefine our \"family\" units.  I love to see a group of people who really care about each other just because they do without the pressures of being everything for someone...which, we all know is impossible.

         "Entrepreneurs and people thinking about becoming entrepreneurs ought to read this book to gain perspective, not to find a magic bullet solution.  Gerber thinks all small businesses should operate with a franchise mentality; that is, basing the business on repeatable, profitable systems rather than on the personality of the owner. This is fine as far as it goes, but when Gerber puts all these elements of process (strategy, management, hr, marketing, sales, etc.) into a series of one-size-fits-all formulas, I think he is overreaching. Depending on a company's product/service, personnel, market, and a slew of other factors, these formulas may need quite an overhaul to fit the company's needs.  That said, the book is loaded with words of wisdom.  A few examples-- \"Adolescence begins at the point in the life of your business when you decide to get some help.\" \"To The Entrepreneur, the business is the product.\" \"It is literally impossible to produce a consistent result in a business that depends on extraordinary people.  No business can do it for long.  And no extraordinary business tries to!\" \"Most companies organize around personalities rather than functions.\" Some readers may discover a great deal about themselves as they read. Gerber says entrepreneurs have three mentalities--the entrepreneur, the manager, and the technician.  These mentalities are always in conflict, and the way in which the owner balances them determines the success or failure of the business.  If E-Myth helps owners figure out how to achieve a better balance, that insight will go further towards building the business than all Gerber's systems put together.",

Not everyone responds to a bad fundamentalist experience with the theological stances these authors do. Frankly, I think the stories within these two books are possibly better seen as the authors' biographies than as theological treatises on universalism. The books seem to me to lack a strong forensic or philosophical basis for their teaching; there are serious questions they could pursue in a way as to make their point less anecdotally and more qualitatively. Obviously viewing their work purely as anecdotal doesn't allow a reader to entirely circumvent the beliefs they advocate, but I think an approach from them that was biographic as to their own journey of faith would perhaps yield very similar books with what they hold out now as dogma being more tentatively held out as questions.",

         5,
         "The best word to describe this book is Excellent, capital E intentional. This book comes in a time of Vonnegut's writing career where he was both a great teacher and a great artist. This is a culmination of those teachings, put together in a uniquely artistic manner. The story is an anti-war exploration of the meaning of life. Rather, as the back covers proclaims, it is an odyssey through time. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, hops back and forth among his memories (in time) in an effort to put together the fractured reality which exists there. Along the way, Vonnegut creates resonances which make for superb reading. I don't think I overstate the case when I call it brilliant. Pilgrim, in this odyssey, finds that time does not proceed linearly, as we perceive it. Time merely is. If an event exists, it always exists since there is no past, present, nor future. Pilgrim learns this when he is abducted by aliens and taken to the planet Tralfamadore. Another tidbit he learns is that war is unavoidable. However, war doesn't exist in every moment in time, so the Tralfamadorians choose to visit those moments when there is no war. On one hand, this is an absurd statement for an anti-war book. If Pilgrim finds that war is inevitable, how are we to believe we can avoid situations like Dresden? I don't think this is Vonnegut's message, exactly. Tralfamadorians choose to spend their conscious time in moments when war isn't. Since we live linearly, we should likewise choose to exist in moments when there is no war. If we could, most of us would choose to spend our time in moments of peace. So perhaps war is inevitable, but we don't need to live through it right now. It's hard for me to imagine anyone who wouldn't like this book. I suppose if you were too young to understand, it may be unthrilling. Aside from that, you can assume that war hawks will dismiss it as gibberish, since Vonnegut does not portray war as glorious. As strange as it sounds, Vonnegut would probably call it gibberish too. An excellent book, even if it is gibberish.",

         "For a truly surreal reading experience, it doesn't get much better than Kurt Vonnegut's seminal science fiction/drama novel \"Slaughterhouse Five\".  Ostensibly an anti-war novel, \"Slaughterhouse Five\" transports the readers to many different places and times following the journey of the unimpressive Billy Pilgrim.  Billy is a sad, pathetic individual who seems to have spent almost all of his existence just mindlessly wandering from one station in life to the next without much enthusiasm for it or even much interest.  He's the kind of person that, if you saw him walking down the street or met him at a party, he would leave absolutely no impression.  Billy, like many in his generation, served in World War II.  The story (stories) of this novel center on the Dresden fire bombings in the last days of the war and his survival in an underground shelter, the aforementioned 'slaughterhouse five'.  He survived the war, went back home, became an optometrist, got married, and had a life with all the trappings of suburbia.  None of it really seems to matter to him, though.  He would have been content to die in WWII for he did not want to fight.  He was joke to those that served with him in a German POW camp.  Even in his own life back home, Billy wasn't much.  He married relatively unattractive woman because that's what people did.  His colleagues didn't have much respect for him, nor did his own children in later years.  So, what was Billy Pilgrim's purpose for existing?  He seemed to think it was to spread the message of an alien race about becoming 'unstuck in time'.   \"Slaughterhouse Five\" departs from any semblance of normal story-telling formats.  As Billy Pilgrim has become 'unstuck in time', he feels he exists in an environment where, instead of time being one chronological line, it is a series of points that exist concurrently and perpetually.  Billy falls asleep a widower and wakes up on his wedding day.  He may revisit his war experience or go back to childhood.  Billy journeys all over time because, where he's concerned, everything that has happened and will happen is all happening at the same time.  Perhaps it is the influence of the aliens that enable him to think this way, or perhaps Billy is really just suffering from severe post-traumatic stress following the Dresden bombing.  Either way, Billy is missing something in his life.  His journeys through time are his way to try and find meaning in a life where none exists.  It is a unique and existential journey for the reader and one definitely worth taking.  So it goes.",

Gerber, the founder of a consulting company for small businesses, had previously written one of my favorite business books: THE E-MYTH (short for entrepreneurial myth) . . . his basic premise is that just because you know the technical side of a business, you're not automatically going to be successful. But if you follow the model of many franchises--such as McDonald's--you can improve your chances . . . the key is to get a formula, then work that formula . . . all the time. I especially liked his advice on doing a little experiment if you run a retail store . . . ask the question that most people always ask when somebody enters your place of business, May I help you? . . . ask that for three weeks and track the results . . . then change the question to instead ask, Have you been here beforehand . . . when you track the results, you'll see that sales have increased 16%! That was just one of the many tidbits I gained from listening to this marvelous program; among the others: * Ask the question, What do you want to be? (As opposed to the question, What do I want to do?) * In a small business, 90% of your time should be spent on strategic work and only 10% on tactical work. Most businesses reverse these figures. * We don't have to motivate people, we need to inspire them. * Hire people by running ads not like anybody else; e.g., this one: We want people with passion, we want people with heart. When you get a bunch of people who are interested, bring them all at once in to a hiring seminar to listen to your story. At then end, then ask what one thing can they contribute to your organization. * Follow the example of Ritz Carlton, wherein any employee who gets a complaint owns it.",

He has been hanging out for quite some time around the lake and won't let any human being get anywhere near him. Clearly, his experiences with humans have been of an abusive nature. Twelve-year-old Charley doesn't need to take on his problems. She has problems enough of her own. She is only now able to walk after a car accident several months before. She lost her mother to a plane crash when she was ten. Her father spends most of his time at the office. She has built a new life around friends and town life, movies and the mall. Except that her best friend has left for the summer and she has been out of contact with the rest of her classmates since the accident. Charley is not a dog person, has never had one, has never thought about having one. But this dog, who is nothing but skin and bones and matted fur, pulls at her heart. Even though he plays happily with the other dogs around the lake, she senses a need in him for human attachment. It compels her to give him food, shelter, love. She names him Coyote and as she draws him nearer and nearer to her home and her heart, the healing process begins for both of them. I admit that after I read the first few pages, I shamelessly peeked at the end. As I have said in the about me page on my blog, I hate sad endings and most especially sad dog stories.

I can just imagine how much care went into the proofreading of the hundreds of obscure names that flow from Wolfe's pen.  Over and over again, the misspellings and the solecisms astound.  On the third page, we find out about \"Edgar Bergin.\"  Nice one, Wolfe.  You're supposed to be the Beverly Hills boy who KNEW all these people.  How about page 114: \"It was inferred in the press . . . \"  You know you want to say \"implied,\" but something just won't let you, will it? Actually the methodology of this book is almost exactly the same as that of Wolfe's last best-seller, in which he \"proved\" who killed Marilyn Monroe.  Just blame the most famous person you can think of.  He did it.  It's the same case here.  I love the two tables that prove it.  First table is, \"Facts we know about the Black Dahlia Killer.\"  Second heading is, \"Facts we know about [Wolfe's Suspect].\"  C'mon, Mr. Wolfe, didn't you get just a little bit of a chuckle stret-t-t-ch-ch-ch-i-ng Table Two to make it match Table One.  It's ludicrous on the face of it, and then you have to go drag in Robert Slatzer again!  The man who claimed to be Marilyn Monroe's second husband, the man who solved your first case, solves it again here! As for your dismissal of Hodel's book, think again.  You have dismissed nothing; however, you make it clear that you don't think the two photos Dr. Hodel left behind show Elizabeth Short in them.  But you'd have to say that, wouldn't you, for your theory to be true? There's much to love about Wolfe's book however, and he brings out a lot of information that I've never heard of before, and also some interesting theoretical tidbits.  The story of the man who was nearly arrested by LA police, the aspiring crime writer, Leslie Dillon, is chilling in the way it shows a right-wing police force slowly closing in their grip on any innocent person who comes their way and can be made into a scapegoat.  I recommend the book, but keep a bit of salt handy while plowing through it. Does anyone really think that Thelma Todd was killed by the same man who killed Elizabeth Short?  Wolfe does. Does anyone think that when Kirk Douglas dies we will finally find out the truth of what happened to all those women in the 1940s, like Jean Spangler?  It's lurid, but Wolfe puts it out there, repeating the 'rumors' that have surrounded Douglas' reputation for decades.  Face it, in the Dahlia business, there are no angels, except for Robert Slatzer of course, and except for John Gilmore, who's probably still cooing like a dove after the ass kissing he gets from Wolfe. And come on, those interrogations prove absolutely nothing.  The poor schnooks are there being given the third degree, asked nothing but leading questions, some of which they hesitantly agree with.  That's not proof if you ask me.  You can call them \"secret DA files\" if you want, to me it's just coerced and halfhearted testimony from people who knew nothing of the case.",

The Return of Skeleton Man fails in comparison to its first installment.

I found that her parents, not kidnapped this time by Skeleton Man, did not add to the story in the least. Finally, when Skeleton Man made his appearance in the last third of the book, it was anticlimactic.

I seem to remember the days of being in school where it was a requirement to read the entire book before writing a review (book report). I'm sick of reading reviews from losers and wannabes who never actually use the methods in this book (or any others) but yet have a load of opinions on whether the techniques work or not.  I've actually used these techniques for my company which has resulted in a multi-million dollar per year business. Like some of the most successful millionaires (and billionaires) say:  Don't listen to people unless they are making A LOT MORE than you are and they are in a position in life where you want to be.",

         "I think Donald H. Wolfe has come closer than anybody before him to determining what actually happened to Beth Short on January 14-15, 1947. If he's correct, he also explains the mystery of the murder of Bugsy Seigel. Bugsy Seigel's murder as explained in Dean Jennings' book We Only Kill Each Other, has never made much sense to me. The Flamingo Resort Casino, which was in a bad way in January of 1947 at the time of Beth Short's death, by June, when Seigel was killed, was already beginning to pay for itself. In Robert Lacy's book Little Man, the authorized biography of Meyer Lansky, written with the cooperation of the Lansky family, Meyer Lansky swore he never harmed his friend and partner, Ben Seigel. Outside of his being a gangster, why would he lie about it at the end of his life? The coinciding of Seigel's return to Los Angeles from Vegas expressly to raise money, with the MacCadden jewelry robberies and burgalries that took place in LA over those days, and the return of Beth Short from San Deigo on January 9th, an explaination starts to take shape. The coroner's report tells us that Beth Short was NOT tortured to death. She was killed by blunt force trauma to the side of her head by a metal instrument, and having her mouth slashed open. So the wounds inflicted to the body were made postmortum. This was a practical crime made to look like a crime of passion. Who would do something like this? Who would have the audacity to mutilate a body like that and then drop it off in a residential neighborhood a short walk from the home of LA crime boss Jack Dragna? Wolfe's theory makes a lot of circumstantial sense. We know from John Gilmore's book Severed that even LAPD believes that Jack Anderson Wilson, killed when his hotel room caught fire days after Gilmore's first article about him appeared in an LA paper, was present at the murder of the Black Daliah. But the specifics of the crime make it unlikely that Wilson was the only person involved. His own apparent murder makes one wonder, who is still alive who wants to maintain the secrecy around the motive and circumstances of Beth Short's death? From Dennis McDougal's book, Privileged Son we know that Norman Chandler, owner of the LA Times at the time of Short's murder, lived a scandlous secret life and,along with Ben Seigel, played a very close game with the corrupt LAPD of that day. I think Wolfe's solution is highly probable and expect that as more confidential files are made public we will eventually learn what happened to the Black Daliah.",

         5,
         "Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is one of the finest books I've ever read. I want to extend my deepest thanks to my girl Meredith for placing it in my borrowing hands. It's a fabulous reading experience that when explained verbally makes no sense. I'm sure that my breakdown of the plot structure didn't make anyone want to read it, but my neverending enthusiasm for the brilliance of the writer and all he accomplished in the 200+ pages of text probably did. Vonnegut is a genius of prose, and he handles a story that jumps back and forth through time and space like a kangaroo with a porcupine in its pouch with a delicate touch of dark humor that treads the boundary of the nearly ludicrous, but always stays this side of believable. It's an astonishing piece of anti-war sentiment that examines the life of Billy Pilgrim through the 4-dimensional eyes of time, seeing time and events therein as something that have always happened, is happening, and will always happen. This sets the time-hopping structure of the book. The book is rooted in Billy Pilgrim's situation as a prisoner of war, held captive first in a run down little camp that is pretty much headed by the distinguished Englishmen who have come to know the Nazi soldiers as comrades in arms, and then he is moved to Dresden, Germany; the site of a massacre that the combined destructive power of which took more lives than the Hiroshima bomb. We find out that Billy Pilgrim also became a optometrist, married a rich woman, and may or may not have been taken to a planet called Tralfamadore to be put on display in a zoo for the interest of the planet's inhabitants, who teach Billy about the true nature of time. I couldn't explain how or why this book drew me in with such power, but there is no doubt in my mind of its greatness. Vonnegut uses his characters to the anti-war angle splendidly, gives us some new perspectives about time to think about, and he sort of makes us feel guilty for wanting to chuckle at the snide moments of obscure humor he throws at us like eggs, and we're all the dumb football jock's car. It's a wonderful balancing act of psychological profiling, satire, theory, and love. This is a true timeless masterpiece.",

         4,
         "Over the years, I've read a few accounts of the Black Dahlia/Elizabeth Short murder case, including novels which it inspired (True Confessions by Dunne and Elroy's LA Quartet). This case will continue to fascinate because of the dramatic elements involved in real life: the LA Noir scene of the '40s and '50s, the Mob, the Hollywood connection, corrupt cops and politicians, a complicit DA. This is a case that is more fascinating than fiction, and because the LA law enforcement authorities resolutely keep the documentation secret they allow all kinds of speculation to continue to flourish. Wolfe's book neatly capitalizes on this. It is a highly readable book that captures the essence of the era; the post-war naievete of the public, the dewy-eyed optimism of the naifs drawn to the lure of Hollywood fame, the sleaze of the LA power-mongers. It captures a time when people could still be shocked by a gruesome murder, something sadly lost in the era of OJ Simpson, the Menendez brothers, and the Night Stalker. It is an era of lost innocence. Whether or not Wolfe has truly \"solved\" the case is hard to say. He paints a pretty convincing picture. But then you have to realize that though he obtained access to some investigative material not previously available, it's only some -- not all -- of the official records. Further material is provided to him in interviews with a very few of the players who are still alive over 50 years after the fact. Time dims and distorts memory; people lie when they know others who can prove their statements false are dead; one of Wolfe's sources (a self-confessed participant) was an alcoholic with a fried brain. Then, from the material provided to him Wolfe further extrapolates to reach his conclusions. At least a couple of his conclusions, particularly as to the involvement of a well-known Mob figure, seem to be a stretch. It may well be that this case will only be finally put to rest when the LAPD releases all of the contemporary documentation, and maybe not even then. In the meantime, Wolfe's book does present a very credible theory in a very readable and enjoyable fashion that's as interesting as almost anything written by Raymond Chandler. I recommend this book; you'll enjoy it.",

         1,
         "The author is great at presenting anecdotes of the ills of America's failing healthcare system.  But his proposed cure is worse than the disease.  His premise is that the capitalist method is bad, and only the socialist method of health care will correct all ills.  While it's true the capitalist system is far from perfect, and the US health care system in crises, a socialist takeover of healthcare is NOT the answer.  The only people who love that are the Big Brother politicians and the activist who want to rob from the rich.   Unfortunately for any serious reader, the author only examines and chronicles the ills of private health centers.  He completely ignores the ills of government run health care systems.  (I've been in some ... they are SCARY places indeed.)   The idea of the government -- the same one gave us the Katrina mess -- should take on health care and manage and control all doctors, hospitals and research is not a good idea.  Just look how politicians are interfering in and bungling medical marijuana, physician assisted suicide and abortion.  Anything that puts politicians (mostly all lawyers) in charge of doctors and medical science is very scary indeed.   The main reason the author's central premise is fundamentally flawed, he assumes that the ONLY way to get to universal coverage is through government run health care.  But that clearly is not true.  Everyone agrees that universal coverage is good.  We simply disagree on how to get there.  But we could very easily get there simply by preventing insurance companies from their current practices of excluding certain people based on their health status, and their efforts to deny coverage to covered persons based on obscure policy rules as judged by a claims adjuster.  This one simple rule change -- full coverage, with no discriminating against anyone based on their health status -- would dramatically change the coverage landscape.  If we prohibited such discrimination, saying insurance companies can only charge one price for all of their customers, must cover everything considered \"medically necessary\" as judged by the DOCTOR (not a politician!), and can never deny coverage to anyone who can pay the premium, then we would grow to universal coverage very quick.  It would take us back to the original premise of insurance, which is to spread the risk.  The profit incentive then, rather than trying to exclude poor or sick people, instead would be to bring as many people into the program as possible to spread the risk.  The problem of universal coverage would be solved without having to take on a huge government takeover of medical care as the author suggest.  But this, and other such solutions, are not even considered or examined. Another major flaw with this book, it examines in detail why insurers do not have people's health at heart, but then leaps over gaps in logic to conclude that government will do better, without examining other alternatives.  While the arguments presented against insurers interfering with coverage are sound, it apparently never occurs to the author that there's a whole other group of people who could do a better job of handling our health care than either insurers or politicians -- namely doctors and health care professionals themselves. This book could be better if it examined whether perhaps the better persons to be in charge of health care would be, not politicians or insurers, but doctors and health care professionals.  But it doesn't even explore that possibility. Are you ready to trust your politicians to take care of your health instead of your doctor?  If so, then this book is just the pill for you to swallow.  For the rest of us who know better, any book suggesting that your medicine should be delivered to you by politicians all too happy to tax you for the privileges they grant to you is hardly worth the paper on which it is printed.",

Suicide was a recurring theme. The good aspects: The narration on the mundane was interesting and gave the kinds of perspectives (albeit cynical and erratic) not shared in most other sci-fi novels. The novel did not progress in the standard linear fashion, with the narration frequently relating events to ones that had yet to take place.  This made the novel's parts fit together quite well. The novel had some extra randomness.  Not all events are conveniently constructed to aid the story.  Some things don't happen \"for a reason\", they just happen.  That's life.

True, it's still not told in linear fashion (this is Vonnegut, after all), and few Vonnegut fans would want it that way, anyhow. The book is a page turner because of the way it is written... like in several of his other books, Kurt mentions events that happen later in the narrarative early on, and uses this as a fairly enticing suspense maneuver. The story and theme elements themselves are interesting: de-evolution (plus such related things as genetics, and all things Darwin), the environment, and more. Although this is not his best book (I still refer to Cat's Cradle as that), this book is well-written, coherent, funny, witty, and less fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants than most of Vonnegut's oeuvre, and thus, in fact a pretty good place for newbies to the author to start.",

I have to admit this is one of the few books where I saw the movie first (years ago), and about 3 years ago, I decided to read the novel. Left a deep impact on me, although I had a hard time understanding it.  So a couple of months ago I saw the movie again, loved it again (although I normally detest movies done after books), and then decided to read all of Vonnegut's novels and shortstories, and chronologically this time, starting out with the promising Player Piano.  Now I reread Slaughterhouse Five, and so far it is Vonnegut's best book. It is clearly an attempt to describe his impressions in World War Two and especially Dresden, but instead of writing a realistic novel about war, Vonnegut 'invents' a totally non-linear genre of science fiction that is absolutely unique in its scope.  There is no suspense at all, because the novel's main character (not to call him hero) Billy Pilgrim is unstuck in time, which means he travels back and forth in time. We meet a young Pilgrim traumatized by his gun-loving father, a Pilgrim lost in World War Two, a Pilgrim married to the obese daughter of a rich John Birch Society nutcase and above all a happy Pilgrim living on Tralfamadore, a planet in a faraway solar system. All this is narrated in no particular order, and maybe the book needs to be read twice to get its scope, but it is worth it.  Vonnegut's style also reaches a level that I haven't seen of him in the past, very bitter-sarcastic-loving-sweet... all at once. Every death is followed by a shrugged \"So it goes.\", and paragraphes are often introduced with \"Listen:\". In a heartwarming sad tale, Vonnegut tells us not only of the senselessness of war (where there are no crooks, just victims), but also teaches the reader a valuable moral: focus on the positive moments of your life.  Then there are some characters which avid Vonnegut fans will love to see back: wretched sci-fi writer Kilgore Trout, millionaire Eliot Rosewater and American nazi Howard Campbell jr. Plus two goofs: the border between Luxembourg and Germany is a valley, not a hill, and people with an IQ of 103 are of average intelligence, not morons.  Read this book though.  Poo-tee-weet?",

         "In HATING AMERICA: THE NEW WORLD SPORT, John Gibson aggressively indicts France, Britain, Germany, Belgium, South Korea, Canada, and most Arab states as vicious haters of the United States in general and George Bush in particular. Gibson notes the increasing tendency for these and other world nations to lash out at the United States for reasons that have little to do with Iraq but much to do with a disagreeable mixture of insecurity, jealousy, and personal animosity toward an American president who is not bashful about using unilateral force against terrorist regimes.  Ironically, most left wing liberals side with these America bashers even if they fail to point out a substitute course of agreed on action.  What Gibson shows is a widespread and monstrously deep hatred of traditional American values, not the least of which is the right of America to act unilaterally in its own defense.  Gibson does try to explain away the origins of these America haters as originating in the tightly intertwined destiny of the crowded city states of Europe that suffered greatly during the last two world wars and have learned to lean over in a spinebreaking fashion to avoid conflict with one aggressor nation by forging ill-fated alliances with other nations.  The target audience of HATING AMERICA is most likely those who already agree with Gibson.  His style is strident, a message well posited by the title of his closing chapter: \"They're Wrong. We're Right. Get Used to It.\" If hating America is truly the new world sport, then Gibson's book goes a long way toward fanning the fires of a rivalry that will easily eclipse the next Red Sox incursion into Yankee Stadium.",

'Some of the Bush idealogues in the media compare Washington to ancient Rome.  It is a  permissable fantasy, but they should remember that (a) the Romans never expected to be loved and (b) that Rome, too, fell.'\" (page 70) There is truth in that statement, as Gibson points out, much as we hate to hear it.  Americans want to be loved.  When the Brits ruled the world, they never expected to be admired--only obeyed and, perhaps, feared.  We, on the other hand, want desperately to be liked.  But the hand that holds out the food, and rules, is usually hated, and often bitten.  That is just a fact of life that one must expect. John Gibson has written an awesome compilation of facts here supporting his thesis that we, the most powerful nation on earth, are vastly despised, despite all of the sacrifices we have made in blood and money in the last century to make the world better.  Are we surprised then, that France, whom we have saved from the despotism and horror of two world wars, is among our most ardent foes?  Or the Palestinians, whom we have striven to achieve justice for during a couple of generations, holds an abiding hatred for us?  Or the Germans, Belgians, South Koreans, Spanish, Italians--all of Europe (for whom we have bled copiously), in fact, hold us in contempt or, at least distrust us? Even the Brits, our most trusted allies, look down on us as springing from an inferior civilization. As they said in the Second World War, while we were bleeding for their sake, it was said that the greatest fault of the Yanks were that we were, \"Overfed, overpaid, oversexed and over here.\"  No gratitude, even then in the midst of battle. But, when all is said and done, at least for the moment (which is about as long as any political system lasts in the overall scheme of things), as Gibson points out we are the most powerfful nation on earth, militarily and economically.  We have, at least for now, achieved that status while France, Spain, Italy and Russia have declined until they are no longer the masters of their own fate: the victims of socialism.  Even the proud British Empire, upon which it was once said that \"the sun never sets,\" is now a mere shadow of its former glory. The United States of America may not be far behind, as the ugly head of socialism rears its head, replacing our constitutional freedoms to a greater and greater extent.  But for now, at least, we are the force with which to be reckoned--the one of which to be jealous--we are the source of power. It is not, therefore, ours to be loved.  Rather, it is ours to be respected, if for no other reason than our strength.  That must be enough, for now.  They will, no doubt, gloat when we fall, and perhaps when and if we are as weak as they, then they will love us.  Doubtful?  Who knows? This is a fine book, psychoanalyzing our avowed enemies. and explaining how they got to be that way.  I recommend it.  John Gibson is the host of Fox News Channel's The Big Story. God Bless America.

Also, I have to say, many of his comments on Ireland and the Irish people seem far too sweeping, far too subjective for a man of Burleigh's usual insight and historical training, and are difficult to take seriously.

Once the book is read, the child will be able to use it as a temporary resource when some uncomfortable feeling creeps in.  The clever dialogue in explaining the term will allow the child to sort out the solution in a way to make it more manageable.   It's not really a cookie recipe book; it's a metaphor for handling difficult situations with cookie-size portions of care.",

         "This book deserves 7 stars for pointing out the fallacies of how most entrepreneurs operate.  The book deserves 1 star for proposing a standard that most people cannot hope to meet and then pushing to sell you  consulting services.  Pay attention to the former, and go light on the  latter. Gerber is correct that most entrepreneurs are limited by a  comfort zone of wanting to remain in control as either strong technicians  or managers, which limits the potential of the business.  As soon as they  exceed what they can handle, the business either fails in a break-out  attempt or shrinks back to a simpler state.  The new businesses that  succeed the most are the ones that have a business model that is easy to  replicate with ordinary people. Where Gerber goes wrong is in  suggesting that many people can develop such business models.  I regularly  study the top 100 CEOs in the country for stock-price growth, and few of  them think they can develop a new business model.  Why should someone  starting up a new company be likely to do better than that?  They won't.  In fact, I have a friend who attempted to start a new business following  Gerber's principles and almost failed before he adjusted to normal  operating approaches.  He spent so much time developing his business model,  that he never got around to operating it. Gerber's three favorite  examples are McDonald's, Disney, and Fed Ex.  Notice that two of the three  got most of their ideas from someone else for the business model (Ray Kroc  from the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, California and Fred Smith  from an Indian air freight operation). I think there is another fallacy  here:  You can get ordinary people to do simple things (deliver packages,  cook and deliver cheap hamburgers, and smile at people on automated rides).  But in many businesses the demands of the market are extraordinary such as  in many technological product businesses and services.  Microsoft has a  business model, but it is not one that Gerber would recognize. Finally,  he condemns people who want to operate their business as a job by being  technically expert.  Where would we be if people never did that?  What if  Peter Drucker spent all of his time developing business systems to make  pizzas and tacos rather than writing business books about management?  What  if great musicians developed business models for teaching children to play  the violin and piano rather than performing?  In other words, there is room  and a need for extraordinarily able one-person companies run by  technicians. Skip the pitch for the consulting services at the end.  You'll like the book better if you do. But don't let my quibbles keep you  as an entrepreneur from failing to appreciate the excellent case Gerber  makes for having a business model as soon as possible, and working  systematically to improve it.  If you can do that, you may well develop a  true irresistible growth enterprise.",

On page 59 he says,  \"The conviction that human beings are endowed with such a power [free will] is pervasive, even more so than a belief in the human soul...As a philosophical concept, free will is like an onion whose skin has been completely peeled away: at its core, it ceases to exit.\" Dr. Silver is no friend of religion.

However, it's worth reading, if only to experience a story so different from modern sensibilities. The poem extols Beowulf's physical courage and bravery against monsters and dragons. It's an odd mix of early Christian and warrior ethos. Beowulf is not a modern hero. There's not much to recommend him to modern readers - he's boastful, relies on brawn not brains, and his search for glory ends up putting his kingdom at risk. Still, it's fascinating to read this type of story and realize how far away it is from our own times. Because this is a translation of an Anglo-Saxon poem, it's worth saying a word about the text itself. It's readable, but isn't smooth reading for the uninitiated. I'd say this - if you don't like reading English-language poetry, you probably won't enjoy reading this poem. If you do make the effort, I'd recommend really making the effort. Go slow and make sure you understand the story. Don't skip over a few lines thinking they're not as relevant.",

         5,
         "This is one in a series of inexpensive but superbly produced biographies created for younger readers (ages 7-9) that enable them to gain a much better understanding and appreciation of key figures throughout U.S. history, most of whom also had significant impact worldwide.  That is certainly true of Rosa Parks (February 4, 1913 - October 24, 2005). As is true of the other volumes in this series, this mini-biography is based on rock-solid historical material and includes a number of archival photos to supplement the lively narrative created by the Time editors in collaboration with Karen Kellaher. I feel obligated to add, that this is not a book written for younger \"dummies\" or \"idiots.\" It ought to be in all school and public libraries and would be an excellent birthday or holiday gift for children, one that parents, grandparents, and other relatives should consider. To this day, a false but remarkably durable misunderstanding suggests that, on December 1, 1955, when Rosa Parks \"stepped onto a bus - and into history,\" she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, she did so only because she was tired after another long and wearying day of work as a seamstress in a department store in Montgomery, Alabama. \"People always say that I didn't give up my seat because I was tired, but that isn't true.... No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.\" \"Rosa hated segregation, and she hoped that the laws would change one day. But she did not know that her own act of courage would lead the way,\" as indeed it did. In this volume, we learn about her childhood and life on a farm, her experiences in a culture that was separate but hardly equal, her \"act of courage,\" the bus boycott that followed, her active involvement in the civil rights movement, her friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr., and her various activities in later years such as the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development until declining health prevented her from traveling, participating in freedom marches, and delivering speeches. In 1996, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and, three years later, the Congressional Gold Medal. She died at the age of ninety-two. According to Congressman John Conyers for whom she worked in his Detroit office for many years, \"Rosa Parks showed us that everybody counts. When we all decide to do something, it amounts to a wave of energy that can indeed change things. She taught us that nobody should be held back because of their skin color. Each individual is important and powerful. That was her gift to us.\" And that will continue to be her gift to generations to come. Those who wish to learn more about Rosa Parks are urged to check out her autobiography,  Rosa Parks: My Story with Jim Haskins as well as  Douglas Brinkley's  Rosa Parks: A Life, Faith Ringgold's If A Bus Could Talk: The Story of Rosa Parks, The Story of Rosa Parks co-authored by Patricia A. Pingry and Steven Walker, Rosa co-authored by Nikki Giovanni and Bryan Collier, Quiet Strength by Rosa Parks and Gregory J.

         "What a wandering mess. The story is supposed to be an exploration of American mythsa story in which the old gods of America and the new gods of America go to war with each other. The novel fails on a number of counts. The novel doesn't really have much to do with American gods at all. The book is mostly about some washed up Norse gods with a smattering of Egyptian and Russian gods thrown in. This could have potentially worked as a book idea, but the way in which Gaiman frames his story is most unsatisfying. Immigrants bring their gods with them to America in this book, but there weren't any immigrants bringing over these gods. He tries to make some excuse for this, but it's thin. I mean reallyAnubis is an undertaker in the midwest? Anubis is an American god? It's so lame. He doesn't use much that's authentically American in the story. The gods of Greece and Rome would be one step closer to Americana than Odin and Thoth, but he doesn't mention them. Christianity barely makes an appearance in this book. I suppose I'm thankful for that since Gaiman probably would have botched it and the book would have been even worse. Even so, it's curious that a book about American gods hardly recognizes America's most popular religion. America is much more religious than most other developed countries. The fact that the book didn't grapple with this fact makes it a poorer book. Gaiman keeps saying that America is a hard place for gods. That just goes to show that Gaiman doesn't understand America. Faith in America is much stronger than it is where Gaiman comes from. Besides the fact that the book was a mess thematically, it's a mess structurally too. It's long. It's tedious. Characters come and go with no real importance or impact on the narrative. The main character doesn't seem to have much depth, but then all the sudden he's talking like Socrates, but then he goes back to lameness. There's no consistency. Some scenes are interesting and entertaining, while others are filled with clunky prose. The book would have been much stronger if his editor would have forced him to cut it down by about half. Actually, I read the tenth-anniversary edition in which Gaiman adds in twelve thousand words that his editors cut from the original. I should have realized that this was going to be a mistake. After reading it, I've decided that he should have trusted his editor. Actually if his editor was doing his job he would have cut an additional thirty thousand words. The worst bits are when Gaiman intersperses the chapters with \"interludes\" which explain how various gods came to America. These interludes are so boring. The thematic failings wouldn't have hurt the book so much if it had been shorter and less serious. Instead the book aspires to some kind of epic meditation on the soul of America and it buckles under it's own pretensions. Not recommended.

The author is uniquely qualified for this task and explains the processes and reasons for the processes of what he calls Verbal Judo with wonderful stories and analogies that illustrate his points, having apparently, spent the better part of his early life verbally reacting to situations with all the predictable negative outcomes that he intersperses so eloquently in the text.",

         "Gaiman summed up my feeling while reading the novel pretty well in this quote from the book: \"All things have rules.\" \"Yeah,\" said Shadow. \"But nobody tells me what they are. You keep talking about the rules, I don't even know what game you people are playing.\" The fact of the matter is that there are no rules in this story. It felt to me a little like \"Lost\"  I kept asking myself, where's this long, winding story going? Ultimately, I think the answer is simply wherever Gaiman felt like taking it at the moment he was writing a particular scene. I thought I would like this novel because I'm a fan of mythology. I was fascinated long ago by Joseph Campbell's writing on myth, and I hoped that American Gods would do justice to the magic and mystery of traditional mythology, and that Gaiman would channel the gods of old to enrich a modern novel... not so much. It felt to me more like Gaiman was polluting old, beloved myths with modern grit and crass. And it just made no sense. Why so many obscure gods, when ones that are still commonly worshiped are nowhere to be found? Why so many gruesome myths? Where are the beautiful myths, and where is the beautiful side of mythology? There is only one notable exception, and of course it has to do with a beautiful woman. Why so many sub-stories that have nothing to do with the plot? Why doesn't the main character ask more questions early on? I think a good example of Gaiman's bias toward the darker, dirtier side of myth is in his depiction of Hindu deities: The only major role is given to Kali, a relatively obscure deity. Durga, her purer counterpart, isn't mentioned. The major deities, like Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva are nowhere to be found. Ganesh, so popularly worshipped that you'll see his likeness in hotels and restaurants across America, has a bit part. There is a bizarre allusion to Jesus Christ that was odd in that it didn't seem well developed and just didn't need to be there, except perhaps so that Gaiman could claim one more religious/mythical reference. All that being said, Gaiman writes extremely well. He writes so well that you really want the story to deliver. He imbibes depth and complexity into his storytelling. He understands the function of myth, and he writes with that understanding in mind. The plot also does have some clever twists to it. The last quarter of the book was much easier for me to read than the first three quarters. My recommendation: If you're interested in Neil Gaiman, try Anansi Boys, which is similar but more light-hearted and less ambitious (and that felt appropriate to me), or Good Omens (co-written with Terry Pratchett). Oh, one little nitpick: The Hindu goddess is a motherly figure that asks that people call her Mama-ji. Uh... that means \"Uncle on your mother's side\" in Hindi. It's repeated several times, and each time I wondered why Gaiman hadn't bothered to google the phrase when he was writing...",

Thus began a relationship between Finkel and the man who stole his identity, Chris Longo. While Longo awaits trial for the murders of his wife and three small children, Finkel visits Longo in prison and the two begin exchanging letters. Slowly a portrait of a psychopath emerges. Longo has only a high school education and no skills, but he has a family to support. He cant stand the thought of failure. So, he invents success through lies and deceit. He writes bad checks because he needs money for his family and his failing business. He steals an SUV because his wife always wanted one and he wants to be seen as a good provider. Finkel tells Longos story while at the same time reflecting on his own indiscretions and the mistake that cost him his job. Heres how Finkel sums up Longos story. My year with Longo made me see how a persons life could spiral out of control; how one could get lost in a haze of dishonesty, and how these things could have dire consequences. Throughout the book Finkel leaves Longos guilt or innocence in question. This part memoir, part portrait of a psychopath, is also a murder mystery. You want to know hat happened and why. As it turns out, Longo gives three different versions of what happened to his family. And since Longo is the only one who knows the truth, you're left to decide on your own which version is correct.",

I've taught teenagers from the world that Rise and Jesse supposedly come from (Houston, not Harlem, though).  My students don't recognize themselves in C.J. and Jesse--there's something artificial about their relationships, something too solid.  Teens of all income-levels tend to experience more tumult than this book shows even as dramatic events unfold.

         "Not very many authours can write a quiet and elegant romance novel that revolves around a couple forced to marry and not fill it with swirling and overpowering emotion (be it anger, hate or passion) so that you rather loose sight of the original plot premise, the forced marriage. But Candice Hern succeeded admirably here, I thought. A word of warning however, if you're more in the mood for a romance novel that fairly reeks of sexual tension and passion, you might want to give \"Once a Gentleman\" a miss. If on the other hand you're in the mood for a book about a couple that are compelled to marry, where the heroine is in love with the hero, but where it takes the man a while to fully appreciate and fall in love with his admirable wife, that is written in a more restrained vein, then you definitely will enjoy \"Once a Gentleman.\" Nicholas Parrish as always seen Prudence Armitage as a mousy but intelligent friend -- the good sort, but definitely not the type he would ever consider marrying. And yet, because he unintentionally ends up compromising her, that is exactly what happens. Now newly married man Nicholas Parrish has to consider the best way to go about making his marriage to shy and demure Prudence work. To start with, he'll be the very picture of a patient husband and not press her for marital intimacies until she's ready. What Nicholas didn't know, however, was that Prudence has been in love with him for quite a while now, and that she is more than willing to be \"true\" wife to him. But Prudence also realizes that she's not the type of wife Nicholas would have chosen for himself if he had had the choice. Will Nicholas and Prudence be able to make their marriage work? Or will continue to blunder about in misconception and misapprehension forever? I think what I liked most about \"Once a Gentleman\" was that both the hero and heroine are nice, likable people -- it's nice to read a romance novel where you like both the main characters and where you don't spend a lot of time wanting to brain either. Another thing I really liked was that the authour didn't take the path of turning her heroine into a sudden supermodel with a few snips of the hair and a new wardrobe. Yes, Prudence does get a new hairstyle and more attractive clothes, but she suddenly doesn't become the Season's latest sensation with hordes of Regency bucks panting after her, thus making the novel another one of those where the hero learns to appreciate his wife via jealousy. Prudence remains the shy, reserved young lady that charmed me from the very beginning. And this allowed for the authour to add a little humour to the bits where Prudence tries to flirt with Nicholas only to have things go terribly wrong. It also made things seem terribly realistic. If you know nothing about flirting, and are not used to it, to suddenly acquire the prowess of a siren seems rather unrealistic, and yet you always see this in most books! Also nicely done was the gradual manner in which Nicholas grows to love and appreciate his wife (and to learn to be a little less proud and self absorbed). Nicholas has a lot of less admirable traits to get rid off, and the authour shows him coming to grips with his less admirable side in a very believable manner. \"Once a Gentleman\" doesn't have a very complicated plot. Rather, it focuses completely on the relationship between a husband and wife. It is a somewhat quiet read, but a rather romantic one at that.",

I enjoyed this book but not nearly as much as many of the other reviewers appear to have. Like some I think it would have worked much better in a shorter form. It would have been the perfect length for a New Yorker feature for example. Certain elements of the story get repeated so many times as to encourage section skipping, something I normally don't do in a book I like. There are a couple of things in the book that rang a little odd to me. Referring to Randy's travels to Bangkok as \"exploring\" the religion of \"hedonism\" is hopefully intended as humor, and there are other places where the writer glosses over what seem to be major lapses in relationship judgement. Ditto for Randy's female friend in the mountains, who escapes with barely a scratch despite some pretty questionable tactics. I also did not really grasp the picture painted of Alden Nash, who seems to graduate from passive, annoyed observer to active participant only after the mystery has been solved. Maybe the writer had to steer around some complex politics in writing this book given that so many of the participants are still alive and even contributed to his work. If the book's aim was to show what an incredible ranger and asset to our parks Randy was, then it succeeded completely. He seemed to be the absolute ideal ranger. Indeed I would have liked to have seen him move more into oversight and politics as he got older, as his thoughts on managing parks and visitors aligned very closely with my own.",

         "I found this fascinating.  I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning to finish it.  It is a true crime story written in a clear, elegant style.  Every sentence is polished, and every sentence is planned and placed in exactly the right place.  There is no obvious striving for effect, no lurid prose, no fancy writing.  Michael Finkel employs what George Orwell once called the invisible style.  The writing is so unobtrusive, so deliberate in not calling attention to itself that what the reader experiences is the story itself, pure and simple. Or stories.  The book is like a film or a commercial novel in that there is a main plot and a subplot.  The main plot is the story of Christian Longo who murdered his wife and three children and then ran to Mexico where he pretended to be Michael Finkel, ace reporter for the New York Times.  This was a startling coincidence because Finkel had just been fired from the Times for falsifying a story about cocoa plantation \"slaves\" in West Africa.  He was disgraced and fallen from the pinnacle of journalistic prestige.  That is the subplot.  Both stories are interwoven together in a masterful way.  And the sequence of events is presented in a dramatic--not a strictly chronological--way so that the tension is maintained and the reader is led to eagerly turn the pages. The overall story began when Finkel found out about Chris Longo impersonating him.  Struck with the coincidence, he felt compelled to know more about Longo and why the accused murderer took on his name.  He contacted Longo and worked hard to establish rapport and a friendship.  His motive was to get as much information from Longo as he could in order to write a book.  The book would fuse the story of his disgrace with that of a man who had murdered his family.  The thread that ties the stories together is not just the initial coincidence but an obsession with honesty that haunted both men and the obvious lack of honesty that they both practiced.  Both Finkel and Longo strove again and again to come completely clean about what they had done and what they were doing while using each other under the guise of friendship.  Longo used Finkel as somebody to talk to (he had been isolated from the other prisoners and had almost no contact with anyone other than his lawyers) and as a sounding board for his defensive strategy.  Finkel used Longo as a source for a story that would restart his career.  As Finkel makes vivid, both men were more than a little desperate. At one point Finkel gives part of the voluminous correspondence he had with Longo to three shrinks.  They conclude that Longo has a narcissistic personality.  He may indeed be narcissistic, but more to the point, Longo is a psychopath.  He has all the classic features: a charming personality; a behavioral record of lies and thefts and murders; a grotesque sense of ultimately caring about nobody but himself; and finally an ability to be completely without remorse and able to party after his crimes, as he did in Mexico. Ironically, I think it is Finkel who has at least a touch of the narcissistic personality.  We can see this in his tendency toward an exaggerated sense of his own importance, first in imagining that the world would be all that interested in his story (ah, but he made the world interested by his skillful writing) and in this from page 267 (he's talking to Longo's lawyers who want ideas for Longo's defense): He writes, \"I felt, at that moment, as though Longo's life was in my hands--that if I said the right thing, he'd be spared the death penalty.\"  We can also see this in the tremendous amount of energy Finkel put into researching and writing this book.  He desperately wanted to regain his reputation and to be regarded again as a top flight journalist. Both men are caught in a moral confusion about lies and honesty, Longo because he's a psychopath who doesn't understand how people can be so upset about lying since it would seen to be the natural thing to do if it might benefit you (sociopaths learn at an early age that they are supposed to be remorseful about lying, and that it's bad, but they never really appreciate why, and so they are fascinated with the dynamics); Finkel because as he freely admits has told many lies in his life including the lies that ended his career at the New York Times.  Neither has apparently thought much about Emerson's \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\"  Neither seems to understand that it is not so much the absolute consistency of what you say as it is your motive for what you say and especially how what you say affects others.  That is what counts.  Most people know this.  Furthermore everybody lies at one time or another, but not when bearing witness and not when the lives of other people might be adversely affected. I think what fascinated Finkel about Longo was that he could see in him a caricature of himself; and as long as he could imagine that Longo might not be guilty or as long as he didn't look too closely at the murders, that was tolerable.  However after sitting through the trial and hearing Longo's grotesque self-serving lies about the murders and the horrific details, Finkel had to psychologically distance himself from his would-be, partial alter-ego.  And rightly so since there is something terribly unsettling about their symbiotic relationship. But in the final analysis I say good for Michael Finkel.  This is an outstanding work, a fine addition to a genre I like to call \"participatory journalism.\"  What Finkel learned about himself from this chancy venture is possibly as important as what this book has done for his career and for his self-esteem.",

         2,
         "A few years ago I tried this diet and was extremely successful. I achieved my goal at the time: to lose weight. But over the years I've slowly put the weight back on, so I pulled this book back off the shelf, dusted it off, and thought I'd try it again. Well, I was so shocked by what I saw in the recipes that I felt compelled to write a review. Let me be clear - as a weight loss plan, this worked. Combined with rigorous exercise, I lost about 20 pounds. I followed it to the letter. My copy of the book still has my original sticky notes & flags all over the place. I remember it being EXTREMELY rough at first, but that's because I'm hypoglycemic. At the time my blood sugar was so out of whack that Phase I initially sent me into full-blown insulin shock. I had headaches & severe dizzy spells, so I had to adjust it a little (added fruit & was careful with workouts), but I remember that after a week or so things leveled out and I felt better. I stuck with the \"diet\" until I achieved my goal weight, then stuck with it a while longer, then gradually fell away from it (and the weight crept back on). So I thought I'd try it again. HOWEVER - when I opened up my trusty \"diet\" book (because I remembered South Beach very fondly), I was SHOCKED at the actual recipes. This diet makes extensive use of artificial sweeteners and processed foods. And I really do mean extensive. Everything is fat-free this, sugar-free that. Every \"substitute\" you can think of (liquid eggs, margarine, processed lunch meats, etc.). It's like the author made a list of real, whole foods, and then made a \"cheat sheet\" - a list of every fake version of real food that he could find. I looked at this with new eyes and realized that of course I lost weight - I was eating fake food. I didn't change anything about my life with this diet - I just \"cheated\" until I was thin again. In the years in between the first time I used this diet and now, I've done a LOT of reading about nutrition, diets, and our food industry. Specifically, how our food is grown and processed. I guess my perspective has changed, and this time I don't just want to lose the 15 pounds I've put back on. This time I want to be HEALTHY. I want to eat food that is good for my body. It isn't just about getting thin. It's about avoiding cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and all the other diseases that scare me. Now I'm seeing this diet with new eyes, and I'm horrified and a little nauseated by the thought of how many chemicals and artificial ingredients I was pouring into my body. Did I lose weight? Absolutely. But at the time I didn't stop to think about whether or not this diet was actually HEALTHY or GOOD for my body. I didn't think about the nitrates in all that turkey bacon & lunchmeat I was eating. Or what happens to food when they take out the fat and the sugar (and what they put back IN). Anyway - I'm writing this review for people who may not realize that this diet relies extensively on artificial and processed foods. I'm NOT knocking anyone who uses this diet or even saying it doesn't work. We all know that saying \"just eat in moderation and exercise, and you will lose weight\" doesn't work or we'd all be thin. Most of us don't have the will power to give up all the stuff we KNOW is bad and stick to salads (myself included). But \"dieting\" and \"getting healthy\" are two totally different things, and I think people should know that this is a DIET, not a health plan (like the author claims). This is about finding \"cheat\" foods so you don't feel deprived of the junk you usually eat. It's just my opinion that those \"cheat\" foods aren't any healthier, nutritionally speaking, than the junk food. Personally, I didn't learn anything from this diet. Obviously it didn't have a lasting impact, because I didn't stick with it (even though I meant to). You know that saying 'cheaters never win' - that pretty much sums up how I feel about this diet. Get this one from the library BEFORE you buy it. Maybe the things that bother me won't bother you. But you should know what you're getting, and you should read a few other books about nutrition, before spending your hard earned money on this book. Personally, I'm going to look elsewhere for an eating plan that puts *real* food first. Sorry South Beach, but that's just not you!",

         "This true story is about identity theft of the worst kind, by an alleged murderer who chose the name of his favorite journalist, Michael Finkel.  How in a million years could he choose that name out of a hat? Alastair Reid wrote, \"What is true lies between you and the idea of you -- a friciton, restless, between the fact and the fiction\" in his book WHERE TRUTH LIES.  We can all take what we want to believe and make it 'truth' as we see it.  It may be a fantasy or, as in this case, a coverup for something bad. Sometime in 2001, the Longo family (wife and three children) are found murdered; the father, Christian, is captured in Mexico using the alias of Micahel Finkel of the 'New York Times.'  The real M. F. is indeed a writer for the 'Times magazine.'  After the capture of the 'false' M. F., the real one is fired for \"falsifying part of an investigative article.\" He now has the time to dig and discover why this particular individual wanted to be him.  The two men exchange nearly 1,000 letters, talk on the phone about his upcoming trial, and talk face-to-face in the prison visiting area.  He becomes emotionally involved in the case and sets out to prove the innocence of his new friend (in a slightly unusual way).  It seems that Longo had lived a life of deception and lies, and the truth is never as he tries to make it. This reads more like a novel with the two protaganists on the same side of the law, and yet at times, they are disbelieving of each other and the reasons they are communicating.  Of course, the journalist gets a book out of the process.  But what does the theif of his identity receive as a consequence.  The author lives in Bozeman, Montana.",

         "Author Eric Blehm clearly cares about the American wilderness and the people, like Randy Morgenson, who take responsibility for and at times succumb to its harsh beauty, but he's not very good at telling the reader about any of that. At one point, he quotes Wallace Stegner, who provided a harsh (but honest) critique to Morgenson himself, when Morgenson tried his own hand at writing, saying, \"It's all about your feelings and sensations, and those don't communicate well to a reader. He half feels you indulging a sort of yeasty nature mysticism....\" That's Blehm. The young Morgenson is a \"dashing young ranger,\" \"with ... expressive, gentle eyes that held a hint of something she couldn't put her finger on. Mystery, perhaps.\" Duh. Typical of Blehm's narrative is a \"description\" of an incident when Morgenson and a fellow ranger were called upon to handle a plane crash in the back country. The anecdote should be rich with detail. Instead, all we get is, \"A plane had crashed, it was windy, snow squalls were settling in over the higher peaks, and ... the helicopter took off with their packs still inside. ...They had no survival gear. Fortunately, the helicopter was able to make it back through the clouds to pick them up after the operation.\" And that's it. No specifics. No details. We get the occasional quote from Morgenson's logs (e.g., \"I yearned to know the plants, geology, glaciology, weather, and the effects of these things on each other\") but unlike Morgenson, who supposedly gave \"two pages\" in his logbooks to \"the song of the hermit thrush,\" Blehm offers only generalities. After wading through several hundred pages of Blehm's starry-eyed blather, I came away thoroughly disgusted with the late Mr. Morgenson. He appears to have been a selfish aging hippie who, having cheated on his wife and been served with divorce papers, walked off into the mountains, leaving his colleagues with the job of a heartbreaking and ultimately fruitless search-and-rescue mission. (His remains were found by a California Conservation Corps trailbuilding group about five years after his disappearance, near a gorge \"where grasses and mountain flowers made a living in patches of silt and rocky soil.\" Again, no details.) Blehm could have used a few classes in botany, geology, glaciology, weather, and the effects of these things on each other and on the human beings who love and work in the American wilderness.

So, after reading the author's account of his \"crime\" (which alternates in this book with Long's horrific crimes), plus the account of the NY Times and others, I do not see evidence of a crime of any sort.  For all those writers (journalists) who think they are being totally truthful and tell the truth and nothing but the truth, have they forgotten that \"there is nothing new under the sun\" (Ecclesiastes 1:19) and that therefore all writing is in some way pilfered from other sources.  For Finkel, who is a fine writer, to have been fired for what he did is as ridiculous as historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's name being smeared in a hateful manner for doing something similar.  How on earth can a story be told, any story, without using something that is not entirely new?  There are only so many ways the scant letters of our alphabet can be arranged. That being said, this is a very readable book and I wish the best to the author and hope to read more of his works soon.

I consider Wittgenstein important in this book because the relationship between philosophy and silence is expressed so well in the final verse of the poem \"The Twelve Lies\" by Rumi (1204-1273): So just keep silent, and if anyone says to you, \"No communion takes place without words,\" just say to him, \"I heard that lie.\"  (p. 347). There are 14 poems by Rumi in this book, in the first of which: The kind of love we know of is too great for sober reason  (p. 334).

If they look like they're part of a trilogy, they probably have alot of complexity, storybuilding, and grand design.  People struggle to get 1 book written, so authors must be pretty good to get a whole trilogy (or more) written, right?  That's what I thought.  I was wrong. This one was just plain boring and juvenile.  So many of the things that happened had me thinking: \"Huh?\"  Why would they do that?  It honestly read like it was written by a high-school student for a junior-high audience.  Sorry.  I know that's mean.  I just couldn't \"get\" why people were doing the things they were.  Had the writing been engaging or the story been original, maybe it could have been something.  Maybe the rest of the series picks up... maybe the trilogy is better... I won't be finding out though.

Being an avid reader of fantasy, I was especially glad to see a good plot develop through this trilogy as well.  It's been a long time since a new work came out that had all the major elements(plot, character, background and dialogue) nailed down in a well written fashion. This series would be just about perfect if the there was a pronunciation guide for the character names.  Sonea and Ceryni, two of the first characters you get to meet have names that could be pronounced any number of ways.  It's a real drag to find out after several years that you've been pronouncing your favorite character's name incorrectly.  Might be easier if I were Australian(like the author). That aside, Kyralia and Imardin are wonderfully deep in detail.  After you've read the books through once, you almost don't need the maps that are provided.  The characters, while stronger than most of the others, are not perfect or constantly rescued in some improbable or unimaginable way.  Lastly, the magic system isn't overly hard to grasp.  This makes it easier to get lost in the story without getting bogged down in the mechanics like so many other books lately. I highly recommend this book and the rest of the trilogy.",

         "I agree with the opinion of other reviewers that \"The Magician's Guild\" lacks enough material to make for a book (and the rest of the story is not enough to make a trilogy). This work is, and reads like, a first-time novel for a debuting author. Canavan has restricted herself to staying within the generally accepted and widely used boundaries of fantasy work: medievalism, magicians and thieves. The story is a coming-of-age of Sonea, a slum girl who accidentally unleashes her magical powers when she and a group of friends try to obstruct the work of the Magician's Guild who are purging all the poor from the city. They throw rocks that bounce off the invisible barrier held up by the magicians. Except that Sonea's rock gets through when she wills it to, and strikes the temple of Lord Fergun. Mass confusion ensues among the magicians, and they end up accidentally killing a boy standing near Sonea. Sonea herself is confused by what's happened to her. She runs and hides from the magicians who have identified her magical potential. The problem is, the longer she hides, the less controllable her magic becomes and the more destruction she creates to those around her. Even the Thieves are unable to protect her. Inevitably, Sonea ends up at the Magician's Guild. The book tells the tale of how Sonea ends up at the Guild, and her apprenticeship. The plot focuses around the High Lord (the one that rules the Guild), whom Sonea accidentally observes practicing black magic. She and a few others who know about this, lie in wait but know that eventually they must do something about the High Lord. Meanwhile, Sonea is often troubled by Regis, a school bully, since she is the only slum girl in a school full of upper class students. The details of Sonea's tough existence, frankly, are boring. This book comes in two parts, but in my opinion, they needed to be edited down to a quarter of a book. Books two and three could have formed the rest of the book. As one piece, the work would have been snazzy, snappy and sweet. As a trilogy, it is drawn out and somewhat stilted, suffering from too much information of banal aspects of the characters' lives that are of no interest to the reader. However, it does have its merits. This book might interest some younger readers or those whose interest in fantasy are exclusively to magic. Once into the story, it becomes easier to ignore the glaring rawness of the writing. Happily, Canavan obviously becomes more comfortable with her characters, and the second and third book flow more easily than this one, although trite details still poke through excessively. The story, nevertheless, becomes more interesting, and because of this, it deserves three starts.",

Sandstorm like all of his previous works is a fast paced, action packed adventure that takes to fabulous locations and keeps the action moving.  This is the best Rollins book yet and it is sure to please. Sandstorm begins in England, and after a mysterious murder, an artifact is found inside an ancient statute.  It leads to a race in the desert between two groups searching for the lost city of UBAR. The story leads of a fact paced, and exciting finish that will have you on the edge of your seat turned each page faster and faster.  The writing takes you into the desert and you can feel the Sandstorm heading towards you.  If you are looking to be transported away for a fun filled journey, this is the book for you! Along the way there are the normal twists and turns that keep you wanting more.  Some in the past have said there was not enough character development in Rollins' books, but this time, I think there is just enough.  You get to know what is driving the characters and can see why they are doing the things that they are. This is a great book for that summer weekend at the beach or just sitting out on your front porch!  Fans of Rollins will love this new book, and if you are a first time reader of Rollins, I am sure that you will be hooked.  I HIGHLY recommend Sandstorm by James Rollins!",

The first part really drew me in, mainly due to Gaimans writing skill.  Shadows time in prison and his release were intensely interesting.  Then things started falling apart for me. Im not a fan of dream sequences or other hallucinogenic/semi-reality scenes, and there were TONS in this book. Im not a fan of things that would give a movie an R rating, and there were TONS in this book. Im not a fan of long descriptions, and there were TONS in this book. And, for heavens sake, I know theres a war coming.  You don't have to tell me five hundred times. I AM a fan of the overall concept:  immigrants bringing gods with them, the gods losing power as faith wanes, etc.  I found some of the god characters really interesting, and some of the back stories fascinating.  However, I felt that the book wandered too much to really execute the premise well. Terry Pratchett brilliantly addressed this general theme in Small Gods, and did it with charm and humor and a PG rating.  If you weren't quite satisfied with American Gods, try Pratchetts take. Back to American Gods: I enjoyed some of the endless parade of quirky characters that often just disappeared after their scenes.  They were interesting, and it wasn't a problem that they disappeared.  It was when they re-appeared 400 pages later, and I couldn't remember how they fit in, that it became a problem. I think my favorite parts, besides the first, were the times spent in small-town Lakeside.  I absolutely loved the stories Hinzelman told.  Gaiman certainly has an imagination.  Of course, Hinzelmans later plot seemed a little out of place.  Still, I liked that whole part of the book, and found myself wishing it took up a larger percentage of the novel. Anyway, I think Gaiman is talented, and he brought up some really interesting concepts.  I even highlighted some fantastic passages.  Heres one: Religions are, by definition, metaphors, after all: God is a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father.even, perhaps, against all evidence, a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrive, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition. The book in its entirety just wasn't to my taste, and could have benefited from some more ruthless editing. Warning:  Explicit (and unnecessary) sex scenes and references.

         "\"This book is the last in A Series of Unfortunate Events, and even if you braved the previous twelve volumes, you probably can't stand such unpleasantries as a fearsome storm, a suspicious beverage, a herd of wild sheep, an enormous bird cage, and a truly haunting secret about the Baudelaire parents.\" A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS number thirteen is the last in this series, as would be imagined by the title. In this one, the Baudelaire orphans pick up where they left off in The Penultimate Peril: In the same boat as their enemy Count Olaf in more ways than one. Basic outline of the book and plot spoilers ahead. The book begins with the Baudelaires and Count Olaf in a boat together. Olaf orders the Baudelaires around and clutches a harpoon gun and a helmet full of poisonous fungus. The Baudelaires wonder whether to push Olaf overboard as he leans over the side of the boat to pull off the \"Carmelita\" label to reveal a \"Count Olaf\" label. A storm hits. The boat washes up on a coastal shelf. Everyone has survived, and Olaf continues to order the orphans around as they walk around the shelf. A young girl named Friday greets them, and since the Baudelaires are polite, they are invited to the island which is her home, but since Olaf keeps claiming to be their king and threatens Friday with the harpoon gun, she tells him to go away. The orphans get led to the island and are offered coconut cordial, which tastes strange and sweet. They meet Ishmael, the island's facilitator, and then they are told to put on white robes like everyone else and give away all their possessions. Klaus is allowed to keep his glasses, but otherwise they have to hide what they're each keeping: Violet hides her ribbon, Klaus hides his commonplace book, and Sunny hides her egg whisk. The islanders go through the usual custom of sorting through anything that had washed up on the beach during the storm. Ishmael rejects just about everything except nets and blankets, and has some sheep drag the items away. During this, many islanders are named, and they all have one thing in common: Their names have been used in some story or myth about the sea or islands. After that, the orphans are given food they don't like and their own seashell canteens full of coconut cordial, and the islanders drink a toast to the children. But Ishmael refers to them as orphans even though they haven't told him their story . . . which makes them very suspicious about how much this man knows. The Baudelaires find their places on the island: Violet helps with the laundry, Klaus helps pile clay on Ishmael's ailing feet and refills his cordial canteen, and Sunny helps with the cooking. They discuss their past and what they miss, and decide they both like and dislike living on the island. Their peace comes to an end when a weird craft made out of strapped-together books arrives, carrying Kit Snicket . . . and Count Olaf, who is disguised as usual. Olaf, in a seaweed wig pretending to be the pregnant Kit Snicket, tries to fool the islanders, but unlike every other time in the books, every single person sees through his disguise. They decide to put him in a cage that washed up in the last storm, and they abandon him with the books he rode in on and Kit Snicket. But because Olaf announced that Sunny was hiding a whisk in her robe, Ishmael found out what each of them hid, and decided to abandon THEM as well. Abandoned, the kids sit with only a snake (the Incredibly Deadly Viper from book 2), an unconscious friend, and Count Olaf to keep them company. They discover that Ishmael had been eating apples (as evidenced by an apple core that fell out of his robe), and thus realize he's being selfish and untruthful about his feet being hurt. Olaf offers to share a plan and information if they will let him out of the cage, but they go out of his sight and think about their choices. Olaf falls asleep and the Baudelaires keep thinking. Soon enough, Kit Snicket wakes up and is happy to see them (and their snake), but is disappointed to hear that Dewey is not with them. (The Baudelaires decide not to tell her that he was harpooned in the last book.) Two islanders--Finn and Erewhon--approach the orphans and bring them all onion soup, and they reveal that they are tired of Ishmael and are planning a mutiny--a schism. The Baudelaires are talked into helping invent and build weapons for this mutiny in return for promised help for the injured, pregnant, and distraught Kit. The Baudelaires arrive at the arboretum where all the rejected items end up, and they quickly fall in love with the place. Their snake shows them a secret passageway under the roots of a tree, and there they discover an odd room. The siblings reclaim their lost items and discover new ones, and discuss using peer pressure instead of weapons to get rid of Ishmael. Then they discover a diary-like history of the island, and just as they realize it mentions Kit Snicket and contains some of their mother's handwriting, Ishmael arrives. Ishmael claims he knew the Baudelaires would come to this place because it was \"in their blood\" to do so--he knew their parents, and revealed that they had lived on the island once too. But they had been forced to leave, and Ishmael claims that the children were never told the sad history of their parents because the parents didn't want them to know; they'd wanted them to be shielded from the unfortunate events of the world instead of adding their own chapter to the book. Ishmael wants them to abandon their lives and live simply according to the island's rules, because it's what their parents would have wanted. The island sheep drag Ishmael and the Baudelaires back to the island, where a mutiny is already in progress. Ishmael supporters are fighting with people who want to overthrow him. Everyone starts voicing their suggestions, and then Count Olaf--still wearing a dress with a false pregnancy--wanders in and challenges Ishmael, at which point it is revealed that Ishmael was part of V.F.D. as well and has a secret history with Olaf. In order to end things once and for all, Ishmael fires the harpoon gun at Olaf's belly . . . where he is hiding a helmet full of poisonous fungus. Everyone, including Olaf, is exposed to the poison. Ishmael expects everyone to sip coconut cordial and think about their situation, but the Baudelaires know from experience that the fungus will kill them within an hour, so they race off to the arboretum to find a solution. There is no horseradish or wasabi in the kitchen, so they try reading their parents' record, which clues them in that the apple tree above them is a hybrid tree that produces bitter apples. They cure themselves by eating one of the apples. The Baudelaires rush to try to save everyone with more apples, but the colonists are already leaving on a boat as the coastal shelf floods. Ishmael has convinced them that the coconut cordial will save them (though drinking it has just made them stupid), and they refuse to take any more help from the Baudelaires because they perceive that they are the cause of this mess. Their snake goes after the boat with an apple, so there is a possibility that they might have survived, but that is left open. In the meantime, the orphans must help Kit Snicket give birth. She has also been poisoned by the fungus, but won't take an apple because it will harm her baby. Count Olaf appears, also poisoned, and the Baudelaires convince him to do one good thing in his life and carry the pregnant woman to a safe place so she can give birth. He actually does so--and kisses Kit in the process!--but even though he eats an apple and cures his fungus infection too, there is a wound in his chest from the harpoon, and he dies. So does Kit. And the Baudelaires name her daughter after their mother, and raise her on the island, with all the devices and information in the arboretum to help them. An unprecedented chapter fourteen epilogue shows the Baudelaires a year later, having raised the baby girl and perused the island's history (also called \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\"). They add verses to the book themselves and explore the collection of wonderful devices, books, and kitchen implements, but then decide to depart when the coastal shelf floods again. Off they go with plenty of food and entertainment, in the vessel they came in. They pull off the nameplate that read \"Count Olaf\" and see that the boat was originally named Beatrice . . . which is also their mother's name and the new baby's name. That answers a lot of questions, but we still don't know what was in the sugar bowl, who lived and who died in various disasters (including the older Baudelaires' love interests and some former guardians), and what happened to them after they rejoined the world.",

         "This book is such a fun read, even those who don't crave random trivia can enjoy it!  It has so much information, and yet is so organized that you can actually find the information!  While I don't subscribe to this magazine, reading this book will make anybody consider getting a subscription.  All in all, there is really nothing but positive things I can say about this book. Several reviewers have criticized some of the ways information is presented in this book for the sake of political correctness, as well as some of the opinions about works discussed.  I think all the reviewers of this book make valid points.  Everybody knows what AD and BC mean, there's really no reason at this point to reinvent the wheel. The section on Art included a few prickly elements for me.  I personally was annoyed by some of the superlatives used to describe many of the artists.  The section on seeming like you know what you're talking about at an art exhibit is so funny, however, that it totally makes up for it.  :)  In all fairness, art is one of the hardest things to write about clearly since it's so personal for whoever is viewing it.  Look up the artists listed so that you can see some of the pictures yourself and make up your own mind! Those small picadillos aside, there's sooo much to enjoy here that the good far outweighs the bad.  The sections are well organized, and the authors do a great job of bringing historical figures to life with great stories. Many trivia books can be read for about an hour at a time. This is a trivia book that can be read for hours on end and still not make you feel overloaded.  The bite-size bits of info are easy for anybody to swallow! All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this book.  If it were possible to give it 6 stars I would!  Buy it, Read it, ENJOY IT!",

         "Deftly juggling four separate plot lines, Michael Gruber's challenging mystery focuses on Emmy Lou Dideroff, a woman with a checkered past, who has been a postulant in a religious nursing order.  Found in the Miami hotel room of a Sudanese oil merchant who has just been pushed out of a tenth floor window, Emily is talking earnestly  with St. Catherine of Siena when the police arrive, willing to confess to a murder of which she may be innocent because \"it would be an honor to be executed unjustly, like Jesus.\" Tito Morales, the first officer on the scene, soon becomes the partner of Iago Xavier (Jimmy) Paz, another Cuban-American police officer and a main character in Gruber's previous novel, Tropic of Night.  Their relationship with Major Oliphant, formerly with the FBI, and with other federal agencies, as the investigation unfolds, constitutes another subplot, as roadblocks are constantly erected by both the Department of Justice and the FBI. Lorna Wise, the psychologist in charge of Emmy Lou's competency hearing, becomes her therapist/advocate, and it is to Lorna that Emmy Lou's \"confession\" in a series of notebooks is addressed.  Though Lorna herself is not religious, she feels an inexplicable connection to Emmy Lou, and the reader soon discovers that Lorna has problems of her own.  Throughout the novel, historical information is interjected about the Nursing Sisters of The Blood of Christ, the religious order in which Emmu Lou Dideroff was a postulant, and about its founder, Marie-Ange de Berville. As the investigation moves from Miami to the Sudan, Gruber provides detailed information about the anthropology of the Dinka tribe in Sudan, the ethnographic conflicts which have threatened them with extinction, their powers of magic and sorcery, and the mystical connections they have with their surroundings, calling into play issues far greater than those of the local murder investigation. Gruber keeps the reader interested, not only in the story but in the unfolding characterizations and interrelationships of his offbeat characters.  By withholding key information about them, the author keeps the interest high, further ratcheting up the suspense through the complexities of the plot, with its increasing mayhem.  Not just a shoot-'em-up, this mystery novel raises fascinating questions about psychology, religious mania, and responsibility, and as the threads come together in the conclusion (and somehow they all do), the tight construction and careful plotting pay off with a blockbuster resolution.

         "American Gods follows Shadow on his journey.  It starts out with Shadow in prison, soon to be released.  On the eve of his release, he finds out his wife (Laura) has just died and that he's getting released early.  Shadow travels back home for his wife's funeral.  Along the way, he encounters Mr. Wednesday, who acts oddly and seems to know more about Shadow than he should.  Shadow tries to ditch Mr. Wednesday, only to have him turn up again like a bad penny.  It seems Mr. Wednesday wants to hire Shadow to work for him.  After several drinks of mead, Shadow agrees.  The work mostly entails driving Mr. Wednesday around, and, should he die, holding a vigil for him.  Slowly Shadow realizes there is more to Mr. Wednesday than he imagined.  Known by many other names, Odin is the most prominent, a God.  Odin and Shadow travel America searching out others to help them in the upcoming war.  Gods originally arrived in America via the belief of the people who traveled to America.  Over time, belief in Gods has wained and been replaced by technology and cultural fads.  Lack of belief weakens them and has caused many of the American Gods to lead a life of mere existence rather than the life enjoyed in their glory days. This was an interesting read.  Not really like the other works I've read by Gaiman, but his stamp is still on it.  I liked coming to the realization of who the various Gods were as Shadow was drawing the same conclusions.  I must admit, I was slow on the uptake and didn't realize who one was until the very end (though this was as intended since that's when Shadow realizes it as well).  I think in the end, I was hoping for a bit more fantasy or supernatural elements, thus the 4 star rating instead of 5.  The supernatural elements were there (we are talking about Gods after all), but they were underplayed and supplemental versus the main focus.  The story really is about Shadow's journey. Some good quotes: \"Every hour wounds.  The last one kills.\" \"Shadow had heard too many people telling each other not to repress their feelings, to let their emotions out, let the pain go.  Shadow thought there was a lot to be said for bottling up emotions.  If you did it long enough and deep enough, he suspected, pretty soon you wouldn't feel anything at all.\" \"...a town isn't a town without a bookstore.  It may call itself a town, but unless it's got a bookstore, it knows it's not fooling a soul.\" \"Fiction allows us to slide into these other heads, these other places, and look out through other eyes.  And then in the tale we stop before we die, or we die vicariously and unharmed, and in the world beyond the tale we turn the page or close the book, and we resume our lives.\" \"You people talk about the living and the dead as if they were two mutually exclusive categories.  As if you can not have a river that is also a road, or a song that is also a color.\" \"He wondered whether home was a thing that happened to a place after a while, or if it was something that you found in the end, if you simply walked and waited and willed it long enough.\"",

There's very little actual exploration of the gods the book advertises. Most of the book is split between the main character, Shadow's, inner musings and an exploration of the America countryside. Unfortunately neither of these things are particularly interesting. Shadow is about as engaging as a blank wall, he reacts to every fantastical thing with utter disinterest. The road trip aspect is also incredibly boring. Very little time is actually spent with the various gods, and that time is underutilized.

         3,
         "but a definitely superior product. [For me, five stars is a rarely attainable maximum, the one that only the \"hundred you'd take to the desert island where you're marooned\" get, so I'm somewhat restricted in my four-stars awards. If Amazon's rating system allowed it, I'd give \"Valley of Bones\" (\"VoB\") 3+ stars]. The plot is aptly summarized both in Amazon's ed rev, and in Gail Cooke's and Kay Day's excellent and more detailed ones (with which I agree), so I won't repeat it here. Obviously, Gruber has taken the trouble to read widely on the subject. He's also able to invent a very ingenious and very complicated, many-layered story (you'll savour it more if you read it twice, as on a first perusal it seems less plausible than when you know the ending, and the second time, page-turning urgency gone, you pay more attention to the details), full of twists wound around a theme told at two different levels, let's call them naturalistic and numinous to simplify. His most risky character, the nun, is well portrayed (I actually have a couple of female Catholic friends that, while quite lower on the \"fundamentalist sanctity\" scale, could conceivably hold the same beliefs and attitudes). The epiphany is very convincing and masterfully depicted: when she shouts \"filthy filthy ... !\", for example, you feel it could have been taken from a real experience, and is actually quite a respectable attempt to reconstruct and repeat -with a difference- a historical episode (I'm sorry to be so vague, but otherwise I'd be giving away too many details of a scene that merits to be read by \"virgin\" minds). This numinous level version is also more believable than that of ToN, perhaps because its main episodes are placed before the end, and so the denouement is much more rational and \"whodunitic\". The other two main characters are also tolerably well depicted, although less so than the nun's (Paz and his mother are, as in ToN, two cliched Cubans, while Dr. Wise is, at least at the beginning, a bit of a Woody-Allenish caricature, not really suited to the mood of the book). Miami and Florida are described rather well, the city's and its police's corrupted atmosphere coming through more believably, and in a less annoying language, than, say, in Stone's \"King of Swords\". The African part is superb, sounding both matter-of-fact and exotic. I'm not qualified to judge whether the account of Garigeau's/Dideroff's infancy in Florida and teenhood in Blue Ridge with the white supremacist philosopher and drug dealer Orne (IMO one of the least plausible of the book's characters) is believable. For me, it was the least interesting part of the novel, and the most contrived (I mean, really, could there be people so crime-prone that don't get caught?). The writing is vivid, and there are four distinct narrations in different styles: I would say a virtuoso performance (I assume the first parts of the Order's history are written to parodize some Saints' bios). All in all, I would say that IMO, for somewhat intellectual tastes, this should the best thriller (if it can at all be confined to that genre, although I think it trascends it) around. Why then not four stars? For two main reasons: (1) The book is essentially the same as ToN (although of course with different personages except the here almost monogamous Paz, and Barlow, and their families; different type of numen involved -although there's some Santera as well, but it's secondary-; different African setting; much more \"international\" and ramified plot; slightly different and more believable story development, as already noted above); in particular, the modes of description of the epiphanies, although with different meanings and actors, are almost identical. (2) The resolution is implausible. CAUTION: PERHAPS LIGHT SPOILER AHEAD! For example, how did the perps know Emily would fall into a trance and so be conveniently around when Paz entered the suite? More basic, how did they know Morales and Paz would be the cops who first arrived? Different ones might have acted differently. LIGHT SPOILER ENDED. Or, is it believable that a Government psychiatrist could spirit away a patient interned by a judge in a Gov hospital, without neither consequences nor investigation into the disappearance? There are other examples of not very credible situations in the novel (a one-legged, or at least with only one foot, person parachuting? Etc.). (3) Also, although this is a minor quibble, the book must have been finished in a rush: there are some verb tense confusions (especially in Lorna's part, which is told in the present tense), and some negatives are missing from Emmylou's (or else some sentences would have no meaning). To conclude: VoB is a four-star book if you aren't acquainted with Gruber's ToN, a three-star one atherwise. Eminently worth reading in any case. I won't however buy the third Paz volume.",

         "If you are interested in book reviews that have happy endings, you would be better off reading some other review. Because this review, like so many others, is more likely to make you hide in your cellar than prompt you to give your credit card number to complete strangers to order a copy of \"The End.\" Unfortunately, like other series of books that start out splendidly, a word which here means \"with interesting characters and fascinating plots,\" the last book in the chronicle of the Baudelaire's lives ends not with a bang but a whimper. The phrase \"not with a bang but a whimper\" was penned by a man named Thomas, who was a close associate of mine until he left one day for New Guinea in a generically-fueled speed boat, all because of a note left in a cookie jar by a hotel concierge. The exact meaning of the phrase is ambiguous to some and downright confusing to others, but to my way of thinking, the best manner in which to use \"not with a bang but a whimper\" is in reference to an entertaining series of books that end not with plot resolution but with more unanswered questions. Unfortunately, that is how \"The End\" ends - with more unfortunate happenings that leave the unfortunate reader with the unfortunate sensation of having unfortunately wasted his or her time reading an unfortunate ending, unfortunately. That brings me to a problem that plagues the whole series of unfortunate events, and that is the repetitive nature of the books, a word which here means \"Lemony Snicket deems it necessary to repeat the same sentence structure and subtle jokes ad infinitum throughout the series.\" This literary technique, a word which here means \"way of writing a book,\" is novel the first few times it is tried, but after reading through 170 chapters filled with repetitive phrases, a word which here means \"the same phrases over and over again,\" one tends to become disinterested, a word which here means \"bored,\" or downright angry, a word which here means \"why am I reading this book?\" Mr. Snicket's stories also tend to fall into abject pessimism, a which here means \"a depressing view of the world,\" which might make good reading for hermits and old maids but not high-spirited little children. If you have read this much of my review - which I certainly hope you have not - then you must be wondering what redeeming qualities Lemony Snicket's unfortunate series of unfortunate books may have. While it is true that \"The End\" leaves one whimpering, it is equally untrue that the series should not be read. Books one through 11 are quite entertaining, a word which here means \"worthy of being read.\" Unfortunately, Mr. Snicket begins to wax philosophical in the two closing books of the series. By \"wax philosophical\" I do not mean that Mr. Snicket uses a putrid smelling and oily substance to buff and shine his automobile, which he has nicknamed \"philosophical.\" Rather, \"wax philosophical\" means that Mr. Snicket attempts to examine the nature of good and evil, often with rather embarrassing results. Mr. Snicket's liberal views on politics, morality, religion, and \"pelosi\" (a word which, when translated, means \"his choice to live in San Francisco rather than Vermillion, South Dakota\") may be interesting in a debate, but they serve as a mere annoyance in a children's yarn. That being said, the first eleven books are entertaining and enjoyable, words which here mean \"worthy of being read, even if the last two books are horrid.\" There are some books, of course, that are better left unread, and I am sorry to say that \"The End\" is one of those. While it is wise to avoid \"The End,\" it is definitely unwise to avoid many of the other books in the series. So, if you can look past the repetitive prose and odd humor, pick up the first few books in the series, but expecting a decent resolution to the storyline would be an unfortunate event indeed.",

It's more like James Lee Burke and John LeCarre. It's an excellent novel but like those one in a thousand novels, it asks the reader to work as hard as the writer. The benefits of the story won't come to you unless you're willing to role up your sleeves. Like LeCarre, Michael Gruber makes the reader commit to effort. Jimmy Paz is a pretty boy. He gets to wear $1000 dollar suits because he is just that. He's well cut and he wants his suits to be well cut. He demands that of his new partner, Tito Morales, a rookie cop called to a Miami Hotel over a disturbance. The disturbance? 'One of the guests tried to fly,' he tells Paz when Jimmy rolls in . . . 'from the tenth floor.' Paz is promiscuous. He's a gigolo without the capital \"G.\" Oh yeah, and he has a violent, violent temper. Oh yeah. One other thing. He cuffs himself to his bed because he walks in his sleep. Lorna Wise is a psychologist, a state employee by choice, a PhD who doesn't want the exposure of private practice. As full of himself as Paz is she's an empty sack, sleeping with married men and collegues, ashamed of her body (which ain't bad, we are told) and ashamed of herself, outside and in. She's a mess. Oh yeah. She thinks she's doomed to die. Soon. She makes 'acute hypochondria' sound as simple as an ad for Johnson & Johnson bandaids. These are interesting people but they're Booster Club Moms and Dads compared to Emmylou Dideroff, drug dealer, revolutionary, hooker, nun, ecstatic, and frequent conversationalist with saints. Deceased saints. Here's just a note from the mouth of Emmylou: \"What passes as goodness between us fallen human beings is generally not more than a mutual picking of lice from our fur, and a suspension of our desire to eat eachother up. It is only social goodness.\" How do you get to meet these three people? Well, Mike Gruber weaves a troika of stories. First there's the History of The Sisters of The Blood of Christ. Then there's the confessions of Emmylou Dideroff, as she writes them over the course of four notebooks imprisoned in a state mental hospital for the murder of the flyer. Seems evidence points to his takeoff as being non volitional. Oh. Would you like to guess who is her therapist? And then of course is the murder mystery itself which by now has graduated to a multiple murder mystery. One last point. Lee Burke mentioned earlier and John Connolly both have characters who speak to the dead. This is occasionally unrealistic and awkward. Gruber pulls this off seamlessly.

         "I enjoyed all the early books in this series through Book 11.  After reading Book 12 (\"The Penultimate Peril\") I had reserved judgment.  Though less enjoyable in its own right, it might possibly justify itself if it became apparent, in retrospect, that it was building up to something worth while. Not so.  \"The End\" fails so badly, that not only does it drag \"The Penultimate Peril\" into the abyss along with it, but it also detracts from most of the other entries.  Many of the late entries in the series varied intriguingly from formula in a manner that seemed to promise that they were part of something more than a somewhat repetitive series of stand-alone adventures.  This promise has been exposed as a lie.  It is here revealed that there was no real build-up, no over-arching story line, and no real plan.  The \"clues\" thrown out to create an aura of mystery were never really clues -- just a sort of increasingly-unfunny comic schtick.  None of those little mysteries he builds up in the early volumes will be resolved here.  Some of the early stories perhaps still hold up well enough as stand-alone adventures, but they were never ever more than that. Perhaps it was only to be expected that, since Book 12 offered us a \"denouement\" that was not really a denouement (even according to his careful explanations of the meaning of the word), this final book would give us an \"End\" that was not really an End. The series just fizzles out in a miasma of despair that no longer seems to be a joke (and which, in any event, has certainly ceased to be funny).  This, unfortunately, includes moral despair.  Over the course of the last few volumes, the author has torn down the distinction between hero and villain (in a preachy and heavy handed manner) while still clearly expecting us to retain full sympathy for the heroes.  The unmistakeable message is that growing up necessarily involves abandonment of one's moral principles, as one prepares to survive in a hostile world.  So, essentially, not only does he himself cop out on resolving the plot, but he is also advocating moral cowardice to his child readers. Do not mistake Snicket's moral despair for moral sophistication.  The series never beomes \"morally complex\" -- it never begins to approach even the moral complexity of the Harry Potter books.  Snicket does not advocate a complex moral code; he merely suggests that, since a simple one does not work, we should join him in wringing our hands (presumably as a prelude to washing them of responsibility).  Snicket's outlook is so morally unsophisticated that, in his zeal to equate heros and villains, he at one point ignores the distinction between intentional murder and an accident. The Baudelaire children are left, finally, with only their elitism to console themselves.  Even if they, too, have become \"villains\" like Count Olaf, at least they are still special in the sense that they are still smarter, prettier, and generally superior to the surging masses of stupid ugly humanity. Meanwhile, as plot and morality slide into the abyss, we begin to detect the ugly stench of Allegory amidst the chaos.  My suspicions of allegorical intent were horribly confirmed when Sunny uttered a certain word beginning with \"D\".  I will say no more of this, if you dislike allegory as much as I usually do, such revelations are bound to spoil any enjoyment of even the earlier books. I did get a couple of chuckles from Snicket's usual word-play.  Though few and far between, these moments of amusement have nonetheless inspired me to give this book 2 stars rather than the minimum of 1.",

         "This is one of the finest accounts of a military campaign that I've ever read. Carlo D'este is a fabulous military historian. D'este has done something very rare, which is simply to tell the story of a major battle,from the generals' arguments to the crazed, terrifying stories from the soldiers crouching in holes in the ground. Anzio was an operation which had already been considered and rejected. D'este shows that the responsibility for this disaster rests almost entirely upon Winston Churchill, who single-handedly rescued the battle plans from the trash and placed them on the drawing board. Unfortunately, Churchill didn't provide any solutions to the weaknesses of the plan; instead he used sleight of hand to make it appear that the plan would work and bullied his subordinates into accepting it. Most American readers are unaware of the damage that Churchill did to the Allied cause. Although he was a brilliant and essential political leader, he'd always yearned to be a successful commander in the field, and his wish to be a military hero blinded him and prevented him from listening to better qualified men and led him to drag England, and the Allies, into spectacular mistakes like the campaigns in Greece and in Norway. Although his \"soft underbelly\" argument, which led to the tragic and costly Italian campaign, made sense-surely the Americans and British had to do something to help while the Russians fought the Germans-one wonders whether the invasion of Italy ever justified the titanic casualties which it caused. The foreseeable stalemate on mainland Italy led logically to Operation Shingle, the landings at Anzio. D'este shows that, beyond landing the troops, Allied leadership had no real idea of what they wanted to accomplish there. Something about Italy...Churchill wasn't the only bad leader the Alllies relied on there. Mark Clark,commander of the Fifth Army,had a titanic ego and gradually came to mistrust and hate his English counterparts. One story,which D'este repeats,has him threatening to have US troops fire on any English soldiers who attempt to enter Rome ahead of the Americans. A great deal of this book is spent putting the campaign in context and in telling the stories of the men who fought at Anzio. Unlike many historians D'este has no difficulty moving back and forth between the Big Picture and the story of the poor bastard who's crouched in a ditch, terrified and praying that the enemy troops go around his position. D'este is certainly one of the finest American historian when it comes to the Mediterranean Theatre and this is his finest book.",

         5,
         "Since the passing of the late Stephen Ambrose, Carlo D'Este has probably assumed the mantle of America's leading World War II historian and author. This work was his fourth dealing with military events in the European theater (and in this case, the third dealing with the Mediterranean). You probably won't find a better, more detailed account of the Anzio battle than in this book. It's well researched, very detailed and a quick moving read. I gathered that D'Este believed that the Allies weren't all that allied and the Germans, outnumbered and outsupplied, simply took advantage of Allied mistakes and blunders and nearly made \"Operation Shingle\" a total disaster. D'Este clearly admires Mark Clark's bravery, but questions his strategic abilities. He finds Alexander personally likeable, but one of the least decisive theater commanders of the war and Kesselring, daring, resourceful and opportunistic. The General he admires most is without a doubt, Lucian K. Truscott Jr, first commander of the famous U. S. Third Infantry Division, then is elevated to 6th Corps command when Lucas is relieved. The way the author marshalls his facts, you will find it hard to disagree. But to me, the hero of the book is the ordinary land soldier, the men who endured the barbarous fighting, the nightmarish stalemate and the eventual breakout of the beachhead. This is a superb piece of military history and well worth the time it will take to read it.",

D'Este skillfully combines detailed historical analysis with interesting first hand accounts.  The result is a highly readable book.  The author uses the first several chapters to set the scene and explain the historical significance of the operation.  There are extended passages on the conflicts between the Allied commanders.  The central section of the book describes the actual conduct of the operation.  The chapters cover the battle at the tactical level and include many short personnel stories.  The author moves easily from strategic conflicts between Allied generals to the day-to-day struggle of the infantrymen in the mud of Anzio.  The author is not afraid to state an opinion and all views are backed up by significant evidence.  This makes the work more than just a collection of war stories.  The only quirk I found was D'este obvious admiration of German generals and the German military in general.  While he goes to great length to point out the weakness of Allied leadership, the Germans are let off rather lightly, despite the fact that in the end they lost.",

         "Okay, the title is going to make people giggle or cringe. But \"Sex With Kings: 500 Years of Adultery, Power, Rivalry and Revenge\" is a genuinely engrossing book, full of funny and tragic stories about royal mistresses through history. From Madame de Pompadour to Camilla Parker-Bowles, Eleanor Hermann studies these controversial -- sometimes fascinating -- women. There are mistresses of all types: married and single, noble and low-born, beautiful and ugly, smart and stupid. Some befriended the queens, some attacked (and were attacked by) them. Some died alone and unhappy, some became nuns, and some lived in luxury to the end. Some were sweet and pious, and some were nightmares. Hermann studies why the kings got involved with these women, and how brains and sweet natures could mean a lot more than a pretty face. They could (sometimes) influence politics, succession, and their illegitimate children were sometimes better-loved than the king's legitimate kids. The mistresses themselves are a colorful bunch, from the bratty, grasping Lola Montez, bawdy Nell Gwynn, pious Louise, and the legendary Madame de Pompadour. One of the most memorable is the grasping Madame de Montespan, who used black magic to ensnare the king, only to eventually drive him into the arms of a \"batlike\" governess. Yes, it's called \"Sex with Kings.\" But it's not all about sex -- in fact, it becomes clear that sex is only one factor. Hermann does a pretty good job of studying all angles of mistresshood. Sure, a mistress sometimes got the prettiest dresses and jewels, but she could be kicked out on a whim. There were dozens of setbacks, and only a very wily mistress could avoid them. The author also devotes attention to the mistress's children, her lover the king, and sometimes the mistress's husband. Even the unfortunate queen gets a chapter, as well as the occasional mistress who married the king. But Hermann keeps it funny and light as well. One particularly funny story is of a plain German princess and a French transvestite prince -- both of whom ask how they can possibly sleep with the other. But she doesn't avoid the touchier issues of mistresses either, like the religious or political angles. Nor does she cater to double standards by blaming either the kings or mistresses. Hermann finishes up the book on a promising note, pointing out recent marriages between royal men and the title-less women they love. But even if mistresshood is a thing of the past, the unique story of these women is well mapped-out in \"Sex With Kinds.\" A fun and unique read.",

         3,
         "In Sex With Kings, a companion volume to Sex With The Queen, Eleanor Herman sheds light on royal men and the mistresses they took. At least in part, the implication is that royal men took mistresses not only because they wanted to, but to demonstrate to their courts that they were virile and vigorous. An overactive sex drive was (and to a certain extent, continues to be) an expected trait in men, and the king was supposed to be the manliest man of all. But the services that a royal mistress was to provide went far beyond sex (look no further than Madame de Pompadour, whose sexual relationship with King Louis XV ended long before her reign as royal mistress ended): she was to provide pleasant companionship to the King whenever he wanted it. That meant being available at all times, never being snappy or rude (although some mistresses were famous for quick tempers, most were not), never complaining of any inconvenience. They were rewarded with fancy rooms in the palace, titles, and estates, but those could be stripped when a new favorite was installed, so the smart ones got jewels and cash. This book was actually published prior to Sex With The Queen, and I think Herman learned from her issues with Sex With Kings in writing the second book. While the structure is fairly similar (a topic, like the children of mistresses, is the focus of each chapter and various examples are highlighted to illustrate it), Sex With The Queen also took a deeper dive into a few stories, like Catherine the Great, and told them straight through. I think that approach was ultimately more successful than the one used in this book, which has a few women to whom it constantly returns (Madame de Pompadour, Madame du Barry, Louise de Keroualle, Lady Castlemaine, and Lola Montez are particular favorites). You don't really get a sense of the full scope of these women's lives as their stories get told piecemeal, and it can get confusing to try to keep them and all their details straight. I found myself having to flip back, try to remember which king they were attached to, who their rivals and predecessors were, what country and era they lived in. Along with the issues with the way in which the stories were told, Herman's fondness for cheesy physical description gets a little eye-roll-y at times. The women seem to uniformly have \"cascading hair\", \"sparkling eyes\", and a \"dazzling complexion\". I like that she's trying to make the mistresses and their lives and struggles feel contemporary and real instead of something out of a stuffy history book, but I think their stories are compelling enough without the gushy language. That all being said, these are interesting stories and ones which we don't usually come across. Herman does a good job of shedding light on details we might not usually think about when it comes to how these women's lives actually played out behind the scenes, and this would be a great starter book if you're interested in this kind of thing, like I am, and want to get ideas about biographies you'd like to explore. I'd heard of Madame de Pompadour before, and the information in this book was definitely enough to make me interested in reading more about her!",

It's intersting that some mistresses, such as Madame Pompadour who ran the Seven Years War, shaped history. Others were fostered on the king so as to gain political influence such as Louise de Keroualle from France who was mistress to Charles II, basically she was a pawn of the king of France and tried to influence Charles II.

After thinking it over, I'm pretty sure I know who Beatrice is; Handler (Snicket) seems to spell this out explicitly via a number of clues that are spread through the entire series. I'm also pretty sure that Count Olaf didn't start the fire that orphaned the Baudelaires, and that this fire was actually set by a most unexpected source. In other words, it may be that the entire series, especially this book, provides all we need to understand all the mysteries. But digging out the information takes work.

Herman decided to group her chapters around various themes, such as the rivalry between the queen and the king's mistress, or the husband of the king's mistress, the riches to be obtained as the king's mistress, the potential political power that might be obtained, the issue of royal bastards, public opinion of the mistress, and the change of winds that occur when the king dies before his mistress. This would appear to be a very sensible way to organize the chapters, however it also means that each chapter is full of small paragraphs on each amorous couple and thus the text seems disorganized and choppy. If Herman had selected 12 royal mistresses and then followed the themes she identifies within each of these stories, the text would have been more easily understood and the narrative flow would improve. That being said, the various adventures in this book were very entertaining. The story of Anthenais de Montespan and Louis XIV was a highlight of the book. Anthenais is obsessed with remaining as the king's favorite, involved in attempts to keep all beauties away from the eyes of the king while giving him secret love potions. Yet she is trumped by her children's old maid governess, Madame de Maintenon, who eventually becomes the king's legal wife after the death of the Queen. This is a fascinating twist of fate, and yet as Louis XIV grew older and more mature, it would only seem natural that he was less interested in exotic young beautiful lovers and became interested in a woman of intelligence, character and good judgement. The mistress that receives the most coverage is, of course, Jeanne-Antoinette Etioles, Marquise de Pompadour. This beautiful, refined, intelligent, and sophisticated woman ruled the court of Louis XV, a man of normal intelligence and instincts but not a great thinker or strategist. Pompadour was probably the most influential and powerful of all royal mistresses in Western Civilization, chosing to make critical decisions of state on behalf of the king rather than to worry about jewels and finery. The most entertaining mistress would have to be Lady Castlemaine, lover of Charles II. Her ability to manipulate Charles II, while gathering untold riches for herself, is almost unbelievable. Charles II actually was unable to pay the sailors in his navy because of the funds he spent on Lady Castlemaine. The life of Marie Jeanne du Barry, the final mistress of Louis XV, is a wild tale of a beautiful prostitute, elevated to the role of the King's mistress due to her exceptional beauty, and yet she remained an innocent soul with little intelligence. Comtesse du Barry went into retirement with her jewel collection upon the death of Louis XV. Her jewels were stolen and later recovered in London. By this time the revolution had begun and Louis XVI and Marie Antionette were imprisoned. Comtesse du Barry was able to get permission to go to England to reclaim her jewels at a time when the revolutionary government was not allowing the ruling class to leave France. The ironic thing is that du Barry returned to France with her jewels and soon died on the guillotine. The book ends with the abdication of Edward VIII to marry Wallis Simpson and the affair between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Edward's low intelligence is explored as well as Prince Charles' lack of judgement around his life with Diana. Camilla actually comes across favorably in the final chapters of the book. The book is full of odd sexy stories that might stimulate folks to actually pick up a history book one day.",

         "Sex with Kings by Eleanor Herman is an eminently readable and enjoyable book detailing the stories and influences of mistresses upon royalty throughout the ages. For all the furor over Bill Clinton's escapades and Charles and Camilla, we find that we are actually more prudish now than they were in the \"good old days\" when royalty openly consorted with mistresses, while queens often were relegated to a lonely existence sequestered with their attendants and delivering the obligatory baby every year or so. Seems that being the King's mistress wasn't all about sex; that in a few cases there was no sexual relationship at all. It was more about friendship and companionship-- whomever said \"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown\" certainly knew what s/he was talking about. With arranged marriages to women often from distant countries who barely spoke the same language as the king, much less shared the same customs and interests, kings sought out mistresses with whom they could converse and who understood their needs and wants. Mistresses were also often privy to court gossip that was very valuable to the kings and mistresses often took part in political machinations-- sometimes for good, sometimes not. The mistress, herself, was often in a shaky position-- she had to continuously maintain her position of favor with the king or otherwise she, and any of the children the king might have fathered, could be summarily cast aside for someone else. It was much easier to get rid of a pesky mistress than to get rid of a pesky wife, as Henry the VIII can attest. This book could so easily have been a dull recitation of the affairs of court, but Herman brings out the human side of the mistresses, their constant struggle to maintain their position, the wiles they used to maintain their positions, and the love they often felt for the kings they served. Humorous in parts, the book is a quick, fun read. My only complaint about it is that it could have been better organized; Herman jumps back and forth from mistress to mistress so that it is hard to keep them straight. Other than that, however, this is an enjoyable book.",

         "There are just some days when you don't want to do anything but read and escape into another world. This book fits that day perfectly. When you're tired and not feeling 100% ~~ this is the best book to escape into. If you like stories about women and friendship, this one is for you. If you like stories about women struggling to find their place in their little corners of the world, this one is for you. It has it all. Romance, friendship, strong women and a nice cozy tale as the yarn spins. I have not read \"The Shop on Blossom Street\" ~~ in fact, I don't think I have read any of Debbie Macomber's books. I do have some on my bookshelf, but I've never picked it up. I will now especially when I am fighting a bad cold and the back to school blahs. This one is a continuation of \"The Shop on Blossom Street\" with Lydia and her sister, Margaret running the yarn shop. This time Lydia decided to have another knitting class, making socks. Elise, Courtney and Bethanne signed up, each with their own stories. Lydia is in love with the most wonderful man, only to have his ex-wife back on the scene. Elise is a divorcee, living with her daughter due to a failed investment. To make things even more interesting, her ex is back on the scene. Bethanne is struggling with a cheating husband who left her for another woman and raising two teenagers. Strapped for cash, she needed to find something to do and fast. Her daughter, Annie, is heading for trouble and she doesn't know how to stop her. Then there's Courtney, an overweight teenager who lost her mother several years prior and moved from Chicago to Seattle to live with her grandmother while her father's in Brazil. Depressed, Courtney joins the knitting class only because her grandma signed her up. This novel covers a span of a year and is very sweet and predictable ~~ but just warm and fuzzy as can be. Like another reviewer said, having a fairy godfather near the end helps make this book an even more cozy read. I don't know anything about Macomber's books to know if this is typical of her books, but after reading this one, I plan to read her others as well. 8-31-06",

There was the angry, the broken, and the discouraged women all over again and I found it difficult to fall into the story and get involved with the characters.  Also, these characters were less 3-dimensional than the Blossom Street book; their individual stories a bit more contrived.  Still, Macomber is an excellent writer and it is a well-written story.

         "Lydia Hoffman is a cancer survivor, and owner of a Seattle knitting shop called A Good Yarn. She delights in her knitting classes and has just started a new one. The first class, consisting of three women, is a disaster. One is irritable, another lacks basic confidence, and the third is a miserably unhappy teen. It's evident that they do not enjoy each other's company. Lydia dates her gorgeous UPS deliveryman, Brad. Both are concerned about Lydia's sister Margaret, who works in the shop. Margaret definitely is not herself. Lydia has other family concerns, namely her mother, who is badly diminished by her husband's death. Elise Beaumont is retired and, thanks to a crooked real estate developer, broke and homeless. All she can do is live with her daughter, wait for the pending lawsuit, and hope she eventually will get some money back. Intrigued at the thought of knitting lessons, she heads down to Blossom Street to check out A Good Yarn. On her way, for some reason, her thoughts turn to her ex-husband, Maverick. Later she discovers that Maverick also will be staying with their daughter, and the thought is intolerable. What will she do? Bethanne Hamlin is devastated by her divorce. Her sixteen-year-old daughter Annie, damaged by her father's leave-taking, is headed for certain trouble. Yet Annie insists her mother take knitting lessons and signs her up at A Good Yarn. Meanwhile, Bethanne must find a job --- and soon. But she has no marketable skills. Or does she? Courtney Pulanski is spending her senior year of high school with her grandmother in Seattle. She's bored, lonely and overweight. When her grandmother treats her to a sock knitting class at A Good Yarn, she goes along with the idea. Cutting back and forth to each woman's story, A GOOD YARN takes the disparate threads and (okay, I can't resist) knits them together into one warm and snuggly shawl of a tale as the knitters form a supportive community. Readers' interest never lags as they root for each character's triumph over her struggle. The identity of a generous fairy godperson is a delightful addition to the plot. I personally found the ending to be wrapped up just a bit too tidily; however, others will no doubt find it to be a satisfying conclusion. A truly enjoyable read.   --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (...)",

         "There's something so soothing about knitting - the sweet clicking of needles weaving yarn into items made with love. It's a very calming hobby and it's no wonder that the beloved craft has made a resurgence in popularity. So it makes perfect sense for best selling author Debbie Macomber to combine her love of knitting and writing as she takes her readers on a trip back to revisit the lovely little yarn shop on Blossom Street in her latest novel, \"A Good Yarn.\" Lydia Hoffman opened her shop, A Good Yarn, a year ago as a celebration in her life of overcoming cancer twice in her young life. The shop was met with great success, and Lydia had found contentment in her life as she taught her beloved knitting classes and renewed her friendship with her sister Margaret who came to work with her. She also found love with deliveryman Brad Goetz and they planned to be married one day soon. But life has a way of throwing monkey-wrenches into the best lives, and Lydia soon finds herself dealing with heartache as Brad announces that he is back on speaking terms with his ex-wife. As Lydia reels from this crisis-of-the-heart, her sister Margaret is also dealing with problems in her own homelife, and their mother is beginning to experience declining health problems that keep both sisters busy dealing with her care. But as always, her optimism for life, her love for and of family and friends, and her knitting carry Lydia through this rough bump in her life. Customers of Lydia's shop flock to her store to find the best yarns and advice on knitting, but they also find warmth and friendship among the threads.  In interweaving stories, three new ladies join Lydia's sock knitting class, and although they are all from diverse backgrounds and ages, they soon find a connection to each other as they click their needles away. Elise Beaumont has recently retired as a school librarian, but finds her dreams of owning her own home dashed as a con-artist makes off with her investment money. Forced to move in with her daughter, Elise is dismayed when it is announced that her ex-husband, a gambler who had been out of her life for many years, would be paying the family an extended visit. Would their former affection for each other resurface, or would old wounds still be tender? Elise finds an escape in her knitting and joins the sock class as a way of avoiding the tense situations at home. Bethanne Hamlin thought she had a perfect life - a wonderful husband, nice home, and great kids. Then her world was turned upside down when her husband leaves her for a younger woman, and the stay-at-home mom must learn to make ends meet.  As her daughter rebels and the financial situation declines, Bethanne splurges on a knitting class as a way of saving a little of her sanity. As she becomes acquainted with the class, she finds not only friendship but encouragement to pursue her dreams. It seemed unusual for a teenager to be enrolled in knitting classes, but Courtney Pulanski's grandmother thought it would be good for Courtney to try this new activity, in addition to the swimming classes with her senior citizens class. The young girl has come to live with her grandmother while her father is working out of the country, and is somewhat depressed and overweight. Courtney soon finds a sense of accomplishment in her knitting and is surprised to find that the swimming and a new hobby of bike-riding is actually helping her physical appearance as well. When she befriends Bethanne's daughter and son, life takes on a new dynamic that makes it more bearable than the teen could have imagined. The ladies from Macomber's book, \"The Shop on Blossom Street,\" make appearances at the shop, interacting with the new ladies and bringing a sense of continuity to the story that I personally hope will continue in future books. (hint, hint!) \"A Good Yarn\" is a heart-warming book that evokes laughter and tears. Macomber is a wonderful storyteller with legions of fans both in the reading world and now in the knitting world.  This book includes patterns for knitting socks and sage advice from knitting experts sprinkled throughout, tying the story together as neatly as knit one, purl one. Knitters and lovers of women's fiction will find a treasure in among the stitches of this tale. Sharon Galligar Chance Wichita Falls Times Record News",

         "First, I am not a dieter!  I never believed in that, but for a short stature, and midlife, my weight was at a standstill after lots of walking daily.  I needed to lose at least 15 pounds, possibly 20. Hubby, on the other hand, was the first to diet, since he has trouble walking fast or great distance.  I figured this is the most efficient method for him to lose stomach fat!  He effectively needed to lose 20 pounds to be more physically fit for age and health. The South Beach Diet was our choice, and when I saw that he made a change in his life, lost about 20 pounds in few months, I accidently started to lose weight too.  Simply because I was cautious of cooking or buying foods he could not have.  This is about predominatly losing the stomach fat in men.  As for women, you lose it in the hips, butt, and thighs. Make a lifestyle change The book is wonderful in educating you on the safety, health, history of the prescribed changes for dieting.  It is easy without measuring, counting calories, or starving. Lose the Cravings!  Good time to stop bad habits. I sit at a desk and stare into a computer all day, and nibbling always gets into the act, Chinese crackers, that once in a while nutbar, lots of fruit. That was what consisted of most of my nibblings.  So I did have control, but on the diet, you do LOSE the CRAVINGS, just as the book says.  My goal is to eat effectively without gaining the cravings.  And, if you are on the diet for weeks at a time, on or off, it may be a good time to stop any bad eating habits. Recipes, lists, and more There are plenty of recipes for that lifestyle change.  The book also effectively lists the foods to avoid/or lessen in your lifetime, and the Foods to Avoid/Foods to Have in phases 1 and 2. If I hadn't seen this work before my own eyes, I would not have believed it.  But the real trick is to KEEP the Weight OFF  .....Rizzo",

         "\"Sandstorm\" is an entertaining read, a somewhat-lite adventure story that's parts Indiana Jones (there's even a character that is named Omaha Dunn and teasingly nicknamed Indy), parts Dan Brown-wannabe.  Religion, legends, myth and science-fiction elements are all whipped up together to tell the story of a journey in the search of the lost city of Ubar, after a suspicious explosion at a museum that contained Arabian relics.  I say it's somewhat-lite because often the reader will be exposed to convoluted scientific explanations or brief, history lessons.  However, neither the scientific nor the historical explanations seemed realistic to me, always shrouded in mysticism or fantasy.  Simply put, I didn't really buy most of what was written, but it was easy to just casually accept it and continue with the story, after all, the Indiana Jones movies were rife with religious connotations.  What I liked best were the numerous action scenes and usage of advanced technology.  I also liked one of the main characters, Painter Crowe, a Native American top-notch agent, highly capable in both military and scientific operations.  The rest of the cast is just okay, some coming across whiny, or even boring.  Omaha Dunn, the adventurer, never really compares to the other main male lead, Painter.  The main female lead, Safia, is not really that interesting either, seemingly just forced to go through the motions of the story. In conclusion, not a book I'd recommend, but if something about the story catches your eye, then it won't be a wasted experience either, at the very least, it would be entertaining enough to warrant the time spent on it.",

I heard of the SBD many years ago when it was first introduced. Like every other fad diet, I dismissed it without even giving it a second glance. \"They never work,\" I said, and went about my happy carb-filled and FAT life. I have always been heavy, and my famliy is full of big people, so losing weight hasn't ever been encouraged at home. I was raised on lots of bread, pasta, potatoes and fattening carbs. I NEVER drank water. I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted, and it left me feeling depressed and hopeless. I hated how I looked in everything--even though I loved clothes and fashion--because of my weight. I had tried several times to lose weight, to restrict myself, and would average 6-8 lb losses before giving up and reverting back to my old ways. June of '08 I actually found a copy of The South Beach Diet outside in a shopping cart at the grocery store. I picked it up and flipped through it, threw it in the car and thought I might read it. Someday. It sat around the house for a while before I finally picked it up and gave it a go. Immediately I thought, WOW, is this the answer? and then right after that: \"YEAH, RIGHT.\" But, negativity aside, I read the book and decided to give it a try. It made total and perfect sense why I was fat--the book explains the reason behind it and the why and how, and the proof is undeniable. I completely cut out bread, potatoes and pasta, and anything with sugar in it. I followed Phase 1 pretty well for about 4 weeks, and in that time alone, lost about 18 lbs. I would sometimes walk for 10 or 15 minutes here or there, on my lunch at work, or at home around the block, but I wasn't making any real efforts as far as exercise went. However, it was so much more than what I used to do, I started seeing a difference in how I felt and looked almost immediately. As each week passed by and the number on the scale steadily decreased, I found myself feeling more and more energetic, and committed to the new \"lifestyle\". It doesn't feel like you're on a diet, it feels like you're just being HEALTHY. I have never been able to stay on a diet before, but the South Beach Diet is so easy to follow, and the results are so remarkable, I can't even stop myself now! It took me a while to get into the swing of things, but now that I have been doing it, it is natural to me. I was once a skeptic of this and other fad diets, but now I am recommending it to everyone. Even with minimal exercise, to date, I have lost a substantial amount of weight and the best part is--I don't feel hungry or deprived--EVER!!! I really have to give it to Dr. Agatston because even though I have only lost a fraction of the amount of weight I want to lose, I know that it is something I will acheive because of this diet. I stepped on the scale today and had to smile: 224lbs. I haven't weighed that since college (sadly!). I know I still have a long way to go, but I also know that I will make it, and all my thanks goes to Dr. Agatston and his book The South Beach Diet. I urge anyone who is fed up with being overweight, and fed up with diets, to BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It really changed (and IS changing) my life, everyday. I think it can do the same for you too. It works if you work it!!!!",

         5,
         "This is a very important book: it is an important subject tackled by an important author. Guinness, one of our finest Christian commentators and thinkers, argues that the issue of suffering and evil is our most urgent and serious problem. Evil may have been always with us, but Guinness argues that for the first time in human history, many people no longer have a coherent moral and intellectual framework with which to assess it. More disturbing, we no longer have a shared understanding about whether there even is such a thing as evil. Ironically, while the scale and scope of evil has increased in the modern world, our ability to respond to it has weakened. Because of the \"sorry state of moral illiteracy and intellectual cowardice\" that we moderns find ourselves in, we have a hard time even recognizing evil. Or worse still, we simply make excuses for it. Utopian views of human goodness and a refusal to face reality have resulted in a moral myopia that cannot call evil evil. Indeed, postmodernism compounds the problem, by arguing that calling something evil is the real crime. PoMo has \"spawned legions of people who pronounce all judgments of evil to be judgmental and evil themselves\". Guinness spends a lot of time asking questions about evil and suffering, saving tentative answers for the end of his book. The questions themselves reveal a very deep and nuanced struggle with the issue. Guinness has drawn deeply from the wells of human reflection on, and interaction with, the subject of pain and suffering. His many incisive quotes from a range of authors, thinkers, philosophers and religions are alone worth the price of the book. As part of his investigation, he describes in detail three main responses to the problem of evil. The three main families of faith in the modern world are the Eastern, the secular, and the Judeo-Christian. Eastern responses to evil include that of Hinduism, Buddhism, and much of the New Age Movement. A common theme of the Eastern approach is that there is no real solution to evil in this world, only the renunciation of this world. Freedom from evil means freedom from individuality. If the East is world-denying, the next main option is world-affirming. In the secularist family of faith (atheism, naturalism, secular humanism, etc.) evil is something that we alone must confront. There is no God to help us, so we must create our own paradise on earth. And we have certainly seen some robust attempts in the past century to do just that. Great experiments in producing a new man and a new social order have been tried, but only to be found greatly wanting. The grand social utopias, be they of Stalin, Hitler or Mao have all resulted in the most horrific bloodshed known to man. Secularist regimes with secularist visions of heaven on earth have only led to hell on earth. Indeed, more people were killed by the secularists in the twentieth century than all other ideologies combined before then. The last family, the great monotheistic faiths, has quite a different spin on things. The Judeo-Christian tradition sees evil as an intrusion into this world. Things are not the way they are supposed to be. Evil is unnatural and an intruder. The doctrine of creation tells us about how the world was meant to be, while the doctrine of the fall tells us what has gone wrong. But it does not end there. In the Christian version of things, the doctrine of redemption tells us how evil has been faced head on, and how it has been, and ultimately will be, overcome. Thus we can join in fighting against evil without seen to be fighting against God. God does not abandon us in our struggle against evil. Indeed, \"no other god has wounds,\" Guinness reminds us. In the Eastern view, detachment is the solution. In the secular view, denial or utopianism is the proposed course. In the Christian view, God enters into our predicament, suffers for us and with us, and leads us in the way ahead. The three views could not be more different. In the Christian religion, not only is there a plausible explanation for evil, but there is the conviction that something has been done about it. God has entered human history and confronted sheer evil. And the sheer love of God has defeated this evil. Of course the mystery of evil can never be fathomed, at least in this world. In the Hebrew scriptures a whole book was devoted to the subject. Job asked a lot of questions which were never answered. \"In the end, rather than getting an answer from God, Job encounters God himself, which is his answer.\" The timeless truths of the Christian faith will not satisfy everyone. And as Guinness points out, some of the most anguished cries against God concerning the problem of evil have come from believers, not atheists. The Christian solution must be weighed up and compared to its chief rivals. No one system may completely satisfy. But by means of  a careful presentation of the main alternatives, this book helps to lay out the quite different approaches to this vexatious problem, helping all pilgrims along the way to see more clearly and perhaps more hopefully. If this book ultimately sheds little new light on the subject, it is because it does not claim to do so. It can only restate what has gone before. And this restatement is superbly done. And given the age of terrorism and genocide that we find ourselves in, the demand for a careful restatement is more urgent than ever.",

         "I knew coming into American Gods, it was going to be a different type of book than I had read before.  It was not only different, but challenging and weird, though that doesn't mean it wasn't a good read.  The protagonist, Shadow, is released from jail days early to attend his wife's funeral and begins a surreal journey across America physically and metaphysically as a bodyguard to Mr. Wednesday.  Throughout this journey Shadow meets gods both ancient, or at least an American incarnation, and modern as his employer attempts to rally the older gods to rise up and challenge the newcomers.  Given his special relationship to Wednesday, Shadow is targeted by what seem to be forces in the government and thus has to hide away in the small town of Lakeside.  And throughout all of this Shadow must come to terms with his wife's death, though she keeps on visiting in various locations in the flesh. The structure of the book mainly followed Shadow who, like the reader, is learning that the gods of past are real and very much in the now though because of innate privacy the reader doesn't learn much about Shadow as a person throughout the book.  Yes, we learn things about Shadow but after spending almost 600 pages that his character dominates, we really don't know him.  While some could consider this a flaw, personally I thought it was a strength of the novel.  At the end of some chapters Gaiman, through the writing of Mr. Ibis, describes how gods arrived in America through the travels of their believers.  Throughout the book there are several \"interesting\" scenes which might be disturbing for some readers or just frankly too weird for them.  I'll be honest some of them were pretty out there, but knowing what I was getting into I was able to bare them. After finishing the book, I was glad to have spent the time I did reading it and there is no other thing I can say to recommend it.  But I'm going to paraphrase a statement I made earlier: it's different, challenging, and weird but that doesn't mean it isn't good.",

This child has everything going wrong for him, from the time he got up in the morning...gum in hair, tripped on his skateboard, didn't get a toy in his breakfast cereal when his brothers did.  He thinks he'll move to Australia. On the way to school he doesn't get a window seat. At school the teacher liked someone else's picture of a sailboat over Alexander's invisible castle (he didn't draw anything). He left out the number 16 at counting time.  He \"could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.\" And on it goes.  So far, his complaints are fairly innoculous.  This kind of stuff can happen to any kid, but his behavior begins escalating into bad behavior.  \"I hope you sit on a tack, I said to Paul. I hope the next time you get a double-decker strawberry ice-cream cone the ice cream part falls off the cone part and lands in Australia.\" More everyday \"bad\" stuff happens to him--he didn't get dessert in his lunch, a trip to the dentist reveals a cavity.  Then at the car his brother made him fall and his other brother calls him a crybaby--so he punches him. He makes a mess at his father's office. He hates lima beans (served at dinner). He hates kissing (saw it on TV). Bath was too hot. Soap in his eyes.  Hates his pajamas.  Goes to bed thinking of his terrible day, and his mom assures him some days are like that, even in Australia.

         5,
         "The South Beach diet is nothing at all like Atkins - I don't know why other reviewers compare them at all.  I have tried both.  On the Atkins diet I lost about 10 pounds in one month, but I had headaches, no energy and felt sick from the zero-carb diet (my body went into ketosis). I had to quit after one month and gained all that weight right back. I've been on South Beach for 3 months now and have suffered no ill effects - in fact this is the healthiest I have felt in years!  Not only am I losing weight like never before (about two pounds per week on average) but my complexion has cleared up, I don't catch every cold that comes along, and I feel great! Unlike Atkins, you do NOT cut out all the carbs - you just cut out the BAD carbs, like sugar and starch.  You give up all the sweets, potato chips and fried foods.  And unlike Atkins, you don't fill yourself with heavy, fatty foods like bacon - you cut out the bad, saturated fats and only eat \"good\" fats. For the first two weeks you have to live without alcohol, fruit and bread - but it isn't really that rough.  It's only two weeks.  During that time, which is called Phase One, your metabalism and body chemistry changes.  After Phase One you don't even crave these foods like you did before. On Phase Two you hardly even feel like you are dieting.  Typical meal for me:  Salmon fillet with asparagus and hollandais sauce, whole-wheat bread roll, green salad with balsamic dressing, red wine and for dessert:  strawberries dipped in dark chocolate!  I don't feel deprived, I eat my fill and I enjoy my meals.  I don't spend a lot of time counting calories, I just weigh in once a day and watch the pounds come off. I never thought I would be able to lose weight like this.  I was a stick figure most of my life, running around in size 5 mini-skirts, eating whatever I wanted without a care in the world - then when I hit my 30's my metabolism finally caved in to bad eating habits and I ballooned up to a size 14 almost overnight. I tried Atkins, I tried Scarsdale, I tried juicing and colon cleanses, I hired a personal trainer and worked my butt off at the gym - and I couldn't put a dent in my weight!  In fact, I gained weight because of all the muscle I put un undernieth the fat! An aquaintence had recommended South Beach to me over a year ago, but I was so gun-shy from all the failed diets that I ignored what she said - until I saw her months later and she had lost 35 pounds!  I realized something must have worked, so I decided to try it - and low and behold it did work and it was FAST!  20 pounds gone in the first two months and I am down to size 8.  People comment to me on how much younger I look.  My double chin is gone, I have cheek-bones again - and all that muscle I got at the gym actually SHOWS!  I can see my knee-caps again, the cellulose is melting away and I really do feel 10 years younger. I still have a long way to go to get back to size 5, but I can actually see light at the end of the tunnel.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a healthy life-style change.  It is well written, easy to follow and very simple.  There are a lot more foods that you CAN eat than what's on the no-no list, and all you really give up is the stuff that's bad for you anyway. Go for it - you have nothing to lose except FAT.",

Rina Lazarus makes a sympathetic character, one that draws the reader into the story, even if they've never personally known any Orthodox Jews.  As a woman, it's easy to identify with this character.  A widowed mother of two little boys, she supports her family by teaching school and working as the mikveh lady at the ritual bath. Author Faye Kellerman also deftly handles some cultural issues that exist within the Jewish community: Rina's less religious parents aren't happy with her choice to live as an Orthodox Jew.  Even in later books in the series, her parents remain distant, bit players in the lives of their daughter and her two sons. Without spoiling the heart of the story, LAPD cop Peter Decker comes into her life after investigating a crime that happens outside the mikveh, the ritual bath house.  The story between them unfolds in a reasonable and believable way, and sets the pace for the entire series of books, which have stretched over twenty-two years.  None of them are as much fun to read as 'The Ritual Bath.'",

         "In this novel, the first in a series of stories featuring LA detective Peter Decker and Jewish teacher Rina Lazarus, Kellerman weaves many elements together successfully: there's a crime, a hero (and heroine), the promise of romance, a social message, and enough action to keep the reader interested in both the resolution and the characters.  The story begins with a rape; as heinous as the crime is, the fact that it has occurred in a yeshiva in the Southern California foothills adds even more complications that usual for Pete Decker.  The community of the yeshiva is closed, literally and symbolically, to outsiders.  The only person who seems willing to help Decker is Rina, a young widow who is devoted to `Torah' Judaism, and her sense of duty includes running the mikvah, or ritual bath, for women in their purification after monthly menses.  Rina found the victim, a woman who left the mikvah only to be attacked on her way home.  As the plot unfolds, Kellerman reminds us of the fact that Anti-Semitism is unfortunately alive and well in our own time, even if not intended: the cops, including Decker, refer to the yeshiva as `Jewtown' at the beginning of the novel; later, Rina is accosted by punks in a parking lot, simply because she is Jewish.  Decker balances his pursuit of the yeshiva rapist with another rapist with a similar mode of operation, and the two plotlines intertwine well.  Although I pretty much knew who did the yeshiva rape and why fairly quickly into the novel, the characters kept me interested in following their story: it was obvious that Rina and Decker would have some kind of relationship by the end of the book, despite Rina's devotion to her religion and only dating within it.  Kellerman does add a little bit of `deus ex machina' at the end to smooth the way for future books with these two characters, but that is forgiven, since we do end up caring about them and their relationship.  Definitely a good beginning to a (hopefully) good series.",

         "Police detective Peter Decker is called to an orthodox Jewish community to investigate the rape of one of the women who lives there.  The call is made by the victim's friend, Rina Lazarus, whom Peter is attracted to immediately.  Thus begins a wonderful mystery series which features a strictly religious orthodox Jewish woman, and a man who is indifferent to religion, but not to Rina.  The tension between the two creates a wonderful dance of approach/avoidance and a question as to whether their beliefs or their feelings will reign supreme in their relationship.  Decker becomes acquainted with Rina's two sons and does his best to protect her from any future sexual attacks by the predator who roams the yeshiva community.  The rape occurred near the mikvah where the women go for spiritual purification.  Throughout the book the reader is treated to a background of orthodox Jewish practices and receives a real education in this fascinating religion.  The difficulties in the relationship between Rina and Peter are clearly defined, but the ending leaves room for further development in the other books of the series.",

         "Faye Kellerman is well known for her thrillers, and \"The Ritual Bath\" is the first of the Peter Decker/Nina Lazarus series.  This book is both attractive for readers who appreciate the \"thriller\" as well as for those who are not familiarized with this type of gene.  F.Kellerman elaborates on two parallel plots, the first one being the crime itself (a woman is raped close to the mikvah) and the love relationship between two individuals of different religious background (Rina Lazarus the orthodox Jew and Peter Decker the strong-minded police detective).  The latter plot is more artistically developed and takes precedence over the first one.  The setting is a small Jewish orthodox community on the outskirts of Los Angeles and the meaningful descriptions of orthodox rites are embodied with great moral content.  Well elaborated, main characters with strong structured identities, a most enjoyable reading.",

         "The science behind successful dieting (which is never discussed in this book) is very simple:  You must burn more calories than you eat each day.  If you do so, you will lose weight.  (And that's why you will lose more weight if you exercise more).  The difficulty comes from finding a diet that is feasible for your lifestyle, i.e. one that you can follow without cheating. With that in mind, and after conducting some research, I decided to try South Beach.  I have never gone on a diet before but I felt it was time to shed a few pounds.  If you want to save the cost of the book, the diet can be boiled down succinctly as follows:  For 1 month, don't eat bread, rice, pasta, desserts, most fruits and juices, ice cream or anything with a lot of sugar (including most desserts).  That's really it.  After the 1st month you can gradually add back fruits and a limited amount of fiber-rich products like wild rice and 9-grain bread. The good news:  if you follow this diet you will lose weight!  I lost 7 lbs in 3 weeks even with an occasional deviation.  The bad news:  sticking to the diet will not be easy. The South Beach diet is not rocket science.  Almost every diet encourages people to eat lots of low-calorie rabbit food, i.e. salads, vegetables and fruit, and to avoid high-calorie sugary products like candy, desserts, etc.  The difference with South Beach is that it also encourages people to eat chicken, fish and even beef and pork with the hope that you will feel sufficiently full that you won't be tempted to cheat by eating high calorie low nutrition carbs like bread, rice and potatoes.  And it works if you stick with the plan. However, this diet- like all I've seen - is going to be tough for those who don't have access to these foods during the day.  For example - how is a construction worker supposed to do a salad for lunch?  Cottage cheese?  etc.  And this diet- like all others - fails to provide a good variety of snack options for those of us who don't eat nuts or again have access to refrigeration.  In addition the emphasis on avoiding carbs rather than on counting calories could lead you to some bad decisions.  For example, you will not lose weight by buying a 400 calorie \"low carb\" protein bar rather than a 160 calorie jamba juice drink (both of which are equally filling in my opinion).  Similarly, a 40 calorie popsicle is a lot better for you than some fatty creme dessert (and more tasty too IMO). As for the book itself, it is mostly fluff and could be condensed into about two dozen pages if you eliminate the recipes and daily diets (most of which aren't followed).  However, I still give it 3 stars because I know it has worked for myself and many friends and relatives.  Just remember that most diets fail after about 3 months because people get tired of depriving themselves of prohibited items.  Dr. Agatson believes that you will have less desire for sweets and carbs if you give them up for a month or two, but that remains to be seen as evidenced by the number of people who regain their weight within a year.  However, if you permanently alter your habits by giving up those 500 calorie Starbucks scones and eating more salads, you will be successful.",

         "I want to start off by saying that I loved this book. It captured my interest right away and kept it all the way through. I've been telling everyone about it and can't wait to get my hands on another book by Gaiman. The storyline is unique and off the wall and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Then there is the writing. Gaiman is a master of language. There are even passages I marked because I loved them so much and want to reread them again later. All that being said, I did not race through this book, but savored it. It took me a while to read because I didn't want to rush it.. It is not only the writing that's intriguing, but the subject matter.  Gaiman explores interesting issues and philosophies, the way our culture has changed since people started coming to North America, and even what has happened since. This all revolves around the gods - the ancient ones from the old country and the new one's of technology and money. Shadow is in jail for a bank robbery and, after three years, is going to be released. He has everything to live for, until he finds out that his wife and best friend (also his future employer) have been killed in a car accident. Shadow leaves jail and goes home, unsure of what he will do. Along the way he meets Mr. Wednesday, who offers him a job. It turns out that Wednesday is an old world god, trying to rally up other gods to fight the new world gods for survival. I don't want to say too much about this book because I don't want to give it away. There are so many twists and turns, rich explorations of ideas, and stunning writing, that it will keep you turning the pages. One of my favorite quotes (because I love books so much):   \"What I say is, a town isn't a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless it's got a bookstore it knows it's not fooling a soul.\"",

         "Listening for Lions, by Gloria Whelan was a great book! I only finished reading it. It held me for hours. This book is about Rachel Sheridan, whose parents work in Africa as missionary doctor and teacher. Rachel has grown up in Africa, and loves every bit of it. The people, the animals, the land, the sky, the weather. After her parents die from the sudden influenza that strikes Tumaini, where she lives, she has to stay with the Pritchards, her English neighbors who also lost their daughter. Soon, Rachel is caught up in their deceitful, greedy scheme and is being shipped to England to possibly save an old man...by lying and posing as someone she isn't. Though she's in England, trying to tell the truth and yet not succeeding, her heart is still back in Africa with the people of Tumaini. From the maybe third chapter to the end of part two, this book was absolutely fabulous and gripping. Although I thought the ending wasn't as strong as it might've been, I think it was satisfying enough. Told from first person in a most curiously simple and powerful voice, this is a great book! :D I love the figurative language she uses, and how she uses them to show her feelings. Yes, you should get this book. :) I love the cover art, too.",

         "Maybe it's me, but I seem to be less enamored of this book than other reviewers. It's not a dud by any means, but there are problems with this book that makes me reconsider whether I should have my students read it or not. I hate to start with constructive criticisms (or negative aspects, if you prefer), but I think the positives have been clearly identified by the other reviews posted here. Nevertheless, my three biggest problems with this YA novel [notice that I pointed out that this is a Young Adult book -- I feel this is very important in reviewing this novel]  are that it is overwritten, filled with melodramatic characters, and the denouement is incredibly long. In claiming LISTENING FOR LIONS to be overwritten, I mean that I found the inexhaustible number of similes, as well as the enormous number of animals and plants mentioned throughout the book seemed so inorganic that I felt like I should have been writing down each one as it is mentioned so that I could be impressed in the end that I had read about so many different examples of the natural world. Enough already! They are distracting from the flow of the writing, and that takes focus from the characters. If writing seems to force in facts or lists or bits of \"clever creative writing\" here or there, it destroys the beauty, the flow, the ease of the story. Next, not all, but many of the characters are just too melodramatic. By this, I do not mean that they seem to over-react and seem to be right out of a soap opera. Instead, I mean that they are characterized by the definition of a \"melodramatic\" character; in other words, they don't change at all from beginning to end. Anyone who has read this book can easily see that Valerie's parents fit this description quite accurately. Their actions (as well as others) are highly predictable, and don't give the reader a sense that we are going to be surprised by anything...and, unsurprisingly, we aren't. It all seems to play out like a typical melodrama. As for the denouement (or falling action), once we see or anticipate what the ending is going to be, the reader's patience begins to ebb when made to wait excessively. In this case, the final third of the book seems to go on forever. We know where Rachel is going to end up and now we have to wait for it, and wait for it, and wait for it... I truly appreciate the clash of cultures set up in this book, but the basic difficulty I find with LISTENING FOR LIONS is that my students (well-read eighth-graders) will find this to be predictable, uninspiring or not effectively engaging -- particularly in comparison to the dozens of other books that they will be reading this year. Sadly, this book has disappointed me because I don't see it as anything but a Young Adult novel. The best YA books I eagerly endorse and urge adults without kids to read (for example: AL CAPONE DOES MY SHIRTS, SPEAK, CRISS CROSS, PETER AND THE STARCATCHERS, THE GOLDEN COMPASS, ONCE UPON A MARIGOLD, the original THE SECRET GARDEN). This, I'm sorry to write, is not a YA book that is meant for anyone but kids.",

         "This book shows you how to eat like a normal person and lose weight -- without dieting! The basic idea is that refined, high-carb foods cause weight gain, especially in the stomach. Even though nutrition experts insist you can't lose more weight in your stomach than elsewhere, I tried it and it works. Two years ago, I did Phase 2. I dropped a dress size and my stomach -- which always stuck out no matter how much weight I lost elsewhere -- is now flat. I've had no trouble continuing to eat this way and to maintain the weight loss. After all, it's super easy, since all you're doing is eating in a traditional manner. I eat a small amount of sugar every day -- and still no weight gain. The book is not without flaws. Phase 1 is an unnecessary and unhealthy crash diet, but it can be skipped. Also, you can probably safely eat any vegetable or fruit, except for potatoes, which raise blood sugar more than sugar does. (The author has since revised his stance against such vegetables as carrots, which have a low gylcemic load.) A really excellent aspect of this book is its emphasis on health, not just losing weight. The author stresses the importance of eating \"good\" fats, such as nuts, oils, avocados, fish, eggs, and mayonnaise, which are good for the heart and actually help counteract the effects of dangerous fats, such as partially hydrogenated oil. So many people have the misconception that all fats are bad, and they torture themselves with low-fat diets that are unhealthy -- and probably cause weight gain. The author also points out that partially hydrogenated oil is actually worse than lard, since it contains only bad fats and no good fats, and should not be eaten at all. He also recommends a moderate intake of saturated animal fats. He also recommends staying active -- just 20 or 30 minutes a day of walking is all you need. All in all, very reasonable advice and highly recommended. I look forward to the day when The South Beach Diet becomes orthodoxy and restaurants start serving whole grains and green leafy vegetables.",

         "When she opens a yarn and knitting shop on Blossom Street, cancer survivor Lydia Hoffman doesn't know what to expect. She has enough money to run the shop for a while, but will she bring in customers? Or is she simply wasting her time and creating a burden on her mother, as her sister hints? It doesn't take too long before Lydia's beginning knitting class starts up with three very different women. Jacqueline Donovan is a wealthy snob, contemptuous of her daughter-in-law and angry with her husband for having an affair. Alix Townsend is planning on working off the community service time she earned for having drugs in her purse (they belonged to her roommate). Carol Girard is obsessed with having a baby--no matter what the financial, emotional, or ethical costs. Despite their differences and initial conflict, the four women forge a bond, gradually growing together. At first, the women seem to share only two things--their knitting and an unhealthy self-obsession. By working together, each becomes free to break out from their self-imposed boundaries and to see how their self-destructive behavior was a choice rather than something imposed on them from the outside. Author Debbie Macomber specializes in strongly written stories of women coming together for support and growth. THE SHOP ON BLOSSOM STREET is a strong entry into this category. Although all four women may initially put readers off, their growing strength as they finally face their problems and seize their power makes them sympathetic and even heroic. The love interests are possibly a bit too perfect, but this is a romance after all and who needs a romantic fantasy about a realistic male.",

This diet is so unique because its not just about losing weight but changing your lifestyle and focusing on a healthier you. I love this diet because it stresses not having to feel hungry and isn't complicated! This is the perfect diet for everyone, mainly because you do not have to deprive yourself! You'll enjoy normal size helpings of meat, poultry, and fish. You'll also eat eggs, cheese, nuts, and vegetables AND (my favorite part) - snacks are required! You'll learn to avoid the bad carbs, like white flour, white sugar, and baked potatoes. Best of all, as you loose weight, you'll loose that stubborn belly fat first! The intial two week period is the most restrictive part of the diet. This phase was hard for me because I am always craving bread, pasta and fruit but there are still choices and snacks. The second phase offers somewhat more choices, including whole wheat bread and other selected carbohydrates. Also, roughly half the book is comprised of complete meal plans along with simple recipes! I also love how the book is written - in a conversational tone and inviting manner that makes the book more appealing than many other diet tomes.

The South Beach Diet Quick and Easy cookbook provides simple, quick recipes with ingredients that are easy to find in a typical grocery store.  In the beginning of the book, Dr. Agatston provides the reader with a complete glossary of ingredients, a list of quick meal ideas, food safety tips, and a list of 10 essential kitchen tools.  The recipes are categorized into breakfast, soups, snacks, salads, seafood, poultry, meat, vegetarian, side dishes, and desserts.  Recipes are color-coded for Phases 1, 2, and 3 of the South Beach Diet. I wasn't sure what to expect, since I had heard the stereotypical complaints of health food being dry, boring, and tasteless.

         "i never realized how addicted to sugar and bread i was until i tried this diet. the first three to four days of phase 1, the most strict, i was miserable. i had HORRIBLE headached from the lack of sugar. i used to drink about 10 diet sodas a day....maybe have water once a month. after those first few days, i COULD NOT drink diet sodas anymore. they tasted like nasty syrup medicine....and they STILL do. so now, i drink nothing but water and sometimes some sugar free crystal light. bread is still my downfall so i just don't buy it anymore. i buy wheat bread because i hate it and the rest of my family is okay with it. i stayed on phase 1 for 2 weeks and lost ten pounds. on phase 2 i have maintained my weight even through my \"snack days\". this is by far, the easiest way that i have ever lost weight. i can actually see my toes because my belly fat really disappearred. i have gone down two dress sizes in two weeks. i have never tried atkins but my sister is on that diet currently and is having trouble losing weight on it. once you get used to the format of the book, it's not hard to follow at all although, it could have been put together a little better. i will follow the SBD for my entire lifetime as i have never felt lighter or healthier or HAPPIER. say HELLO to the new me!",

         "\"The South Beach Diet\" is just a healthy way of eating.  It's not a miracle or anything new for that matter.  Other than it being an obvious take on \"Atkins\", it is what experts have been telling us for year.  Cut out the bread, cookies, candy, and eat more lean protein and lots of vegetables.  So what is so new and innovated about this?  Nothing worth spending your hard earned money on.  The recipes are \"involved\" not easy throw togethers.  It's hard to imagine incorporating them into a daily lifestyle.  Who has the time? One recipe I did try was nothing short of awful.  Trying to flavor ricotta cheese with Splenda and cocoa powder and pretending it's cheesecake is pretty insulting.  You would do much better use age old wisdom and cutting out the crap in your diet.  We all know the rules and this book is not a magic device to help you follow them. You have to remember calories count, you can't eat a ton of them and lose weight, no matter what their make-up. Keep your protein lean, eat lots of vegetables, cut out the sweets and starches.  When you do eat bread, go whole wheat and you'll lose weight and be a lot healthier.  You'll be  richer too because you would still have the $17.00 you didn't spend on the book.",

This fourth time through, after having read more of his other works and more of the afterwords he's put them, I realized that it really does read like him:  his milieu is \"fairy tales\" AND myth.  This book falls smack in the middle of myth.  Also, a lot of his work is dark, and this book is dark.  There does seem to be a slight difference in tone, though.  \"American Gods\" lacks almost all of the witticisms present in his other works and, somehow, it feels more \"real\" (probably because he invented only the characters and seems to have tried to keep the settings true(ish) to life).

         "One knows that there is a problem with this book by page 3, where the Phase One stage of The South Beach Diet - extremely low-carb - is said to produce a weight loss of 8-13 pounds in 2 weeks, but then there is never any estimate given of how fast or how much weight loss is possible after the first two weeks. Atkins followers know that the early weight loss on an extremely low-carb diet is mostly water loss. \"You'll eat three balanced meals a day...\" is a complete misrepresentation of the ultra low-carb Phase-One. Not that \"balanced meals\" - roughly equal calorie amounts of carb, fat and protein - were a good idea for many people anyway.  The strengths of this book are the admission that the low-fat diet of the American Heart Association and many other NGOs does not work (p8); that there are good and bad forms of LDL cholesterol (p33); that fruit juice with no fiber is worse for you than whole fruit (p46); that more cooking raises the glycemic index (GI) of many vegetables (p53); that fiber consumption will slow digestion of carbs, which is good (p64); and that the bread basket served in restaurants is a diet disaster because of the high GI carb content of the breads (p86). While he understands the value of low GI foods, he is blank on glycemic load, the amount of high GI carbs in a food.  The weaknesses are: Dr. Agatston claims not to have found literature support for a medium carb diet in the literature in the mid-1990s, showing an appalling inability to read the literature, including books by Richard K. Bernstein, MD, Barry Sears, PhD, John Yudkin, MD, and many others. He parrots the nonsense that high cholesterol is a major factor in heart disease (p7, p96) despite evidence from 1937 that it is not, nor is high LDL. See Uffe Ravnskov, MD, PhD, \"The Cholesterol Myths\", 2000. He misrepresents the Atkins Diet as low-fat (p10), and misrepresents most fruits, vegetables and whole grains as containing \"good carbs\" (p10 and many others places) despite the long-known fact that starches that turn to glucose and the fructose from fruits are not beneficial in large amounts. He claims that low-fat dairy products are not fattening (p11) despite their content of high-GI lactose without enough fat to slow its absorption. See Mary G. Enig, \"Know Your Fats\", 1999. He recommends polyunsaturated oils, especially the omega-6 ones (p22), which are definitely not healthful, and worsen heart disease. He slams saturated fats with no evidence whatever on their safety. In fact, a recent study showed that high saturated fat consumption reversed coronary artery blockage, while monounsaturated fat (olive oil) narrowed arteries slightly, and polyunsaturated fats (soybean oil) narrowed arteries seriously (Mozaffarian D et al., Am J Clin Nutr 2004;80:1175-84). He recommends balsamic vinegar (p29) despite its high sugar content. He claims that \"carbs are good for you\" despite evidence that there is no nutritional requirement for them at all in humans (Fred & Alice Ottoboni, PhDs, The Modern Nutritional Diseases, 2002). In dumping on beer (p50, p88), he is unaware of low-carb versions. He thinks apple skin has special benefits; there is no evidence given for this, and not eating it spares you all the pesticide content (p55). In pushing red wines (p56), he ignores the high sugar content of most of them, and is unaware that wine does little to reduce all-cause mortality. He does not emphasize that eating fat will slow digestion of carb much better than fiber (p64). His GI table (pp70-74) leaves out all the foods with low GI, such as meat, fish, fat, oil and nuts. He confuses the sugar content in beets with the lack of it in MSG made from beets (p88). He failed to warn of the dangers of extreme exercise (p92); see Henry Solomon, \"The Exercise Myth\", 1984. He fails to warn of dairy, grain and wheat allergies, and the relationship of these foods to arthritis and cancer (p92). He recommends a form of carb-loading before exercise (p93), contrary to the findings of Barry Sears, PhD (Enter the Zone, by Barry Sears, PhD, and Bill Lawren.  New York, NY:Regan/HarperCollins1995).  He lauds both statin drugs and aspirin despite their bad effect on women of higher mortality and their lack of benefit in men (Duane Graveline, MD, MPH, \"Lipitor Thief of Memory\", 2004). He neglects beneficial effects of vitamin C other than on heart attacks (p94). He mistakes the d-alpha-tocopherol as \"the natural form of  vitamin E\" despite clear research findings that vitamin E is a mixture of 8 compounds (p95). Despite his specialty of medical imaging, he fails to comprehend the findings that the extent of calcified plaque deposits in coronary arteries as found by electron beam tomography has no correlation whatever to serum cholesterol levels (Hecht HS et al., Am J Cardiol 2004;93:101-3).  Most evidence was testimonials, not controlled trials. There were no citations to peer-reviwed journals.  The South Beach Diet is not so great - Bill Clinton used it for years. Some of the most healthful fats are disparaged, and carbs of no value are touted. Grain and dairy allergies are almost ignored. The many recipes given in the book  are flawed for this reason. See Joel M. Kauffman, Low-Carbohydrate Diets, J. Scientific Exploration , 18(1), 83-134 (2004).",

         "I read a few dozen reader reviews with interest--in some cases, more interest than the book itself sustained. Yes, Mr Gaiman has a vivid imagination, and one of his main premises--that the old world gods wither in America, as succeeding generations cease to worship them--is a brilliant concept. But in the course of writing a long book over several years, a lot of other thoughts and influences muddied the literary waters in which he was 'swimming.' It is indeed quite odd that the war between old and new gods is dismissed in a page or two, after much warning and foreboding; it is even stranger that the book concludes with solving a mystery that wasn't an especially prominent plot point. On the plus side, there is a vivid imagination at play here. I suppose the contract a reader makes with a writer is to go where he is taken, and it's a tad unfair to complain that you \"don't like the tangential stories\" (I, for one, did) or \"don't believe the protagonist's character\" -- I tend to agree, and yet, the characterization IS the writer's prerogative... All in all, there are passages of dizzying, phantasmagorical imagery contrasted by plodding, dull stretches and a few too many side roads to travel. So 3 stars seems fair. The call for more clarity and better editing seem warranted, too. Fans of Neil Gaiman are the most likely to be pleased, whereas newcomers to his work, such as myself, might wonder quite what all the fuss is about. Nevertheless, it's good to have a writer of fantasy/supernatural material reach and stretch for meaning and resonance. That he didn't quite there and wasn't too clear about the path is not a disgrace, just a mild disappointment.",

         "It is important to take a moment and look at the books on our shelves and to give them a second read. With so many books and so little time, we can't possibly do this for all of our favorite books, but there are some classics and classics-in-the-making that deserve another reading. One such book is American Gods by Neil Gaiman. Before I start, I should mention that I dedicate this review to Wednesday. If you don't know what I'm taking about, it's time to visit your bookstore. Go now. This year is the tenth anniversary of the publication of American Gods. I can't tell you how many people I know who have been shocked by the fact that ten years have passed since Gaiman's novel first hit the shelves. What surprises me most about this book is that it feels as fresh and relevant today as it felt ten years ago. Likely, I'll be saying these same words ten years from now. I have no doubt that readers and scholars alike will be picking up American Gods in fifty or sixty years and using it as a stick in the sand by which to measure other books that were written in the early twentieth century, but only time will tell. In a nutshell, American Gods is one man's journey to rebuild his life after getting released from prison. Little does Shadow know that the gods have other plans for him, and little do they know that he has his own plans. American Gods is a beautifully told story that is gorgeously written. The characters are all strong, unique individuals. With each turn of the page, you feel like you are getting to know a live person replete with all of the human (and inhuman) flaws that come with wanting to hang onto whatever form of \"life\" they may be experiencing. This novel spreads out, telling a complex tale that spans a huge geographic area, a large number of people, and quite a bit of history and lore. However, as sprawling as American Gods may be, it maintains a cohesiveness that broadens and deepens the reading experience. When I first finished reading American Gods, I remember feeling like I had lost something important (innocence, perhaps), but I gained something of much greater value in return (wisdom, I hope). After rereading American Gods, I was left with the feeling that if there must be gods among us in this \"new\" world of ours, let them be writers who weave tales, tell stories, and keep us bound together in myth and fiction that helps us to better understand ourselves and our world. Neil Gaiman is a phenomenally brilliant writer and storyteller, especially when he turns his hand to these darker adult novels that dare you to think in unconventional ways and inspire you to imagine \"what if\" there were ancient and new gods among us? What would the world be like? Would we even know? Would we want to know? American Gods is one of those books that you will not forget. It is a book that will likely remain on your bookshelf for years to come. If it's on your shelf now, I urge you to open it and to give it another read. If you haven't yet had the opportunity to read American Gods, you are missing out on something special. It also bears mentioning that HBO is planning to produce American Gods as a multi-season series. More information on the development of the series is sure to be coming soon.",

He's tried to keep his head down, learning coin tricks and cell block aphorisms from his low-key cell mate.  And then the world he's been reaching out for shatters.  Summoned to the warden's office, Shadow learns that his wife has been killed in a car wreck and he will be released early to attend her funeral.  He subsequently learns that he has also lost his best friend, his prospects for a job, his illusions about his marriage and any reason to stay in an empty house in his little town. Shadow accepts an offer from Mr. Wednesday, seemingly encountered by chance on an airplane.  He will be Wednesday's chauffer, bodyguard and... something like a straight man.  As they travel through small-town America, Shadow--and the readers--figure out that his employer and those he meets with are more than quirky human beings.  They are gods created and sustained by human belief.  The gods now face a crisis.  As Americans forget about them, they begin to fade away.  Already too many are gone. Wednesday tries to do something about this crisis while Shadow plays a strange and increasingly central role in his plans.  We meet several gods and see signs of their waning influence in an America that has turned its attention to television, technology, and more modern diversions.  Guiman paints the gods large, with expansive personalities, diverse powers, and astonishingly short attention plans. The gods' need for human belief creates a fascinating world where nearly everything important happens behind the scenes.  The slow development of Shadow as a more engaged human being and perhaps something more, is a well-woven plot element.  As we follow him, we ponder mysteries in plain sight that others overlook.  Why are roadside tourist attractions places of mythic power?  What goes unexplained in the small places that draw back from the outside world?  There are answers. Neil Gaiman's story is imaginative, pleasant to read, and captures something of what seems definitively American to a transplanted British author.  It is recommended.

         "\"When the Old Gods died, there Arose the New Gods\" - Jack \"The King\" Kirby Neil Gaiman's novel, \"American Gods,\" plays on an old idea which, as stated in Kirby's classic Comic 'The New Gods,' is about the old vs the new, evil vs good. Only what side is right, and which side is wrong? Gaiman's novel is extremely detailed and establishes powerful characters and powerful relationships. The main character, Shadow gets out of jail due to the sad words \"your wife is dead.\" He wanders out of the jail, after serving time for a botched bank robbery, and gets on a airplane where he meets, by chance, a man named Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday is a strange man, who knows more about Shadow than Shadow is comfortable with. After burying his wife, Shadow encounters Mr. Wednesday and a friend, who turns out to be a leprechaun, and is drafted into a war, called \"the storm.\" The storm is approaching, and it is a fight that is of utmost importance, a fight between the old gods of the old lands, and of the new gods of television, internet and cellular phones. The idea isn't terribly original, but it is told in a refreshingly interesting way, and Gaiman succeeds with flying colors. The characters and story are developed well, slowly becoming solid characters, slowly growing and building muscle atop a rather weak premise. Just about the only complaint I have is not really a complaint at all, but, around the middle things seemed to grind to a halt for a few pages, but it was quite literally the smallest of problems, and is therefore not really a problem. I enjoyed reading the book and truly enjoyed the author's style. I can't wait to read more by Mr. Gaiman. Well played Mr. Gaiman, well played.",

         "I have only ever read two books by Neil Gaiman(please don't lynch me) and they have both been religiously themed, i.e., Good Omens and American Gods.  I can't for the life of me think why it's taken so long to getting around to this one. In my defence, while this 10th Anniversary Edition is a review copy, I do actually own another battered copy of its first iteration, unread, along with its spin-off sibling Anansi Boys- both languish on the TBR shelf. The story, for the uninitiated... ----------------------------------- After three years in prison, Shadow has done his time. But as the time until his release ticks away, he can feel a storm brewing. Two days before he gets out, his wife Laura dies in a mysterious car crash, in adulterous circumstances. Dazed, Shadow travels home, only to encounter the bizarre Mr Wednesday claiming to be a refugee from a distant war, a former god and the king of America. Together they embark on a very strange journey across the States, along the way solving the murders which have occurred every winter in one small American town. But the storm is about to break... Disturbing, gripping and profoundly strange, Gaiman's epic new novel sees him on the road to the heart of America. [Headline Books] So how can one give a review of a book that is beloved of so many, which has been read and reviewed over the last decade and still be fresh. I'll try. Gaiman weaves a number of threads together in this work.  It's a story about gods, travel murder, change,  gah! the more I pick at it the more things it seems to be.  So to begin I'll break it down. Neil Gaiman meets Route 66 -------------------------------- American Gods felt very much like a road trip, despite the fact that a significant portion of the travel in the book was by plane.  Perhaps it's mention of certain American landmarks and iconic places .  Maybe the stereotypes that the gods inhabit, hark back to an older America.  I feel the weight of nostalgia, for things lost in a vast open landscape. That Gaiman can generate this feeling in me I think speaks for the strength of his prose, as in retrospect, there's not actually that much travel. Everyone comes to America, even the gods. -------------------------------------------- Aiding this perception is the fact that it's an immigrant tale as well. A tale of the tired, the poor, the huddled masses and the gods they carried with them. Many of the gods bear the accents and the mannerisms of the culture they spring from and in Shadow traveling to meet them, the reader is given a sense of the cultural diversity that is the melting pot of America, the gods journey there and their slow strung out demise. Yggdrasil versus the Matrix ---------------------------- Entwined with these themes is that of change, old gods versus new - the gods of internet, credit cards and fibre optics. Is this is a comment on what America has become, a land of the almighty dollar, the land of the instant gratification? I am not sure. The Missing God One thing that did strike me as odd was the omission of Jesus.  If any god would be in America you'd think it would be Jesus, but he's conspicuous in his absence, apparently he's in Afghanistan.  Did Gaiman do this deliberately?  He mentions Jesus in the twitter interview printed in the back of this version, but it doesn't answer the question of Jesus' absence or apparent aloofness. Was he playing it safe? Murder Mystery & Confidence Tricks ----------------------------------- There's a murder mystery entwined in the story as well, but the less said about that the better as it's a nice little twist. There's coin tricks and confidence tricks through out the novel, magic and misdirection. Gaiman uses it both as plot device and on a meta level(this should hit you at the end, or before, if you are sharper than me). There's something about old time confidence tricks that harks back to a bygone America, face to face cons that required an understanding of human psychology. Summing up ------------------ This is the authors preferred text, it's a little longer and obviously varies from the first itteration. It includes a twitter interview, as well as a novella featuring Shadow called Monarch of the Glen.  I doubt that I would go back and read the first edition, it's not a tale that I think, given my present reading load, that would be of any benefit and this is after all  Gaiman's preferred story. For Gaiman fans that haven't read this version, it would be worth it if you haven't read the tale in awhile.  American Gods is not one of those pacey pot boilers you read in an afternoon.  It's a book to be savoured and enjoyed, it's a book that requires attention. For some one who is new to Gaiman I'd recommend this version.  It's not as I have said, a pacey read, but an unfolding journey of discovery with a couple of twists that I and perhaps you won't see coming. This was a review copy provided by Headline.",

I have to say, they are right up my chick flick sweet romance hearts and stars alley. Yet I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would.  This was actually more of a 2.5 for me. The funny thing is that I liked the storyline and I liked the characters, which leads me to believe I didn't like the writing. I find that shocking since Macomber is such a well respected/known author. I felt like she had a checklist of things she wanted the reader to learn about each character's past and another checklist of things she wanted to happen to the characters and that's how she wrote this book. Short, choppy sentences that were more like a list than a story. Since I don't know if the writing style had more to do with the story she was telling or if it's her usual style, I will give her books another chance.

The book is filled with \"And then something happened\" \"What was that?\" \"It was the background\" and you have to pick one of the infinite numbers of things that could have happened. What gets me about people who read this guy's books, is that they all think he writes awesome stories, but if you sit them down and say \"Ok, what happened in the scene with the spider?\" you'd probably get a thousand different responses, and none of them would be wrong, because Gaiman didn't actually explain what happened, how they traveled, why, where, what, how they got there. You can draw with crayons and make things up with more detail. Now, aside from that, his grammar, ability to describe random items that mean nothing (Cigarette box, nipple), is actually interesting. Unlike other fiction writers, he only spends a paragraph or 2 doing that, whereas I'm used to having to read 2 pages. I suppose if Mr. Gaiman could describe anything regarding the storyline, he'd probably be one of my favorite authors.

         "There were books written about Japan in 1891 that were better than this book was in 1991. There is no reason to read this book. I'll just give a brief example here. Chapter 9 is supposed to be about homeroom activities, but it opens by confounding the reader with pages of nonsense on the meaning of classrooms in Japan: \"In every school across the country, students are assigned to a homeroom class, or kumi. The word kumi, which is rooted in the Japanese character for thread, was first used several hundred years ago to describe bands of samurai warriors attached to a feudal lord... The importance of the kumi as an educational tool, however, goes beyond this good-natured team spirit. The classroom that the students inhabited had been, in effect, leased to them by the school, in an arrangement not unlike the way a feudal lord lent land to a group of serfs.\" Later, talking about kumi, he writes: \"No one [had warned] me that the country still suffers from the legacy of a four-hundred-year-old feudal class system that was officially outlawed over a century ago.\" This is pure fantasy. The word kumi is the Japanese word for \"form\", as in \"fifth form, third year\". All British schools use this system. Japan adopted it from the British and translated the vocabulary. The second sentence I quoted is not even justifiable by strained etymology but is purely an invention of the author's wild imagination, and the third is his bizarre and wrong conclusion. The entire book smacks of this sort of Orientalism. He even drops the wabi-sabi bomb. Don't read it.",

         "As I made my way through Feiler's account, I was primarily amused by his humorous initial encounters with Japanese culture: the often awkward questions frequently posited him by his friends, coworkers, and students; the stark dissimilarities between the Japanese and the American-style classroom; the extent to which Feiler's foreign appearance and personality caused him to stand out amid an otherwise fairly uniform populace. In nearly every chapter, I found myself laughing out loud. As the book progressed, however, I became disturbed by the author's general exclusion of personal reflections on his experiences. For example, it remains ambiguous whether the author is interested in trying \"nanpa\"--a procedure in which strangers \"pick up\" on women in bars, discos, or similar environments, mostly popular among young Japanese men--out of a genuine desire to procure a Japanese girlfriend, or merely in demonstration of a detached cultural curiosity. He interjects almost no explicit discussions of his feelings or emotional reactions toward the many shocking, challenging, and even tragic events that he encounters throughout the narrative. As someone interested in going to Japan to teach English, and curious about the types of experiences had by Americans who have done so in the past, this particular quality of Feiler's narrative was a bit disappointing. By the end of the book, however, I came to the realization that the very inclusion of certain information in Feiler's memoir speaks volumes on the nature of the clash between Western and Japanese culture. The details that Feiler includes on the overbearingly autocratic leadership style of his school principle, the structure of a seventh-grade fieldtrip to Disneyland Tokyo, and the reaction of Japanese students toward his unorthodoxly American pedagogical style all attest to the impression that Feiler was deeply moved and challenged by his interactions with Eastern culture. And the laughter and tears that several of his anecdotes drew forth compel me to conclude that these passages were not written without emotional affectation. In my preparation to move overseas to teach and live among an unfamiliar society, I found this book deeply enlightening and encouraging. As previous experiences abroad have taught me, being a foreigner in a new country can be a direly lonely and often stressful experience. Feiler has given us an insightful and meaningful account of what Americans moving to Japan ought to expect from the culture clash, as well as detailed many interesting aspects of Japanese society that outsiders interested in the country might not otherwise consider. I highly recommend it.",

         "Wasted a few hours of my life reading this. Things you have to know before buying this book. 1) The main characters name is \"Shadow.\"  Seriously.  He tells people his name is \"Shadow\" and nobody bats an eyelash.  I kept waiting for someone to do a spit-take but it never happens.  His name is Shadow.  Oh, and his wife nicknames him \"Puppy.\"  So if you can stomach your main character being addressed alternatingly as either \"Shadow\" or \"Puppy\" you're in good shape. 2) The \"Gods\" referred to in the book are the lameset bunch of sad-sacks you will ever read about.  They are mortal (in the sense they can be killed with a gun or run over by a car) although they don't age and they look like normal people (some are tall, some are pretty, some are old, some are young).  So what makes them Gods you ask?  Well, they are good at coin-tricks and some of them can hypnotize people.  That's it.  Seriously.  Odin, the father of all Greek Gods has the amazing powers of being able to hypnotize girls into sleeping with him and passing bad checks.  No joke.  That's it.  Why anyone would have ever prayed to these \"Gods\" in the first place God only knows (pun intended).  They are so lame and boring, it's really terrible. 3) You seriously will not care about a sinle character in this book.  I didn't care if the main character lived or died.  I just wanted SOMEONE to do SOMETHING interesting.  Never happens.  Although towards the end things get really retarded and \"Shadow\" gets tied to a tree and dies?  But then starts riding a giant bird around? But it might have been a dream?  Who knows. 4) Ahh who cares.  I've already wasted too much time reading the thing, why waste more writing about it?

         "This is a bad land for Gods...The old gods are ignored. The new gods are as quickly taken up as they are abandoned, cast aside for the next big thing. Either you've been forgotten, or you're scared you're going to be rendered obsolete, or maybe you're just getting tired of existing on the whims of people. Shadow, just out of prison and with nothing to go home to, is hired to be Mr. Wednesday's bodyguard as he travels around America to warn all the other incarnations of gods, legends, and myths, that \"a storm is coming.\" There's going to be a battle between the old gods who were brought to melting pot America by their faithful followers generations ago, and the new gods of technology, convenience, and individuality. That's the premise of Neil Gaiman's American Gods and it's just crackling with promise! But unfortunately, that's not really what this novel is about. It's what the novel keeps telling us it's about (and what many critics told us it was about), but it doesn't deliver. Yes, there are plenty of gods, myths, and legends, and Gaiman does great things with some of them (e.g., Ibis the undertaker and Mr. Nancy) but most are never developed and a reader who has not read an encyclopedia of folklore probably won't catch all the clever allusions. Yes, there's Neil Gaiman's characteristic style, which I always enjoy. His prose is clean, unvarnished, and exquisite. His characters are recognizable; His America is recognizable. In fact, this was the best part of the book (and what Gaiman does so well) -- Shadow's roadtrip across the United States gave Gaiman plenty of opportunities to showcase his humorous insights into the human condition and, in this case, small-town American life. This was lovely, and I enjoyed these parts of the book. The problem with American Gods was that the plot, meandering this way and that across the continent, never solidified. Shadow goes to this American town, meets a few gods and legends, goes to this other place, meets a couple more... There are numerous short stories detailing the lives of these gods and the people who worshipped them, so we expect to see some of these folks again (perhaps at this coming battle), but we don't. A few weird mystical things happen to Shadow and we anticipate an explanation for those occurrences. Then there's a sub-plot involving Shadow's undead wife who asks Shadow to bring her back to life. I don't want to ruin it for anybody, but let me say that the \"storm\" we're promised doesn't materialize. Every time there's a conflict, or a tight spot, someone suddenly shows up and, knowingly or unknowingly, takes care of it. Shadow (and his dead wife) figure out what the bad guys are going to do before they do it. Characters who we hoped might play a bigger role, and events that seemed to be significant, just fade away. The whole thing kind of fizzles. The plot twists at the end aren't clever or inventive -- they just seem to be there to fit the role of \"obligatory plot twist.\" The premise of American Gods has so much promise. I was anticipating some poignant social commentary on America and our habits of worship. After all, American Gods is a best-selling award-winning novel and I expect great things from Neil Gaiman. But it didn't happen this time and I really can't explain the critical acclaim for this novel.",

         "Bruce Feiler spent a year teaching English in a Japanese junior high school in Tochigi prefecture. His book contains both his observations on the Japanese school system and his own experiences as an American living in Japan for the first time. He also takes time to explain unfamiliar aspects of the culture, from Shinto religious practices to the evolution of the Japanese school lunch. This is a very appealing introduction to Japan from a young man who admires many aspects of Japanese culture but does not hesitate to criticize other aspects. There are some wonderful set pieces, such as his introduction to an onsen (hot spring) communal bath, his stay in a hospital, and his climb of Mt. Fuji. Feiler was in Japan in the late 80's, so some of his observations are, of course, dated, but that's hardly a good reason not to read this fine book. How could a memoir not be \"dated\" in the sense that it conveys a particular time and place? Feiler's strength as a writer is the blend of sharp observation and humor (including the self-deprecating kind) that he brings to his book. He depicts very well the sort of \"lost in translation\" moments that any traveler to Japan (or any other unfamiliar place) is bound to have. A further plus is the way he avoids the hushed, reverential tone found in some other accounts by travelers to Japan. This is a particularly useful book if you are planning a trip to Japan yourself.",

         "I started out on the Atkins diet, not South Beach.  I was happy with the results (I lost about 10 pounds in 2 weeks), although I seem to have hit a point where I can't lose anymore.  But this might be because I only had a total of 20 pounds to lose and I'm convinced that those last 10 pounds are only going to come off with frequent trips to the gym.  Anyway, after hearing about the South Beach Diet and its similarities, I decided to read the book and see what I thought compared to Atkins.  I have to say, I think the SBD plan makes more sense than Atkins because of the separation of \"good fat\" from \"bad fat\".  Later in the diet, it also allows you to have complex carbs from whole grain bread, fruit, and fiber-loaded cereal, which Atkins doesn't (and which I've been missing!).  One of the problems I had with Atkins is that his book never really justified why it was ok to eat so much saturated fat and never suggested that mono- or poly-unsaturated fats should be your main fat source, which the SBD does.  Although I like the ideas in the SBD better, the book is lacking in scientific background compared to Atkins New Diet Revolution.  If you REALLY want to know the medical background on lipolysis, ketosis, hyperinsulinism, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, READ THE ATKINS BOOK FIRST (but read \"New Diet Revolution\", not \"Atkins for Life\").  I found it very useful to already know a lot of the medical background on topics that Agatston only briefly goes over.  So, overall I'd say that the SBD is a quicker, easier, but less-informative read (only about 100 pages if you don't include the recipes), and that the diet itself, although based on the same principles as Atkins, is probably safer in the long run than Atkins because of the \"good fat\"/\"bad fat\" separation.  I would suggest that everyone read Atkins first, then read South Beach and DO the South Beach Diet.",

And not all carbs are bad--high fiber wheat breads come back into the picture far sooner than on the Atkins diet. For those bored with no-carb diets, this is a real boon. Relatives of mine report significant weight loss; the jury is out with me. But to be able to eat some carbs in moderation would indeed be nice.

I like to think of my self as an old time Vonnegut fan and I typically understand his satire, wit, negativity about pretty much everything...\"and so on...\" but this book was a real struggle for me.  I actually had to go back and listen to it a second time immediately after finishing it thinking I surely had missed something...some point...anything...and this is what I finally came up with: In my opinion, this book actually starts at the end with Vonnegut himself sitting in a dark corner of a cocktail lounge in a run down, failing little town watching the world go by for many of the resident of the lowly little town on the brink of financial collapse.  As he chases an anti-depressant with a Black and White, his depression and imagination slip somewhere close to madness and the story begins to develop along with some interesting and challenging characters.  As he begins to create the back stories of these characters, I can imagine him pondering what would happen if Kilgore Trout were to come face to face with these folks...what conflict would come of the meeting between Dwayne ( who is slowly going insane) and Trout?  So, he has Trout take a road trip bringing him to a proposed art festival and the final encounter is explosive.  KV inserts himself into the tale at the end, meets KT and tells him he's sorry for all the pain he's created for KT over the years, promises him a more bright future going forward and then \"fade to black\". Now, this may sound like a really good story and I think it could have been but the story is told in so many fragmented bits and pieces of back stories, descriptions of drawings from the paper version, self reflection, personal view points, \"and so on...\" that it is difficult to follow along between about chapter 3 or 4 until the final chapter.  Adding to my struggle, I found the reading of the audio version to be very droll and monotone...which I am almost certain would have made KV very happy.  It is a fitting tone for someone on the edge of madness whose mind would be wandering but, as a listener, I found my own mind wandering to doing laundry, remembering an item I forgot to pick up at the market, planning for next years income taxes. \"ETC.\".

One obvious advantage in Bruce's camp was the fact that he already spoke Japanese and had previously lived in Japan, easing his transition. Although the portrait of Japanese society is somewhat dated (late '80s, much has transpired since then with the Japanese economy), his portrayal of a country at odds with its unique culture versus globalization, of the schools serving as parents and educators combined, and of the group, rather than the individual, as a unit captures the Japanese spirit.

This is one of the few books in the genre which does not make strong distinctions between good and evil. i am reminded of Miyazaki animations where an evil character can do good things and vice versa. Humans are petty, and so are gods. But both exist and are in harmony without any proselyting. Neither group takes the other very seriously. maybe all religion including atheism should be like this. I wish Richard Dawkins would read this book, and then other and earlier science fiction, although the thread is not easily self-evident. Although the style is stiffling and rather inadequate, the story line is strong and carries you through to the end quite quickly and without skipping. The huge amount of physical discomfort due to the weather, the geography, the structures, the vehicles and the lack of sufficient clothing reduces the ease of empathy. I could only identify with my friends of many years, the old gods. As for the new ones of Mr. Gaiman, the ones i struggle with in my mundane life are much better defined. It is neither dark enough nor comical enough to be called 'dark comedy'. It really is no \"Barton Fink.\" I also found it somewhat too American. For someone who is not very familiar with American life and culture, the book will be definitely less enjoyable, and would get fewer stars from a global perspective. Also, it is definitely not for the 'monster hunter' or 'good monster/bad monster' readers.",

         "I have been a yo-yo dieter all of my life. As with quitting smoking (13 years ago) I have tried everything.  It wasn't until I read and starting following the program in The South Beach Diet Book that I understand what was wrong with all the other diets.  It's the carbs and fat stupid.  I found that even when I go on and off the entire plan, as long as I can have the protein for breakfast, I don't gain back the tremendous amounts of weight as on all the other plans.  When I follow the plan I find the loss to be significant and my body internally feels so much better.  I would like to thank the publishers for putting this out in large print for all us Baby Boomers.  It makes following the receipes so easy.  I don't have to squint at the ingredients.  I know there have been other low carb diets out their but I found them to restrictive and easy to abadoned and not start back. I would like to thank the dear doctor for his insite into the problem of fat and carbs together. The easy way of presenting the information to the readers makes it educational as well as being able to reference quickly. Thank you again.",

The writing is clever and engaging. The only thing I felt this book was lacking was an update of some sort.  Written about 11 years ago, \"Learning to Bow\" is about Japan during the \"bubble economy.\"  Japan has gone through severe economic and societal changes since then, and I wonder how much of the information is still current.  Surely, with the JET program in full swing for several decades now, the presence of foreigners is not such a surprise anymore.  Also, the place of women has gone through some significant changes since this book was written. Still, anyone planning a long-term stay in Japan should read this book.

         "This is an excellent autobiographical self evaluation of KA's spiritual ascent from, I estimate roughly a Bishop Joseph Butler point of view despite it being Catholic, through something closer to that of a liberal Unitarian Universalist. As a young nun KA describes her search for God as frustrated even though she tried to do everything correctly following the traditions of the order but while also studying literature at Saint Ann's. She suffers the inevitable loss of faith that traumatizes bright young people but significantly without proper guidance, so leaves the order and continues the search through literature and teaching. Meanwhile her physical well being deteriorates as she discovers she is epileptic and again this occurs without proper assistance from the community much to the chagrin of the doctor that finally recognizes that she has long had all the symptoms. Her career and interest lead her into a series of TV specials along with books to accompany them where she dives into religious scholarship to support her programs. This eventually leads to her publishing her bestseller \"A History of God\" where she applies her accumulated research to support tolerance and respect among the religions of the book. Hyam Maccoby she explains was a great influence. Her spiritual ascent leaves off at the end of the book with a more abstract concept of the divine and a pragmatic sense of the power of those religions to take a person out of themselves and feel compassion for others. This she concludes is the main function of religion and those fundamentalist sects that promote themselves as against other sects do just the opposite of what religion is supposed to do.  I found it a very enjoyable read since at some points of her experience I either could remember something similar in mine or those I have observed. Fortunately for me I had plenty of guidance thanks to a faculty that knew what they were doing! It must also be a significant help not having poor health as well. Thank you very much Karen for sharing this wonderful story.",

My wife, a registered clinical dietician and a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE), had me on a low fat diet \"American Heart Association\" diet for years. I kept gaining weight. We read the different low carb books and I decided, with her help, to try the South Beach Diet because it includes moderate fruits. She agreed I should try it, perhaps she had grown embarrassed because I was so heavy given her profession. Week 4. In the first phase, which I had been on for 3 weeks, I have dropped 6% of my total body weight. I seem to have leveled off for the last week as I have begun to add more things back. This is what the book predicts. I had a BMI of 32.5 and now have a BMI of 30.6. I will go back into the strict phase soon to push that even lower. I am targeting less than 25. I include 30 min of exercise per day. The best news is that at no time have I felt deprived. Week 10. I now have been in the maintenance mode for some time with a few meals where I had fries or bread that are not included in the diet. My BMI is now 29.7 which is .9 less than the 4 week reading. I am still exercising and feel great. I still do not feel deprived. A significant item in the book is the suggestion to add a sugar-free fiber supplement. I highly recommend this as well. It has made this diet very tolerable, plus adds to my satiety. My wife is now a quiet, but enthusiastic believer in this type of approach. Thumbs up Dr. Agatston, this plan works.",

         "This is an excellent book for those interested in the character of food and taste. It describes the (unfortunately) fast disappearing cooking of the old and less affluent days. I see this as the equivalent of English \"Soul-Food\".  Hard times force creativity! Prior to modern times, people used the whole beast, all parts of available vegetables, throwing away the minimum.  Slow cooking, coaxing flavours and the \"terroir\" from the ingredients.  Maybe the terrible reputation English food had came from the American troops turning up in England from 1942 onwards.  England had been under siege for years at that point, importing only fuel and munitions and other essentials, forcing people to eat local traditional foods.  Sheep that were no good for wool any longer were eaten, chicken that didn't lay, were \"retired\" and eaten. All of the cabbage was cooked, including the tough outer leaves. So old, strong flavoured mutton, stewed cabbage, rabbit, pidgeon - gamey foods were a shocking contrast to the abundant great foods in the USA. The English needed to recall the historical roots of their cooking.  I like to think \"The Whole Beast\", brings them back with some modern and international twists. Lovingly and enigmatically. Fergus Henderson has written and listed a fascinating collection of recipes and interestingly in a strange and quixotic tone. Deciphering the text and his meaning is fun.  It makes one think and search more deeply for the character of the dish, more successfully than simply listing out steps in a recipe.  The one big problem or challenge, is finding the raw materials in the U.S. But it is worth the trouble.  Full marks!",

A homely introvert, Armstrong mistook her insecurities and immature idealism for a religious calling, ran to the Church looking for the security of acceptance, quickly became disillusioned and suffered a nervous breakdown. All though the Church educated her, was patient with her doubts and accepted her to leaving, she remains to this day antagonistic to the Christian religion. Her bias and resentments to Christianity, has somehow weirdly led her to become one of the foremost academic apologists for Islam. In her work (e.g. A HISTORY OF GOD), Armstrong has always seemed unable to maintain any objectivity for Christianity and resorts to absurdly obvious double-standards wherever Islam is concerned. An overrated, under-credentialed pop scholar, Karen Armstrong needs to grow up and accept reality. Armstrong merely left the shelter of the convent for that of the university. Both hold back the harsh demands of the realities of this world. This is the true dilemma of a Karen Armstrong and all of those thousands of academics just like her. I suggest Karen Armstrong develop the courage and honesty to take a long, extended trip to the Middle East and Africa. Following this, a job working with Catholic charities should also help.",

Probably most ten-year-old boys would not be happy living in the shadow of the strange and frightening Basil. But Measle has no choice, as he is an orphan and must now live miserably in his guardian's dark, cold house. The one nice thing is the room at the top of the house that contains a most marvelous train set. Sometimes, when Basil is working on the train, he allows Measle to watch. But despite these moments of happiness, Measle is terribly nervous about something that lurks overhead and seems to be watching his every move. Measle's real adventure begins when he dares to play with Basil's train and is caught. The mad wizard, or \"Wrathmonk,\" quickly shrinks Measle to the size of one of the little village people. It doesn't take long for the clever Measle to figure out that Basil has been doing some really evil spells and that many of the \"villagers\" are real people turned into plastic. He accidentally discovers that, by feeding them carrot bits, they can become real again. Becoming real helps them all realize that perhaps together they can escape from Basil's horrible spell. However, in order to do this, they must come up with intelligent plans and face some formidable adventures. By far the most fun comes when they reverse one of Wrathmonk's spells and turn him into a giant cockroach! This is a fun little book with just the right amount of scary. Like Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, it will be an especially popular selection for grades 4 through 6. There is a sequel on the way, so the adventures of Measle and his friends are just beginning.   --- Reviewed by Sally M. Tibbetts",

         5,
         "Karen Armstrong is -- here's the word again -- an amazing woman.  Having read all of her other books with the exception of her autobiographies, I envisioned a solid academic, with cadres of graduate students pulling together masses of data for her review.  No -- Armstrong is a theological autodidact!  Her personal religious and spiritual journey has, to paraphrase one of her favorites, T. S. Eliot, said, led her to where she started only to know it for the first time.  The God she ran from as a young adult has come to greet her in a very different form -- but I'll leave the specifics of this reverse quest for you to discover for yourself. Where her earlier work was clever and provocative, Armstrong has matured into one of the most thoughtful liberal religious writers of our day. She recognizes that the world cannot be healed without dialogue, and that you cannot have dialogue without running the risk that YOU may be changed.  \"It is not enough to understand other people's beliefs, rituals, and ethical practices intellectually,\" Armstrong says.  \"You have to feel them too and make an imaginative, though disciplined, identification.\" (p. 290. As one might expect from the breadth of her writings, Armstrong draws from the wells of myriad religious traditions, identifying what this reviewer believes to be the enduring truth, the thread that unities all genuine religious searching.  She learns from her own varied experiences, grows from adversity (e.g. a failed PhD thesis; years of undiagnosed epilepsy; and, of course, her much-noted years as a Catholic religious) and confronts both herself and her culture with unfailing honesty. Although Armstrong is far from the end of her journey (one hopes), she has adopted a theology of orthopraxy, which draws her into authentic living, honoring and accepting both weaknesses and strengths.  Armstrong attempts to ground her life in the conviction that \"compassion is a habit of mind that is transforming. . . You have to be prepared to extend your compassionate interests where there is no hope of a return.\"  This reviewer is particularly delighted by her conclusion, based on her exhaustive research of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, that \"fundamentalist movements distort the tradition they are trying to defend by emphasizing the belligerent elements in their tradition and overlooking the insistent and crucial demand for compassion.\" (p. 295) These points and many others, emerge in the theological commentary that forms the final chapter in this book.  This chapter alone could form the basis for several month's active discussion. If you read no other spiritual or religious work this year -- make it this chapter.  But be warned -- Armstrong's honest exploration can be dangerous to your complacency!",

         "Shadow is a convict, surviving the final weeks of his sentence and looking forward to a return to his life and to his marriage, when he is told of his wife's death and is released early to attend her funeral. On the flight home, he meets a man named Mr. Wednesday that seems to know more about Shadow than he has any right to do. He offers Shadow a job: to protect Wednesday and work as his right hand man in the big storm that is brewing. When he accept the offer, Shadow is swept into a slice of American life that he never knew existed: a battle between the old gods, brought to America by early immigrants and now dying of neglect, and the new gods of TV, strip malls, and modern America that have been born on American soil and are steadily gaining power. In the course of the novel, the characters journey from cities to roadside attractions to small town to Indian reserves, and Gaiman explores the power in both folk life in America. The novel is as enduringly off-kilter as the roadside attractions Shadow visits, with Gaiman's edge of magic and darkness that give it gravity and purpose. The resolution to the battle between the American gods is too brief, and I don't find the premise quite as interesting as some of his other novels, but the book is an engrossing read, well written, and complex, carrying through a number of characters and concepts, as I expect from this author. I do recommend it. Ever since by surprisingly good experience with Neverwhere, I've been itching to read the rest of Gaiman's novels. American Gods was the first novel in that quest. Despite the fact that Gaiman writes in no particular genre, his work is always distinctly and recognizably his own. They investigate the supernatural within the normal, often in the form of a magical social structure that runs underneath to its mundane equivalent. In this vein, American Gods explores the supernatural world of the gods that populate American soil, arising from human inhabitants, including natives, immigrants, and citizens, but exist largely underneath daily life: in shadows, hidden out of the way, and/or wearing masks to allow them to exist undetected. Because the characters are by their nature explorations into the depths, the novel has an innate level of complexity. However, because the complexity is innate, the author isn't pushed to make the text deeper or to investigate more. As a result, the ideas are brilliant and reading the book is like discovering a new, hidden culture that exists below and adds depth to one's own, but the content of the novel lacks independent complexity, both in concept and in character. The text is interesting, unique, and original, but it lacks the total depth that I look for in what I would deem \"literature\". In other words: it's a good book, not a great one. (I also didn't enjoy the hidden world in American Gods as much as the hidden worlds of London Below and Fairie from Gaiman's other books, but I consider my own dislike for Americana a matter of personal taste.) For all of that, the plot of this novel is pleasantly complex, working at both a personal, local, and cosmic level in a few interconnected narratives. The plot lines fit together almost seamlessly and the stoyline is generally linear, so the narration isn't as complex (or as difficult) as the first few chapters sometimes make it seem. The resolutions come a bit quickly, especially in the cosmic plot (the war between the new and old gods), and the hasty conclusion, as well as the nature of the conclusion, makes the plot up until that point fall flat--not completely, but to the point where it is noticeable. It isn't a huge issue and doesn't destroy that plotline. Nonetheless, it was my biggest disappointment in the book because on the whole the other aspects--from characterization to the other plotlines--are strong. The number of concurrent stories keeps the book running at a good pace and the reader consistently interested as well as making for a text that takes more into account and so achieves a greater depth. The otherworldy aspects of the book are, as always in Gaiman, walk the line between fanciful and disturbing, and are all the more interesting as a result. The darker, more dangerous, sometimes sinister cast to the unnatural elements gives the book gravity and keeps it out of the realm of light, dismissible fantasy. Shadow as protagonist, however, sometimes detracts from the supernatural aspects: he accepts the strange occurrences too readily (a necessary aspect for the smooth progression of the plot, if somewhat unrealistic) and so, through his role as emissary between novel and reader, makes them seem too ordinary to the reader as well. On the whole, I recommend this book, both for Gaiman's unique otherworldy writing and for the unique and intelligent plot, but it didn't sweep me away in the way that some of the author's other work has. It's a good read, but not great literature, nor my favorite Gaiman novel.",

The Shop on Blossom Street books tells the story of a young woman and cancer survivor who opens a knitting store.  Offering knitting classes to attract customers, three women come to the shop to learn how to make a baby blanket.  But these three women couldn't be more different or come to the classes for different reasons which don't necessarily include learning how to knit.  And we as readers watch as these three women learn the stitches, watch their baby blankets take shape, and find themselves learning more about each other, helping each other with their projects and influencing each other's lives.  By the end of the book we find them forming lasting friendships and we know we won't soon forget these knitters. Similar to the premise of Debbie Macomber's book, Thursdays at Eight which I really enjoyed, The Shop on Blossom Street while  somehwat perdictable was a good journey and satisfying destination.  The best part is that the sequel, A Good Yarn, was recently published and I look forward to reading this shortly.",

The rotating style of the book gives each character a short chapter which continues throughout.  This adds greatly to keeping order of the characters and those around them and  avoids leaving the reader confused with all the various people.  Having knowledge of knitting causes one to smile every so often but is certainly not requisite to read this book.  This is an excellent vacation book and very relaxing to read.",

         "Like a modified Atkins...lower in saturated fats but not lowfat. You can put milk in your coffee, have dessert every night, and eat as much as you want. Of course, you can only eat so many calories of lean meats, veggies, and lowfat cheeses. Even if you eat a lot, the calories don't add up as quickly. There are enough carbs on this diet that you don't feel like you are dragging. And, you DO lose BELLY FAT first! The first week, you will notice a difference! But you do need to try their very creative and very simple recipes...the \"Mashed Potatoes\" are great, and the \"Ricotta Creme\" desserts are good especially the mocha one. I think the diet works, and it is safe enough to recommend to others. The only strict limitation is for the first 2 weeks, and you are definitely not starving. The only negative is that the book could use a little better organization or a way to present more of the info in a summary method. I felt like I missed a lot just skipping to the Foods to Include/Foods to Avoid sections and Recipes and Menu Plans(who can follow a menu plan??). Other than the way the book is laid out, I have no other complaints. Great diet!",

         "\"Ringing A baby, I stood in my crib to hear the dingy-ding of a vegetable truck approaching. When I was bigger, my mom took me out   to the street to meet the man who rang the bell and   he tossed me a tangerine... ...the first thing I ever caught.  I thought   he was a magic man. My mom said there used to be milk trucks too.   She said, Look hard, he'll be gone soon.  And she was right. He disappeared. Now when I hear an ice-cream truck chiming   its bells, I fly. Even if I'm not hungry--just to watch it pass. Mailmen with their chime of dogs barking up and down the street are magic too. They are all bringers. I want to be a bringer. I want to drive a truck full of eggplants down   the smallest street. I want to be someone making music with my coming.\" And so she is. And so she does. A great joy that accompanies a new book of poems by Naomi Shihab Nye is the expectation that she will begin reappearing at national conferences and conventions, reading aloud from her latest collection. The good feeling I've taken away with me from her past workshops is about as close as I get to church these days. A MAZE ME contains seventy-two of Naomi's latest poems. Younger teens will find these pieces easy to read and relate to. Hopefully, many will be intrigued and inspired by Naomi's ability to create poetry from such sources as a car manual, a newspaper article, a taco sign, \"the hair on the head of the girl in front of me in school,\" Julia Child's patting potatoes, or a vapor trail \"X\" that a pair of planes have inadvertently left in the sky. Being a book of \"Poems for Girls\" there are also the requisite handful of \"longing\" poems: \"High Hopes It wasn't that they were so high, exactly, they were more low-down, close-to-the-ground, I could rub them the way you touch a cat that rubs against your ankles even if he isn't yours. So yes I feel lonely without them. Now that I know the truth, that I only dreamed someone liked me, the cat has curled up in a bed of leaves against the house and I still have to do everything I had to do before without a secret hum inside.\" Despite being a guy, I really enjoyed the images and memories conjured up by these poems. Whether reading \"Visiting My Old Kindergarten Teacher, Last Day of School,\" \"Turtle\" (about the persistent creature that had walked for twenty years), or \"Across the Aisle\" (about the little girl who coughed \"every 30 seconds for seven whole hours\" on a transatlantic flight), I've repeatedly interrupted Rosemary's reading on the couch and Shari's grading papers at the kitchen table in order to have an audience with whom to share the poems aloud. \"Big Head, Big Face (what my brother said to me) If your head had been smaller maybe you woulda had less thoughts in it, maybe you wouldn't have so many troubles. This is just a guess but seems to me like a little drawer only hold a few spoons and you can always find the one you need while a big drawer jammed with tongs strings corks junky stuff receipts birthday cards you never gonna look at scrambled and mixed so one day   you open that drawer poke your hand in and big knife go   through your palm you didn't even know a knife was IN there, well, that's why I think it might not be so bad to have a little head with just a few thoughts few memories few hopes maybe if only one little one came true that be enough for you.\" Luckily for us, Naomi Shihab Nye has carefully sifted through that drawer to provide an entertaining assortment of poetic images, thoughts, stories, and yoga poses.",

The abrupt changes in setting and style can take a reader by surprise, but the payoff is in the journey. Much like SK, it's not as much about the \"plot\", as it is about the characters that the plot is happening to. It's about old gods vs. new gods, but it's not. It's about Shadow's journey. It's about history of the world, belief, archetypes of American culture, and it's not.  All of these things are present, but none of them overshadow the others. It's a great story, with great characters. Read it. It has all of the beauty of typical Gaiman prose (maybe the best \"post modern\" writer, stylistically at least), the strangeness of the best horror/fantasy/psyche thriller, and a few laughs and tears.  The plot is fluid, as is real life, and the characters remain, just as we all remain while the plots of our lives morph and change. Read it. Enjoy.",

The protagonist is a fool and you get tired of him 1/4 into the book as well as from others. There is no humour, the story and characters are flat and not interesting.

         4,
         "Winner of the 2002 Hugo award for best novel. In the story, \"Shadow\", who manages to remain something of an enigma despite being the central character of the story, becomes embroiled in a free-ranging and very surreal metaphysical/metaphorical struggle between the Gods ... both ancient and new, foreign and domestic. During the story, Shadow also undergoes an epic journey of his own, that is both physical in nature, as well as something of a spiritual \"walkabout\" of the soul. I won't say more, in order to avoid giving out any \"spoilers\". It's a great book, and it's classic Gaiman - suffused as it is with motifs ranging from ancient history and mythology, folklore, religion, archeology & anthropology, philosophy, magic (both real and sleight of hand), world travel, pop culture & music, esoteric and classical literature, and so much more. Gaiman's works resonate deeply with me, because he's one of the very few authors out there who, like me, is obviously a fan of Joseph Campbell, and an avid student of ancient mythology and folklore. Somewhere inside  me lies a part that was subconsciously planning to write a book like this one someday, and that part of me feels a slight pang of loss seeing it done first, and better, by someone else. I felt much the same way when the original \"The Crow\" movie came out, which bore many resemblances to a shadowrun character I'd been working on fairly heavily at the time. In any case, it's highly recommended. If you enjoyed \"The Sandman\", you will enjoy this novel too, because it's spiritually related in both general theme and substance. NOTE: Please be advised that the idiots who published this book included a major spoiler when they penned the blurb for the back cover ... so, my advice is that you do NOT read that blurb until after you finish the book.",

This narrow and simplistic view on my part has been somewhat comforting, after all it took a number of factors and many years of indoctrination for these folks to calmly take their lives and the lives of thousands of incidents.  I say comforting because just how many of these guys can there be?  Unfortunately this book details that the men involved in the 9/11 attacks were primarily bored, unemployed and living in societies with significant economic problems.  They just happened to chose a course that lead them into performing the worst terrorist attacks ever.  This is concern because as the author points out , there are millions more young men in the same position that can only turn to religion for comfort and need a enemy to hate. This book gives the reader a very interesting view of some of the 9/11 highjackers.  The author writes in a way that is as captivating as a fiction book.  He makes even the most normal run down of facts interesting.  It helps that the ultimate event has so much drama surrounding it.  Overall I enjoyed the book.  It is full of facts presented without a lot of over the top reasoning about how these people hate us because of our freedom.

         "It's obvious that Gaiman has a unique writing style that is all his own and while he is skilled and the words themselves flow comfortably, I couldn't help but spend the entirety of the book feeling bewildered and confused.  The confusing thing wasn't the writing, but rather the story itself, which was so incredibly surreal that it left my head hurting. Even now I sit here with a furrowed brow a little conflicted about what to tell you concerning this book.  Thus I will give you this:  - oddly enough the best character development surrounded the supporting cast rather than the protagonist who was flat and under-developed.  I didn't care much about his outcome.  Part of what caused me such bewilderment on this one is that he seemed to have almost no or completely inappropriate emotions about some pretty profound things that affected him within the story.  It made him seem like a cardboard cut-out.  - rather anti-climactic story-line overall.  The book seems to revolve around a series of events that almost happen.  That's the only way I can describe it.  It's very strange.  - I'm not against sexuality or language within a story in so far as it supports the story and builds characterization (my favorite books are the Song of Ice and Fire group by George R. R. Martin which belive me, have their fair share) but I felt like there was a good bit of profanity and sexuality present here simply for the sake of its presence.  - other than that the story was fairly well written and has a distinct style that would be well recieved if the overall plot of the book and design of the characters was more definitely fleshed out. In conclusion, while the author shows that he has skill and talent, his story played out in my mind with blurry edges and no definition, leaving me feeling a little drunk and bewildered.  I can't decide whether I'd recommend it or not so I give it three stars - right in the middle, which is where this story lives.",

I was a fan of Sandman and Good Omens (co-authored with Terry Pratchett, who I also strongly reccommend) before I read American Gods, and I like the way he takes different mythologies and recombines them into a new story, even when it's not entirely true to the original myth. This book continues that theme, and it does so wonderfully. If you know your mythology, you'll have a fun game of hide-and-seek with all the gods he's packed in here- some of them are fairly obscure, and I don't think there are any of the more popular Greek or Roman gods mentioned.

Big fans of Caravaggio will be disappointed to find that 'Supper at Emmaus' for example is missing entirely. Also missing is an annotated index of the artist's works.

Other good places to start if you've never read any Gaiman include Good Omens and/or Smoke & Mirrors (short fiction.) One thing about American Gods that amused me quite a bit was the fact that large chunks of it are set in my home state of Wisconsin.  It's hard to tell if Gaiman did field research here or if he got most of his information from an atlas and Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home Companion.  Dairy cows, cranberries and the Packers are never mentioned, so that's a knock against authenticity, but the main character eats a pasty in northern Wisconsin so that makes up for things. I listened to this book on CD and so, a few remarks on that...  George Guidall does his customarily amazing job with the read.

         "This novel concerns a battle between the old gods of the old country, mainly from Norse mythology, and the new gods of internet, credit cards, and television. They are getting ready for a showdown, a battle to end the battles. In America, the old gods are dying and the new gods are taking over. Mr Wednesday (Wotan) enlists former convict Shadow to help him through the battle. Shadow doesn't quite know what he is getting into, but goes along since his wife died with his best friend in a car accident before he was released from prison. There are some asides in this book, short stories in their own right, philosophical meanderings about the death of the old gods and what this means. Ultimately, we are told that the individualistic streak in Americans, where everyone can pick and choose their own philosophy and creed, is what is causing the death of the old gods. There are many different directions to go with this. The idea of this novel are brilliant, and the meticulous research is obvious. Mr Gaiman did his homework here. But the problems are manifold. The ideas may be great, but Mr Gaiman doesn't go anywhere with them. The characters are very flat, and Shadow, as the lead, is about as dull as it gets; almost as if Mr Gaiman had decided on casting a literary Keanu Reeves for the part. The second major problem with the book is Mr Gaiman`s prose. As flat and uninteresting as the characters he draws, the style has the pretensions of being literary but doesn't come anywhere close. (See The Club Dumas, which has excellent style and a great story but was completely ignored by the fantasy community, and The Horned Man by James Lasdun, which will likewise be ignored.) His constant references to other writers and titles is forced and extremely annoying. It is far too self-conscious, a literary game of \"look at me! I know who these writers are!\" (An aside here; this type of thing seems to belong the fantasy, science fiction and horror genre more than anywhere else.) Mr Gaiman often uses his characters as mere mouthpieces for his holier-than-thou proselytizing, a device straight out of Heinlein. Mr Gaiman seems to want to be a literary writer and a great storyteller. Mainstream popular writers often feel that this is impossible, but the market is rife with novels that have tremendous style, timeless stories, and authors who do not put their egos in the reader's way. Mr Gaiman seems to be a good story-telling writer (but not much in this book) but not a literary writer.",

         "The series of books Eminent Lives being produced by General Editor James Atlas for Atlas Books, a division of Harper Collins is a true project that fills a vital need in the paucity of the arts education in this country at present.  Coupling excellent writers with biographies of great people is long overdue and after reading Francine Prose's very fine but succinct evaluation of the life of painter Caravaggio the reader will want to collect all of the volumes of this educational and enlightening series. Though there are many huge tomes readily available on the art and the wild life of Michelangelo Merisi (da Caravaggio) that offer a much more complete view of the great artist's artist output and more detailed accounts of his sexual life  and his criminal life involving the church and the state throughout Italy during his relatively brief life (1571 - 1610). Francine Prose  approaches her subject more as a novelist than as reportage.  She covers the important aspects of Caravaggio's influences, his beginnings, his particular gifts of painting that incorporated models form the street to depict religious icons, his miraculous understanding and reproduction of light and shadow, and his propensity to follow his hedonistic needs in lieu of being faithful to his career. This is a physically small volume (perfect for tucking into the jacket pocket or purse for reading away from home) and therein lays its main drawback: the few reproductions of paintings that serve to underline Prose's commentary  are too small to satisfy the art lover.  But for those images there are many monographs surveys available that may serve as adjuncts to this concise Eminent Life.  Recommended. Grady Harp, January 06",

         "Francine Prose's charming brief introduction to the life and art of Caravaggio simply doesn't belong in the Eminent Lives series--not because he was unworthy.  Rather, the spartan production standards of the series precluded including enough of his art to give a reader even a clue as to what the author was describing.  For example, her descriptions and analyses of \"The Fortune Teller\" and \"The Card Sharps\" were really quite good, but without the paints near at hand, most readers will find it difficult to appreciate them. Obviously, anyone familiar with his art would hardly buy an introduction to it; lacking appropriate illustration, the volume is unlikely to add to the ranks of Caravaggio's admirers.",

         "The gods are born by the human decision to worship them, live as long as they are remembered, and die if they are forgotten: The idea is at least as old as Richard Garnett's \"Twilight of the Gods\" short story. So what happens to gods when they become casual memories, no longer worshipped but lingering at the edge of consciousness? Gaiman would suggest that Odin is the oldest American god who has not passed entirely from our memory, having arrived with the first Viking visitors (unless Gaiman is doing a bit more with prehistory and that mammoth skull than I caught in one reading; I *think* that god is dead). He's also going to let us know {warning: very slight spoiler} that the American Odin is not the same as the Scandanavian one, though they were once the same (new conceptions of the gods become, in effect, new and separate gods). So we know the old gods, Odin and all the rest of those folks from a variety of traditions. And we meet a few of the new gods, like the TV set and the 'net and 'Media' and maybe Elvis (a fun touch: do we meet Elvis or not? Gaiman does mention his name). The plot? Oh, these gods are going to have a war, and our protagonist is going to find himself in the middle of it. That, and a subplot or two, serves to hold our interest as Gaiman invites us to join in his cynical reflection on American values: What are our gods? Do we have any who are worth our thoughts, let alone our worship? On the surface it's a good story, an intriguing fantasy piece with a cynical message. It also has a bit of depth -- the protagonist is named 'Shadow' with good reason, and more shadows than him lurk in the background of this book.",

         "This was the second Neil Gaiman novel I read.  Coming off of the high that was the magnificient Neverwhere, I hungrily started reading American Gods. The concept is definitely interesting, that the gods from history dating back to Odin are still alive and well.  Having fallen from public eye and mind, they are reduced to almost nothing.  Meanwhile, the new things we worship, TV internet etc have become more powerful gods and there is a war brewing. The novel, however, is slowly plodding as it builds a very large web of characters.  It's part road trip, part fantasy and at times partly boring.  Mostly it's because there is a very slow build up of tension as Gaiman introduces characters, ploys and plots.  It isn't until the midpoint where something huge happens that the novel truly takes off.  But even when it takes off, it does it at its own pace.  The payoff at the end, however, is spectacular and ties up the story really well. Fans of Gaiman will enjoy this novel.  I think, for me, the problem was coming off such a high given by Neverwhere that whatever I read next couldn't possibly live up to it.  It's still a really good novel.  It's not his best but it's an enjoyable read and has some great commentary about out culture and religion.",

         4,
         "The premise of Neil Gaiman's book is not particularly original: at least 2 original series Trek episodes (\"Who Mourns for Adonis?\" and \"Squire of Gothos\") are basically the same idea.  To wit: the gods are real, and they walk the Earth.  They grow powerful when people worship them, weaken when indifference sets in, and die when people forget them.  However, to my great delight, Gaiman has created a novel unlike any other - part travelogue, part suspense-thriller, and part action-adventure.  There is also an ample sampling of humour. Perhaps the most original part of the book is the selection of gods Gaiman chooses.  Some will be known to most readers - Odin, Easter, Jaquel (the Egyptian god with the head of a Jackel), and Kali (made famous for my generation by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). But many more were completely unknown to me.  I was reminded of the quote, \"stealing from one person is plaigerism, stealing from everyone is genius.\"  Gaiman selects a few gods from many different pantheons and throws them together on a quest - to defend themselves from the hostile takeover by the new gods of Television, the Internet, etc. Such a synopsis makes the novel sound silly, but somehow Gaiman makes it work and lends it the gravity it deserves.  After all, if it's one thing that the old gods lack, it's a sense of humour.  We are taken through the trip by Shadow, who early on throws his lot in with Odin.  His wife has been killed in a car accident, but apparently the gold coin (given to him by a leprechaun) he drops on her grave brings her back in some sort of undead state.  More than once she bails Shadow out, then disappears to take a job at a gas station because, after all, even the undead need to pay the rent! The interest and fun of the story is in the writing.  It is fascinating to see gods unknown to me, but some of his choices I have to question.  After all, wouldn't more people know Zeus than Odin, and if so, why wouldn't Zeus be the head guy instead?  Such details are only puzzling after the fact.  While reading the book, it's very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone. P.S. The book won the Hugo, even though it is patently not a science fiction story.",

I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up the book and I did so solely because of a good review. It turned out to be just the kind of thing that I love - the past and the present, the myth and the facts, the evil and the good, the real and the surreal rolled into one giant, wild ball that takes you on a fantastic downhill ride. You have to know your history, you have to know a bit about mythology and  you have to let go of rationality to enjoy this one. Very well written, fluent and delightful to read. Yes, there are cases when the most rational reader will raise an eyebrow and find the given events too absurd for a good, logical book, but if you take the whole thing as a fantasy journey and assume the logic of dreams instead of the logic of the waking world, it fits like a glove. Not a simple, action packed thriller, by all means! Buy it only if you have enough patience to try to see what lurks beneath the surface of the apparent words. Similar and yet different to this one, is \"Lord of Light\" by Roger Zelazny. Actually there is not much of a similarity except the ingenius work at hand and the tackling of the concept of gods and how it would be if we assumed them to be less perfect than what they are said to be.

         "Former Enron advisor Paul Krugman is an ardent follower of the discredited Keynesian school of economics, and his writings on the economy are chuck full of Keynesian nonsense. John Maynard Keynes - a product of early 20th century - believed in a big, activist government, expensive government programs, and high taxes.  Like Keynes, Krugman truly believes that any country can tax itself into prosperity as long as it spends the funds on social programs (often called \"infrastructure\".) This theory of economics fell on hard times during the great depression.  Despite Keynes' best writings, massive government spending and make work social programs did not result in full employment and monetary liquidity.  The relatively austere economic policies of the United States in the years since put the lie to Keynes' theories. However, like many so called economists who hawk warmed-over Keynes, Krugman is not really an economist, but a newspaper columnist for the New York Times.  He is a Big Government Liberal in the mold of Roosevelt and Johnson.  Smaller government and lower taxes makes him mad, even if the unemployment rate is at historical lows. Where Krugman really gets it wrong is his evaluation of Alan Greenspan's performance as Fed Chairman.  Where Krugman praises Greenspan's performance during the Clinton Administration, he accuses Greenspan as being an enabler for the Bush tax cuts. Therein Krugman exposes himself as a rank partisan writer, not an economic thinker.  The Clinton Administration's budgetary and economic policies were positively anti-Keynesian and ran against Krugman's desire for government economic activism.  Under Clinton, government got smaller, spent less than it took in, and cut back on social programs.  Pay that no mind, because Clinton raised taxes to Krugman's applause.  While Krugman praises Alan Greenspan's Clinton era performance, Alan Greenspan foolishly pursued a tight monetary policy and drove the country into a recession for no reason whatsoever before the end of Clinton's presidency. Conversely, under Bush, government is spending like a drunken sailor on shore leave, which a good Keynesian like Krugman should like, but since Bush cut taxes and Greenspan went along with Bush on it, Krugman thinks Bush's and Greenspan's performances are bad. Like Krugman's good friend and fellow New York Times columnist Marueen Dowd, Krugman wakes up every morning looking for a reason to bash Bush, not thinking about reasonable economic policies.  For Krugman to continue to pawn himself off as an honest economist amounts to fraud.",

Secondly, the story is fascinating.  Mixing ancient mythology (a hobby of mine) and great story-telling, he weaves a yarn which works on many levels: sociological commentary on mankind, modern fable, and so on. His style is good, although he's perhaps no Bradbury or Cervantes; but the story is so compelling and his imagination so engrossing that I cannot but highly reccommend it.

So, the novel ambles along and occasionally becomes downright boring.  Gaiman is at his best when telling stories of the old gods - his gift is clearly his ability to construct an intriguing narrative - but he is at his worst when characters actually have to speak to one another. Dialogue often sounds forced, particularly when Gaiman attempts to have them speak \"American\" English.

         "Those disturbed by intemperate language or emotionally-charged critiques of the Bush regime would do well to consider this excellent essay collection.  Krugman's clear logic and firm analyses of economic, social and political policies are incisive and illuminating.  Bush's rise to power and actions since achieving the presidency are a \"conservative revolution\".  Krugman sees this regime as casting away long-held American ideals, fomenting class strife in a traditionally classless society and embarking on foreign policies disdainful of global reaction.  Bush clearly holds the mass of American society in comtempt, showing favouritism to a limited group of the powerful.  Using fear as a primary weapon, Bush's team has assaulted the financial structure, the environment and even American culture itself. As an economic scholar, Krugman opens the series with essays on economic policies - banking, corporate greed and dollar politics.  He examines the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s and draws vivid parallels with the path America is taking.  He sidesteps the \"everything will be all right - just trust us\" mode of economic thinking.  He probes into promises and the underlying realities with a surgeon's skill.  What he exposes is equally stomach-churning.  The American economy, notwithstanding the shrill declarations of the Bush administration, is teetering on the brink.  Krugman's descriptive exposure of Bush mathematics ranges from \"fuzzy\" to \"false\".  Not encouraging for the future. The Bush fallacies, Krugman argues, lie on the backs and wallets of the American populace.  And these deceptions go beyond purely economic issues.  In the 1930s, another revolutionary's rise to power was greeted by many as a welcome relief from bombast.  \"He will be forced to temper his earlier pronouncements\".  Krugman shows how the Bush campaign and administration has foisted the same self-deception by the American public and media.  Abetted by the WTC attacks, Bush has wrapped himself in the flag, insulating his declarations from criticism or complaint.  The immense switch from a budget surplus to deficit was excused by the needs of the \"war on terror\".  Krugman deftly dissects that argument, displaying the fallacies of logic and fact the public is expected to swallow.  Rights are curtailed, monies diverted to special interests and presidential power is unconstitutionally enhanced.  It is, Krugman stresses, a time of a \"conservative\" [read \"reactionary\"] revolution  overthrowing long-standing American traditions.  \"Yes, Virginia\", he says, \"there is a right-wing conspiracy\". The 1930s revolutionary made ever increasing demands.  \"Compromise\", was known even then as \"appeasement\".  Krugman shows appeasement is a dangerous a policy.  Failure to curtail unreasonable demands only leads to further demands.  The greedy revolutionary cannot be satiated.  In Hitler's day, the issue was \"lebensraum\" - the quest for more living space.  Today, the issue is domestic power over the population, permitting adventurism abroad.  Now it's not just \"lebensraum\" but \"corporate lebensraum\" - resources access and unlimited opportunity to exploit them with minimal return for the privilege.  Then, the appeasers were the politicians of Western Europe.  Today, to Krugman's dismay, it is America's media.  Informing the public was once the traditional role of the media.  Now it is the propaganda tool of corporations with control by only five corporations.  AOLTimeWarnerGeneralElectricDisneyWestinghouseNewsCorp as Krugman deems it.  This unity reflects the group's alliance as an administration voice.  Dissent, a long American tradition, is now curtailed at the source.  Bush's policies are excused, supported, even promulgated by a media sharing the exercise of power over the general population. While it might seem an essay collection stretching back several years would strike a discordant chronological note, this is not the case here.  By assembling a string of columns, Krugman offers reminders of events that affect us now.  Topically arranged, this anthology provides continuity that might otherwise be lost unless you've taken the trouble to collect his work.  Krugman is a serious thinker and he's seriously concerned with issues that have meaning to us all.  As the world's most powerful nation, it is foolish to assume America's problems lie wholly within her borders.  American policies have a distant reach and have already been implemented with military might.  In line with any military environment, control of policies, resources and thought are part of the Bush agenda.  Bush wants the world to be \"like America\", but if that model stands on shaky ground, its not a pattern other societies want to follow.  Krugman has pointed out the problems, but declares that it's up to the American people to set things right themselves.  These are not problems that will be overcome by a new version of \"Crusade in Europe\". [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",

I just got the feeling when I read it that after the well-deserved success of Neverwhere he felt he had to write something similar for the US market. Neverwhere dealing with London, UK. It was kind of obvious to me that he is not as familiar with the mystic and magic of the US as he is of London. The American Gods of the book are surprisingly poorly developed, and he chooses Odin as one of the main protagonists, which gives a bit of a tired feeling to me. On the other hand, the description of the restless wife and the protected American small-town are truly chilling and up there with his best.",

A man finds himself in the midst of a battle between old gods long forgotten and new gods. Whoa! Seemed like heavy stuff. The narrative is good. Shadow's whimsical sarcastic sense of humor had me laughing out loud at times (most memorable was the scene where he meets the raven). The book reminded me of Clive Barker's early fantastique novels (Weaveworld, Great and Secret Show, Imajica) where ordinary people became embroiled in matters involving other worlds. The problem with American Gods was there really was no plot so much as a pattern: 1.) Hear about the upcoming storm 2.) Move to a new location 3.) Hide 4.) Get discovered. 5.) Repeat. So, along the way, we meet interesting characters (human and non-human), but nothing happens to propel the story forward. The only reason that I didn't quit the book early is because Shadow is a likable character and you do want to know how certain relationships end, if they do at all. 3/4's of the way, Gaiman finally writes \"And so the storm began.\"  I won't say anything about the storm, other than \"That's it!?\" But Mr. Gaiman could have turned a great premise into a cool book",

         "From the first chapter, the things that struck me most about \"American Gods\" was the similarity to Stephen King's writing style in some of his more mediocre horror books. Like King, there are wonderful, creative ideas (old gods walking the Earth; new gods taking over for ideas like mass media and the Internet). Like King, there are diverse characters with layers of issues (the main character, Shadow, develops a rather unique relationship with his dead wife, a plot perhaps more interesting than the earth-shaking main device). Like King, there is a tendency toward adolescent melodrama (note especially how Shadow's wife dies). Like many of King's novels, the ending fizzles.  Perhaps there was nowhere to go that would live up to the incredible ideas presented earlier in the book, or perhaps others were satisfied with the (thoroughly foreshadowed, yet still somewhat disappointing) \"twist\" at the end. (**SPOILER**: I would have loved to see the effect upon the world when some of the modern gods bought the farm--does the loss of the god of strategic arms limitation pacts immediately dissolve such pacts and ensure a new arms race?  This would have given the events toward the end a more epic feel, though perhaps Gaiman wanted something closer in tone to the very last scene, which was somewhat reflective and more interesting than the entire second half of the book.) The book did get me to do some research on mythology, though:  some of the \"name that god\" you will inevitably play while reading the book is very enjoyable, and the amount of research put into the characters is stunning. Don't expect the great American novel:  expect an above-average action read.",

He still had a lot to learn when he wrote this first book. I thought the story was all right, but there were some things about his writing that gnaw at me. Mr. Lehane seems to tolerate clich and imprecisely chosen words in his descriptions all too often. Its annoying, and I wonder why he does this. Does he get tired? Is he in a hurry? I don't know, but heres what I mean. He writes: I picked a dark blue, double-breasted Armani from my closetone of several I received from a client in lieu of cash, found the appropriate shoes, tie, and shirt, and before you could say, GQ, I was looking good enough to eat. Good enough to eat. That's not very cute or fresh. It distracts the reader like a sore thumb. And this: The young doorman, with cheeks so smooth he must've skipped puberty altogether, opened the heavy brass door and said, \"Welcome to the Ritz Carlton, sir.\" He meant it, too, his voice trembling with pride that I'd chosen his quaint little hotel. I truly cant imagine any doormans voice, young or old, actually trembling with pride, can you? I think this is an example of a writer trying too hard to write. If Mr. Lehane were truly in the scene, he wouldn't observe this or write it. Another thing: the Ritz Carlton (there is one) is not a quaint little hotel. It just isn't, and it is jarring to hear it characterized that way. Its not important; its just unnecessarily wrong. And this: My shoes clacked with military crispness on the marble floor, and the sharp creases of my pants reflected in the brass ashtrays. Okay, there are floor standing brass ashtrays. Some are columnar and very shiny. They distort what they reflect and its not a likely place to observe the sharp detail of sharp creases in ones pants. You wouldn't. Just one more: He crossed the carpet in three long strides, his Jack Kennedy smiled extended just behind his hand. I took the hand. Hi, Jim.\" I imagine floating dentures, hovering in the air behind his hand. I know he doesnt mean this, but say it properly, please. Mr. Lehane is getting to a clever observation, but he bungles it. I got by all this and more of the same to generally enjoy the story. I just wonder, with a little frustration, why this author doesnt take the time to polish his work before releasing it. In a practical sense, he doesnt have to, I know. Many readers don't notice these kinds of flaws and could care less.

So what's going on? What's this gang at dot.gov.whitehouse up to? As Krugman puts it: Put it this way: Suppose that you actually liked a caste society, and you were seeking ways to use your control of the government to further entrench the advantages of the haves against the have-nots. What would you do? One thing you would definitely do is get rid of the estate tax, so that large fortunes can be passed on to the next generation. More broadly, you would seek to reduce tax rates both on corporate profits and on unearned income such as dividends and capital gains, so that those with large accumulated or inherited wealth could more easily accumulate even more. You'd also try to create tax shelters mainly useful for the rich. And more broadly still, you'd try to reduce tax rates on people with high incomes, shifting the burden to the payroll tax and other revenue sources that bear most heavily on people with lower incomes. Meanwhile, on the spending side, you'd cut back on healthcare for the poor, on the quality of public education and on state aid for higher education. This would make it more difficult for people with low incomes to climb out of their difficulties and acquire the education essential to upward mobility in the modern economy. And just to close off as many routes to upward mobility as possible, you'd do everything possible to break the power of unions, and you'd privatize government functions so that well-paid civil servants could be replaced with poorly paid private employees. It all sounds sort of familiar, doesn't it? Where is this taking us? Thomas Piketty, whose work with Saez has transformed our understanding of income distribution, warns that current policies will eventually create \"a class of rentiers in the U.S., whereby a small group of wealthy but untalented children controls vast segments of the US economy and penniless, talented children simply can't compete.\" If he's right--and I fear that he is--we will end up suffering not only from injustice, but from a vast waste of human potential.

Ethel was guilty only of being a dedicated wife.  Whittaker Chambers, it has been proven beyond a doubt, lied to save his own skin.

Unlike other of his books however, in 'A Drink Before the War,' there were no surprises.  With consummate skill, Lehane drew me into the ugly world of this story until I was completely engaged in reading - Indeed, so much so, that I have strong feelings about it and am challenged by reviewing it.  The injustices (racial, abuses of power and wealth, infidelity, sordid victimizations, extortions and more) are rampant throughout, and Mackenzie and Gennaro (Lehane's central figures and private investigators, key in other of his books) prevail in a morass of dirty politics and gang warfare.  My personal dilemma is that I'm troubled when a book (or film) causes me to accept - even root for - things that I know are wrong.  I found myself rooting for vigilante justice as this book progressed.  I can't hold Lehane responsible for that - It's another testament to his skill as an author.

The book is ostensibly one man's story being told against the backdrop of some rather grandiose events, but at times it feels like it's actually a patchwork of random short stories that couldn't quite stand on their own.

Strangely, the SANDMAN comic, written for a medium that is usually dismissed as children's fare, is much more intellectual than his novels, which contain much adult fare (sex, blood, violence, etc.) but are hardly constructed on an adult reading level. Gaiman's basic premise definitely got my attention: the last showdown between the gods of old civilization and the so-called gods of modern America.  Sounds great... in fact, the whole plot of the novel is a lot of fun.  The problem is that it is carried out in such an amateurish and lackluster fashion.  Gaiman incorporates many tired standards into this novel to further the plot, give foreshadowing, or whatever.  He of all people should know better!

I would love to describe the story, and will attempt to, although this book may just be one which has to be experienced to be believed.  It is somewhat a tale of a man caught in a battle of ancient gods from mythology like Odin, and includes bar brawls with leprechauns and such.  The lead character is hired to be an \"errand man\" for a forgotten \"god\" trying to battle American society's new \"gods\" of television, technology, and the Internet, which are brought to life as actual beings.  The author does such a tremendous job of weaving the story from the viewpoint of a man so deeply haunted by a recent loss and betrayal that what he experiences in the supernatural is almost taken with a calm disinterest.  The story weaves back and forth with lightning speed between dream, reality and the supernatural, leaving a dreamy feeling while reading. Also dispersed throughout the book are, out of nowhere, brief description of other \"gods\" and events, which read like a rich tapestry of history to a degree where I was looking for footnotes.  I will say this; Mr. Gaiman has an incredible imagination! This is a rather strange book, it is at times a page-turning, stay up all night to finish novel, and at other times goes a bit too far into the horror and graphic depictions of a Stephen King.

Little details about all the deities takes up most of the space in the book and not enough attention is paid to the 'modern gods'. And why would gods like Odin and the rest even remain at all? The only example of a modern day pagan god that seemed believable in the slightest was that of Eostre, which was humorous in depicting our fascination for mumbojumbo (I wonder if she is in league with Deepak Chopra?). Nope, sorry, I just can't swallow this whole theory of the importance of mythological characters.  Greed, technology, media have ALWAYS been important to people.

         "American Gods has an imaginative premise and the writing is fairly good, and I have given it points on that aspect, however one must be well versed in suspension of disbelief in that the characters have little resemblance to real people and the convoluted murkiness of plot requires great perseverance to achieve much reward. While you may gather this sort of story is not my usual cup of tea, I have had others whose opinions I value tell me they enjoyed it immensely, and therefore perused it. I find it always difficult to remain objective when the object of discussion, a book or movie, is experienced in a subjective fashion. My antipathy to this particular novel was engendered rather soon by the protagonist's depiction as an ex-con who seemed emotionally blocked in certain areas and fixated in others, yet for all his pragmatic experiences in prison and solid grounding in reality, he accepted with equanimity the most bizarre turn of events that defied all logic, even if couched in a Lord of the Rings setting. I realize this is a fantasy story, but still, when dealing with humans, one must assume there is such a thing as a normal reaction response to outrageous incidents. Shadow's lack of normal reactions seemed to remove him from concern by the reader, in other words, you just don't care what happens to him. And, while I can accept the conceptual fantasy idea of ancient Gods being worshiped in olden times and other lands and actually living among humans, I find it difficult to rationalize them working in, say, a slaugterhouse stunning cattle or running cheap cons to make a living. Either you are a God or you aren't, and if you are, you should be able to avoid such lowly endeavors no matter how many people still believe you exist, otherwise you're just another mundane human with delusions of grandeur. The powers they retained, while minor, still should have enabled them to move out of the slums. And the new breed, hip-hoppers with a bit of magic, seemed a weak effort. But again, I am not a fan of overly-complicated plots that seem to go nowhere nor accomplish much for the majority of the book, no matter how unique the concept or how well they are written. I feel characters should be somewhat realistic so the reader can relate to them in some small manner. However, that said, if you enjoyed King's Dark Tower books, or even The Stand, then you might also enjoy this novel as it follows the general form quite well, a basic good versus evil premise complete with outrageous and eccentric players as seen through a veil of fog that clouds one's ability to make sense of things -as though Lamont Cranston was hiding behind your Lazy Boy as you read. I occasionally felt somewhat like I had wandered into the Winchester House and climbed a series of stairways that ended nowhere, feeling a momentary pang of regret that Ray Bradbury and Poul Anderson aren't still producing the volumes of quality fantasy they once did. -Barker Reviews",

         "American Gods deserves, for the most part, the Bram Stoker Award for best novel it won earlier this year from the Horror Writers Association. Neil Gaiman's twilight-of-the-gods epic/Great American Novel is a long, rollicking romp that reads like part Dickensian potboiler, part picaresque road novel, and part modern-day apocalyptic fable.  Commendably, it somehow manages to be both fun and ponderous. Gaiman, creator of the Sandman comic series and author of the previous novel Neverwhere, has succeeded where not many dare to venture. Reminiscent of Stephen King's classic good-vs.-evil epic The Stand, American Gods asks what might happen if all of the dead and dying gods from the word's oldest religions were to take one final bloody stand against the modern gods of the Internet, technology and international commerce. The spoils of the war? Our belief, of course. Our hearts and minds. The novel's protagonist is a large, deceptively oafish man named Shadow who has recently been released from prison. No sooner does he gain his freedom than he discovers that both his wife and best friend have just been killed in a gruesome automobile accident. On his plane ride home to attend the funerals, Shadow meets a mysterious older gentleman named Wednesday. The stranger, who might very well be a modern incarnation of an Old Norse God, makes a proposition to Shadow. It's an offer that, despite its dire consequences, Shadow can't refuse. Shadow is a simple man whose unending passion for his dead wife and fascination for card tricks and sleight-of-hand make him a pitiable, almost childlike character. So why, if he has all the appearance of a pawn, is he being treated like a king? For reasons unknown to himself, it soon becomes clear that Shadow will play a major role in this upcoming war of the gods. As the storm of the millennium quickly approaches, he must search inside himself for the fortitude needed to play ball with the big boys. American Gods is really two or three smaller novels sewn together with the sturdy thread of an ambitious premise and some weighty themes that touch on the roots of faith, myth, and the human identity. Some of the pieces prove more successful than others. I enjoyed the small-town horror novel stuck in the middle of this large dark fantasy epic, but felt it threw a snag in the pacing. And yet even the weaker aspects of this large novel can't detract much its overall force. Writing a book like American Gods is like pointing out to the bleachers when you step up to the plate. The pressure's on to deliver the goods. So, did Neil Gaiman hit a homer? Did this Brit manage to write the Great American Novel? Let's say the ball hit the top of the fence and bounced over. (I should mention, as an aside, that my paperback copy started falling apart on me when I was about 150 pages in; I tend to be very easy on books, so I wonder if this was a general manufacturing problem, and if other people experienced this as well.)",

I couldn't believe someone who wrote something as good as \"Water for Elephants\" could write something as--well, not good--as \"Riding Lessons.\" Unfortunately, I have to agree that the main character, Annemarie Zimmer, is so annoying that halfway through the book I was rather hoping she would fall on her head again and save everyone a lot of grief. In fact, there really wasn't really a likable character in the whole book, except perhaps veterinarian Dan, but he's kind of a wimp, and the Dressage trainer, who is a nice enough guy but why is he even in the story? I think he was supposed to provide some sexual tension (after all, he's French!), but it didn't really work. I actually felt some sympathy for Annemarie's husband, Roger, for enduring 20 years of marriage to this basket case. Sara Gruen has proven that she can craft a very good book, and I'll be interested to see what else she publishes in the future, but I think I will pass on the next Annemarie Zimmer installment.",

         "In this lively biography John Guy has produced a new, thoughtful, and very well researched, portrait of the much maligned Mary, Queen of Scots.  He has dug up records that have not been used by historians in over 100 years and for the first time fully reviewed all the original documents relating to the death of her husband Darnley and come up with some very interesting results. Mary comes across as an intelligent, well educated, politically astute woman when she finally took her place on the throne of Scotland.  It's often easy to overlook the fact that for close to 5 years she successfully ruled Scotland and its plotting Lords in her own name before the dramatic events which shaped her eventual fate took place.  John Guy successfully puts these years of successful rule in their place and presents a version of the death of her husband Darnley that makes a great deal of sense given the evidence of this event that is still preserved in English archives. Mary's later captive years are dealt with in less detail, but the plots that eventually bought about her death are presented in with insight and detail. This biography has a lot of new information on Mary, and if you are interested in this complex and tragic historical figure then this book is a must, and it will make you re-think some of the assumptions in earlier biographies.",

         "I must admit that the only reason why I finished this book is because I am reading it for my book club. I am so thankful that it was a library copy because I would be really upset if I had bought this book ... it was a painful novel to read and I just finished it an hour ago. I cannot express my shock that Gruen, who wrote one of the best novels I've read in some time (Water for Elephants) wrote this book. Granted this is her first novel ... and there is promise that she has come a long ways since this book. But this book is a big disappointment. If you love to read about horses and all that, you will be disappointed. This book is about a train wreck of a woman named Annemarie. Annemarie is one of the worst characters ever in the literature world as she is selfish, self-centered, self-pitying and rude. She comes home because she lost her job and her husband wanted to divorce her and plus, she wanted to help her parents since her father was diagnosed with ASL. She ends up driving the family's business into the ground, alienates her daughter even more and instead of resolving her differences with her father who was dying, she just hides in the stables and moan about how hard her life was ever since her accident. This is perhaps the weakest character I have ever come across and I do not say this lightly. She has a horrible meltdown throughout this book and it was very painful to read (I skimmed through a lot of it). Frankly, she comes across as a very spoiled, very priviledged selfish brat. Needless to say that this book is a major disappointment and even though it predictably ends well, the ending doesn't salvage a sour taste that this book has left me with.

         "Skeleton of the plot: The opening scene is an eloquent and exciting description of AnneMarie Zimmer, a nineteen year old girl, and her magnificent striped horse Harry, about to win a prestigious equestrian event. Disaster results, and the story resumes almost two decades later. AnneMarie returns to her family's equestrian center, where her father is dying. There is no question that Sarah Gruen can write, and write entrancingly well. In the case of Riding Lessons, the question is how much stable muck you are willing to wade hip deep through to get to the unlikely conclusion of the story. Not since the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew novels of my childhood have I seen an author telegraph plot twists so enthusiastically, and so much in advance. And not since.....ever, have I felt so much antipathy for the protagonist of a story. AnneMarie's grinding narcissism, belief-defying and adolescent impetuosity, and high decibel wailing, moaning, and whining simply did me in. There is a romantic angle to the plot, pitting a cartoonish pony-tailed French demi-god riding instructor against Dan, the local steadfast all around do-gooder veterinarian (he runs a rescue ranch for horses). By the end of the book, you pity the winner, and yearn to tell him to get LOTS of therapy before letting AnneMarie slip a marital halter over his head. Brief summary: the best part of the book is the glimpse into the inside world of equestrian competition and horse ownership in general, portrayed with lucid and inventive prose. The worst part? All the rest. Skip this book, and read Water for Elephants instead. If you've read Water for Elephants, quit while you're ahead.",

Well, it never happened. She never grew, never became more reasonable, never took an interest in others except how they reflected back on her. In a more mature writer's hands, this might've become a powerful portrait of a totally dysfunctional, tragic character. At some point, we lost all curiosity about how the author would redeem this character, because it was clear she wouldn't. And because she was the narrator, we never learned much of interest about any of the other characters. Eventually, it became a challenge -- could we make it to the end? We agreed if we were reading the book, we both would've tossed it across the room long ago. But we egged each other on, taking turns predicting plot twists and laughing uproariously at the heroine's self-absorbed descriptions of her trials. At the end, we both burst into laughter -- at relief we had made it all the way and at the author's ham-handed romance novel descriptions.

         4,
         "American Gods is Neil Gaiman's big 2001 \"American\" fantasy.  The central idea is an old chestnut -- that gods only live as long as they are believed in.  Gaiman modifies this by tying gods to the land, in a sense, such that gods, or a version of them, move to America when people move there.  But most of these old gods are near death -- few people believe in them anymore.  They live on in rather diminished circumstances. The central character is a man named Shadow.  The book opens as he is about to be released after three years in prison.  Just days before his release, he learns that his wife has died in an automobile accident, and the prison authorities let him go early.  On his way home, he meets a strange man called Mr. Wednesday (the significance of the name, and the man's glass eye, won't escape many people, I trust), who offers him a job.  Shadow thinks he has a job waiting, but he soon finds out that his prospective employer has died. Shadow finds himself more or less pushed to taking Wednesday's job offer.  Mostly this job consists of driving around while Wednesday tries to recruit other old gods to join him. It seems a battle for control of America is coming, between the old gods and the \"new gods\": the media, the internet, and suchlike.  So we meet a number of nicely depicted gods from the various old countries: Anansi from Africa, Bast and Osiris and Anubis from Egypt, Czernobog from Russia; and so on.  Some of the new gods begin to harass Wednesday and his associates, managing to capture Shadow a couple of times.  And Shadow meets his dead wife as well, in the corrupting flesh, and she begs him to find a way to bring her back to life.  We also get some interludes depicting the lives of some of the immigrants to America, as they bring their gods with them. A long middle section finds Shadow hanging out in an idyllic Wisconsin town, in the dead of winter.  Though even there a dark mystery may lie behind the town's peacefulness.  Finally the battle nears, and Shadow finds himself pushed to test his loyalty to Wednesday to the utmost, even into the land of the dead.  He learns some important truths about his own identity, and he learns the real secret behind the coming battle. The story is resolved both cleverly and movingly.  Shadow is both a character who grows during the action, and a character who pays a great price for his knowledge.  The end manages to surprise, as well.  I think this is one of the best SF/Fantasy books of the year.  There may be a few structural loose ends, and also Gaiman pretty much entirely avoids confronting any of the Abrahamic faiths, which seems to me to leave a conceptual hole, but the book is still powerful and involving.",

I read many of his tales, and I believe that there is no author who has his talent for creating modern legends, and modern mythologies. So saying it's his best book should give you a rough idea how much I liked this book. 'American Gods' has a main story, and a back story. The main storyline evolves around Shadow, an ex-con who is hired by an enigmatic character called Wednesday to be his bodyguard. It takes Shadow some time to realize it, but apparently Wednesday is trying to enlist many odd people all around America for a war.. these people, Shadow finds out, are in fact the old gods from various mythologies. The war is a war of old gods against the new gods... gods of the media, computers and the internet. I would not elaborate much on this storyline, because I don't want to ruin it. The back story examines ideas which Neil Gaiman likes to explore.. what is belief? what are gods? what happens to gods when there is not so much belief anymore? The book is filled with ideas and characters from so many mythologies.. I'm sure I missed many of these anecdotes, most are not explained at all. This creates such a deep background. The book has such a feeling of loss, of old passing away, and new things waiting for their own demise..  this held me captivated, I could not put the book down until I finished it.

While I enjoyed Riding Lessons, I had mixed feelings about this first effort.  Overall, I'd give this book three and a half stars. Thirty-eight year old Annemarie Zimmer has her world collapse on her when she loses her job, her husband, and she finds out that her father is dying of ALS.  She packs up her rebellious 15 year old daughter and heads back to the horse farm where she grew up in New Hampshire.  But unfortunately for Annemarie, the farm is haunted by ghosts of her childhood and a tragic riding accident that almost killed her 20 years ago.  She also has never dealt with the loss of her magnificent horse, Harry, who had to be killed as a result of the accident.  Annemarie was a world champion rider, training for the Olympics.  After the accident, she never rode again.  So not only must Annemarie deal with her father and her daughter and her divorce, she must also face the issues from her past. One problem I had with Riding Lessons is that I didn't always like Annemarie.  She seemed spoiled and self-absorbed and every time she was faced with a decision, it seemed like she made the wrong one.  The plot was also fairly predictable--especially the ending.

         "\"American Gods\" is something of a misnomer as a title since this is more acurately a story about \"Gods in America,\" most of whom immigrated to the new world as their followers trekked across the oceans to come here.  Most of this is news to Shadow, the main character in Neil Gaiman's novel, who learns his wife, Laura, has been killed in a car crash just as he was about to get out of prison.  But if you remember one thing about this novel it is that there are no accidents, nothing is coincidence, and everything has meaning.  Shadow, who has a modest talent for doing coin tricks, becomes the employee of a strange being who goes under the name of Wednesday and is warned by everyone he meets or dreams about that a storm is coming.  Soon it becomes clear that this is not an allegorical statement, but that there is a coming battle between the \"new\" gods and the more ancient variety of deity. Ultimately the sum of the parts of \"American Gods\" is not greater than the whole, and when the war of the gods ends with a whimper instead of a bang, it is an unsatisfying climax as is the resolution of Shadow's relationship with his dead wife, Laura.  Gaiman has actually done too good of a job on his research of the ancients gods, so that it becomes difficult to tell whose rules apply; are we dealing primarily with Norse mythology here or is there a more general set of rules that apply?  I am sure some academic can explain it all to us, but do not ask me and while I do not expect to be able to guess where Gaiman is going with his story, I do want to feel that this story is more than slight of hand or some type of con game. The best part of the ending was the truth of the quiet little town of Lakeside; again, the pieces fall into place, this time with a more satisfying sense of conclusion.  \"American Gods,\" despite its problems, most of which can be forgiven since Gaiman is clearly trying to construct an epic, is an interesting tale, well told.  Michael Crichton talked about a paradigm shift in \"Jurassic Park,\" arguing that science no long produces truth; Gaiman touches upon this, but without really developing the new paradigm (and its attendant gods) in significant detail.  However, through out the novel Gaiman's characters consistently captivate us even when the story becomes obscured.  In the end, \"American Gods\" is a good read.",

         "If you've read Gaiman's work before, you will recognise many of the themes in this book.  Everything about the nature of Gods -- what they are, where they come from, how they survive, and what happens when they don't -- seems to be of supreme interest to him.  As well, he is often concerned with the relationships between \"common\" mortals and the \"uncommon\" (deity, supernatural forces, etc.)and how that relationship changes a person. Gaiman certainly has the background knowledge to explore these topics!  In fact, much of his work seems to contain less truly original content than it does beautifully arranged and applied folk traditions and mythologies.  But to Gaiman, it seems that everything is a mythology, from tales of the Norse Pantheon to serial killers and black helicopters.  Myself, I see the world that way too, so it's validating to read someone else who does.  People who don't see the world that way, however, can find Gaiman's work long-winded and irrelevant. Gaiman's use of language is one the strongest points of this novel.  He uses no more words than necessary, yet combines them in exquisite pictures like \"Chicago came on slowly, like a migraine.\"  Having read _American Gods_ following a cheesy and bombastic fantasy novel, I was really refreshed! I also really liked that much of the book was set in small towns and out of the way places.  Living in a small town myself, I can say that Gaiman really has a handle on both the charms and oddities of small town America.  It's great to see that given space without being made totally sinister, as King tends to do. Some people have objected to the lack of Christian content in anything with the word \"Gods\" in it.  Similar objections were made to sections of _The Sandman's_ run.  The only thing I can say to this is, if you're a strict monotheist or a religious fundamentalist of any kind, you will probably not like this book, so don't bother. Ditto if you don't like having your idea of the world challenged, or if you just don't find questions about the nature of deity interesting.",

         "I've been a fan of Gaiman's for about five years, beginning with his Sandman stuff. I've read each of his other books (Neverwhere, Stardust and Smoke & Mirrors) as they were published and eagerly awaited the next. This is his newest book and, in my opinion, the best thing he's ever done. Bit by bit: Shadow: the book's main character. It begins with his release from a short prison term, a few days early, due to his wife's untimely death. With nothing tying him down, seemingly no reason to even continue living, he accepts a job from a stranger as an aid, chauffer, travelling companion, etc. While Shadow sometimes seems like a bit of a dullard, you can't help but love him. Even following him into places that seem boring, your interest never wanes. Easily the strongest of Gaiman's main characters yet. Wednesday: main supporting character. Shadow's employer. One of the American Gods, and one of fiction's all-time coolest characters. You can't not love Wednesday, even when he comes under fire late in the book. Supporting characters: one of the greatest casts of supporting characters since...well...ever, maybe. At least that i can think of. Anansi, Czernobog, the whole town of Lakeside. The supporting characters make the book just as much fun as any of the other, bigger elements. Atmosphere: in all these reviews, not once does anyone say Gaiman's prose is bad, and with good reason. He's a master at creating atmosphere, and the only times he's ever matched the atmosphere of this book are in Neverwhere and during The Kindly Ones storyline in Sandman. And the settings (Lakeside, Backstage, all the roadside attractions) make the book a lot more fun. All in all, this is one of the greatest books i've ever read. It's up there with Tristan Egolf's \"Lord of the Barnyard: Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Cornbelt\" and Neal Stephenson's \"Cryptonomicon\". Oh yeah, and \"The Stand\". Read these books, you won't be disappointed.",

The horse details were confusing because some were very accurate, especially the physical descriptions of what a horse feels like, but some were so off.  This author seemed to not know the difference between Grand Prix show jumping and eventing.  This really bugged me.  Also, the idea that any 16 year old would compete at  Rolex (FEI 4star) is preposterous, given the number of years it takes to qualify at that level, she would have started eventing at what, age 8???  Like other reviewers I liked the fact that it didn't end with the typical \"win of the big competition against all odds\".  I was also relieved that the author didn't have the main character spring in the saddle after a 20 year absence and take up where she left off.  I spent one year out of the saddle and after my first time back I was walking like Ozzie Osbourne for four days....",

         "I have been a Neil Gaiman fan back to his days doing graphic novels.  Unfortunately, I have found that his prose, while excellent when paired with vivid art, often don't stand up on their own.  American Gods demonstates that he is matureing as an author and growing beyond the need for multi-media. Many reviewers have given far too much of this book away.  That is unfortunate and I will not repeat their mistakes.  The book is intersting and fun.  The philisophical conflicts that it embraces harken back to some of Gaiman's best work in Sandman.  The subject matter is engrossing and his strong central character is one that the reader wants to follow.  While I do not think the writing is great, it is good enough to be entertaining and carry a very imaginative story. Gaiman has a gift for vivid imagry and a seemingly endless collection of interesting factoids that continue to peek the readers interst.  This work represents a leap forward for a matureing author.  As such, it a worthwhile read.",

         "Released from prison shortly after the accidental death of his wife, ex-con Shadow finds himself free, but bereft of all the things that gave his previous life meaning.  As he bids his farewell to the fragments of that life, an eerie stranger named Mr. Wednesday offers him employment.  Wednesday needs someone to act as aid, driver, errand boy, and, in case of Wednesday's death, someone to hold a vigil for him.  Shadow consents and finds himself drawn unsuspectingly into a cryptic reality where myth and legend coexist with today's realities. Mr. Wednesday, trickster and wise man, is on a quest.  The old gods who came over to this country with each human incursion have weakened as their followers have dwindled and are now threatened with extinction by the modern gods of technology and marketing.  Wednesday travels from deity to deity, rounding up help for what will be last battle.  He engages ancient Russian gods, Norse legends, Egyptian deities, and countless others who have found their way to America in the past 10,000 or so years.  Shadow never quite understands what his role is in all of this, but he experiences visions and dreams which promise that he is far more than Wednesday's factotum. The plot is unendingly inventive as it treks its way across the country.  From Chicago to Rhode Island, and Seattle to the magical town of Lakeside, Shadow's journey seems to follow the back roads of America.  The people he meets are gritty, and the gods are even grittier.  Gaiman creates believable characters with quick brush strokes and builds vivid landscapes that belie their mundane origins.  Gaiman, recently moved to the U.S. has invited us along on his own quest to discover an America uniquely his own. This is a novel that resonates at many levels, it is Shadow's initiation quest, Gaiman's search for the American identity, a revisionist Twilight of the Gods, and last, but not least a captivating piece of fiction.  The gods that people this story came with people who found their way to this country from almost every time and place.  Gaiman has put his finger on once of this country's greatest truths.  Every person who ever lived here has roots from somewhere else.  We have crossed oceans and land bridges, on foot, and by every other means of transportation.  Our culture has been created whole cloth out of the character and beliefs of all those people.  Gaiman has managed to capture a bit of that vision and put it on display for the reader. After his superb work in \"Neverwhere,\" \"Stardust,\" and the Sandman graphic novels, Neil Gaimon has established himself a force to be reckoned with in the crossover horror/fantasy genre.  Now with his new novel Gaiman establishes his mastery in a remarkable story of quest and transformation as he comes to terms with his own vision of America.  \"American Gods\" defies classification and invites superlatives.  This is one of 2001's must reads.",

         "I've read comparisons of Neil Gaiman with Stephen King.  The comparison, I think, is unfair.  Both are good storytellers with a deft mastery of language and imagery.  However, unlike King, Gaiman does a much better job at taking us into that which lies beneath.  King only shows what is there (at least, what is there in his fantastic horrible world).  Gaiman takes us behind the scenes -- even, in this book, referring to it as Backstage. That difference may seem trivial, but it is very important.  It makes Gaiman's work more readable, more interesting, more thought-provoking. Gaiman loves looking at that which lies beneath, and \"American Gods\" is no exception.  This time around, he examines American belief in the form of the gods that were brought to this new land but, ultimately, were abandoned for the new gods of technology and pop culture.  We follow Shadow, an ex-con with a dead wife, through various American roadside attractions and through the living quarters of the old gods.  We watch as the final battle between the old and new builds up. This is, so far, the best book that I've read this year.",

Sara Gruen's RIDING LESSONS is so explosive that not only was I hooked immediately, I lost a night's sleep to finish it. I became so immersed in Annemarie's life that I was saddened when I reached the end of her story. Gruen writes with astonishing grace about several difficult issues. Her depiction of the power struggle between Annemarie and her daughter is rendered with empathy, and thankfully avoids relying on melodrama or syrupy platitudes. Annemarie's parents are vital, vibrant characters, so alive and skillfully realized you feel like you're eavesdropping on private, painful conversations. Gruen also exhibits a biting sense of humor, imbuing Annemarie with a sharp wit and fragile bravado that leads her into several comical situations. And the sequences about riding can only be described as breathtaking. RIDING LESSONS is so exquisitely written I often found myself stopping to reread sentences, just to enjoy their structure and cadence. I urge anyone who's tired of the same old stale, formulaic women's fiction to read RIDING LESSONS; I promise it'll restore your faith in the genre. I eagerly await Gruen's next effort.",

I enjoyed the word play in the book the first time I read it, especially in the letter where Snicket tell Beatrice how long he will love her. Snicket also has great fun with the word \"letter\" as in letters of the alphabet and letters you write, often mixing the two until the reader is thoroughly confused. There are tons of anagrams (some obvious and some not) as well as codes. Even the front cover has some hidden clues. There are supposedly thirteen clues in the book, I'm not sure that I found them all. But \"The Beatrice Letters\" was much more enjoyable the second time I read it because I could see how cleverly Snicket hinted at events to come in \"The End\". I was initially puzzled by the seeming differences between the letters Lemony Snicket was writing to Beatrice and the letters Beatrice was writing to Snicket - which was explained in \"The End\". Other things that are casually mentioned in \"The Beatrice Letters\", such as a ring, turn up in \"The End\". Finally, the back cover itself is a direct, humorous reference to the last book. Fans of Lemony Snicket don't have to read \"The Beatrice Letters\" to enjoy the Unfortunate Series, but it's a nice addition. There are hints as to what happened to the Baudelaires later in life, but there are also plenty of mysteries created and unsolved; a Lettergram in the book is especially intriguing. I can't help wondering if we have indeed heard the last from Snicket about the Baudelaires.",

         "I like the disc world books. They're just fun. But this was kind of a cut above the others I've read. It got me thinking. The books central theme was the difference between male and female magic. In the disc world (and possibly elsewhere) magic is a kind of ATP driving the universe forward. Female magic emphasizes harmony among people and harmony between people and nature. It has a pantheistic basis. Male magic is intrusive. It changes things, even though a change in one direction means a possibly undesirable motion in other directions. So the question I asked myself is: are there really differences between male and female creative urges? The book argues that there are such differences and you can ascribe a gender identity to each. It's just that men and women can be \"transgender.\" That doesn't mean that their activities are not \"inherently\" masculine or feminine. But I don't quite buy off on that. I think there are behavioral differences between men and women (in addition to anatomical differences.) But in the behavioral case, the differences are more imposed on us, and defined by society. We act like boys and girls because the \"meme\" for such behavior is transmitted to us by the people around us when we reach consciousness. If all of a sudden, we made an active decision to change these notions of what constitutes male or female action, we could and no rule of physics or chemistry would be violated. Its like the gender endings in German, For example masculine, feminine and neutral endings don't always appear logically assigned. This illustrates their arbitrary nature. So it is with what we call male or female roles. All this is a bit of an \"extra\" for escapist reading.",

This book is set some time after the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower from the first two novels, The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic, though it's not necessary to have read them first, and a quick introduction is enough to situate a reader in the Discworld universe. (For that matter, Pratchett fans have suggested countless Discworld reading orders other than the usual order of publication.) Though the action of the story focuses on young Eskarina Smith's efforts to become Discworld's first female wizard, the real standout character is her mentor Granny Weatherwax, a formidable rural witch who disapproves of wizardry but nonetheless supports Esk's choice to travel to the city of Ankh-Morpork and apply for admission to Unseen University. The story moves along at a good clip and is filled with Pratchett's trademark humor; he's like a witty, fantasy counterpart to Douglas Adams, though perhaps with less wryness and more warmth in his writing.

I decided there was something wrong with the way I looked at meat and bought Bones because I wanted to get back to basics and tradition.  I wanted to find ways to infuse my meals with flavor and complexity without breaking the bank or using a plethora of exotic ingredients. The layout of this book makes sense and is easy to navigate.  However, I really wish that the editors has chosen to invest in more color photography.  There are a few pictures here and there, but with a sophisticated topic such as this, I believe that they missed an opportunity to really showcase bones actually in use as ingredients.  The book feels as if it were published on the cheap which is really too bad given the audience it actually targets.  The paper itself is too pulpy & porous and retains moisture only too easily in the kitchen environment. Covering all the varieties and classes of meats, Bones delivers an education as well as a culinary challenge.  The stock recipes alone are worth their weight in gold.  There is even a small section at the back that discusses the use of marrow in desserts and even a few recipes such as Marrow Pudding and Bone Cookies.  There is much to be learned between the covers of this book and I highly recommend it to cooks of all abilities.",

         "Burma Road is really not a book about the Burma Road. It is a general and light overview of the entire Burma War. It's focus is primarily centred around the American contribution. But the great problem with this book is that the general reader would assume by its contents that America and all its actions in this war were the central actors in this Theatre. The million-person Anglo-Indian Army -- which cleared all of India in almost all of the major battles of this war is clearly underexplained. In this sense, altough a worthy effort, merely reinforces popular American mythology of how they \"won\" in this theatre of the war -- and does nothing to advance a higher understanding of how a Japanese Army of 300,000 (more than double that encountered by the American's on Okinawa) was defeated. If Donovan had started with the premise that this book was to be about the Burma Road and its place in the Burma War (as I assumed from the title of the book), then most of the battle detail is strong and certainly interesting. But in fact Webster tries to paint from a pallette describing the entire war in Burma, emphasising overwhelmingly the American contribution. While the battles leading up to the capture of Mytkiyina were brutal and certainly exciting, they are mere sideshows compared to those of Imphal, Kohima, Shaggy, Myktiela and the battle of the Pegu Yomas at the end of the war. The action and descriptions fly a little too fast and furious for my liking as well. Orde Wingate is described  (before being appointed to head special warfare unit) as the \"most controversial officer in the British Army\" -- which outside of the people who knew him was clearly not the case -- he was a minor oddball Colonel (and sometimes Major, and largely unknown) until Wavell, Slim and later Churchill picked him for greater things. There is an almost 1950s narrative history feel about his book. All battles are \"hell,\" all moves by the allies \"brilliant\" and the Japanese (perhaps the finest light infantry in the world) just a bunch of ham- fisted Banzai-charging fanatics. The situation of the Chindit defence of Blackpool was \"perfectly\" positioned -- which as any reader of history at this time knows be exactly the opposite of reality (see Michael Calvert's \"Prisoners of Hope\"). Donovan has clearly not done his elementary study of the Burma war to get this wrong. More than a few British officers lived with the infamy of the poor siting of Blackpool. Some of the narrative is factually incorrect. We have Webster numbering Japanese troops in a division to \"1000 men\" (moreover he does this at least twice in the book?!). We have him describing Mountbatten as the leader of the \"highly successful raid on Dieppe\"??? Again -- Donovan is writing about things he clearly has not read. He states that the war in Asia started on December 10th?? (Actually it started on the 08th). He states that, even as the Japanese were advancing into Burma, they were losing much tonnage as a result of the Flying Tigers (AVG) flying over the South China Sea and bombing shipping headed for Burma (again totally factually incorrect). Much later in the war the 23rd Fighter Group made raids over Hanoi, but at the beginning stages of the Burma battle the AVG never sunk a single ship.( I think that he is mixing up the missions of the AVG with the latter, much larger 10th and 14th USAAF units that certainly did wreek havoc over SE Asia). A reference to Brian Cull's \"Bloody Shambles\" - a history of air operations over Burma (or any standard study of the war) -- would have sorted him out on this point, but its not in the bibliography. In addition the massive Royal Airforce which included airmen and women for all over the commonwealth is not even mentioned. This theatre was even more complicated that others, but the intracies of this are not explained at all. In fact the Burma Road itself would have been a excellent vehicle to compare, contrast and describe the wranglings over strategy and command splitting that went on in this front. A person reading this book would be forgiven if they thought that Stillwell was Supreme Theatre Commander or even subordinate to anyone outside the US Chain of command. He in fact reported to Archie Wavell (though he did break the chain of command quite frequently). Most importantly, Webster seems to have talked with a lot of people about his subject. But by the paltry bibiography he has clearly not mastered the literature of his study: how anyone could write a book on the Burma War and not cite Louis Allan's \"Burma: The Longest War\" is beyond me. He also uses compendium Secondary Sources such as Chinnery's \"March or Die\" and Rooney's \"Burma Victory.\" The latter is again an overview book and extremely prejudicial in favour of Orde Wingate,but both do not include any original reasearch on the war. Most of the information on Stillwell was gleaned from Barbara Tuchman's tour de force \"Stillwell and the American Experience in China\" -- which gives you a better feel for the man, the campaign and the politics of this theatre. The one area I give Webster his due, is that he sorts out the niave American interpretation of the Chindits and Stillwell's opinion that \"limey's do not fight\" -- Webster explains excruciating Chindit battle for Moguang, who, unlike their American cousins, fought for four months, many times with no direct support. From 1200 fighters Brig. Michael Calvert emerged with almost 50 effectives at the end of the battle. The clearing of the Hunkwang valley was only a sideshow. In the end the British cleared all of lower Burma from offensives launched out of the Akyab corridor and the Imphal plain -- all with traditional army units (including the last Chindit operation). They cut Burma in half and forced the Japanese to withdraw from Northern Burma before utterly destroying the Japanese in the brilliant battle of Myktiela. This does not mean the honour or sacrifices of those who fought the Northern campaigns is any less than those of others -- it does however seem to vindicate British strategy. Do not get me wrong. I liked the book, but this description of the Burma War is only a very small exciting part of a very, very large war that dwarfs many of the personalities and events in this book. It is an exciting series of battles and personalities. But in sum the American contribution was local, and contributed little in the defeat of Japan in Burma. That it was glorious is beyond quesion. For those who want to know more about the Marauders I reccomend Orgill's book of the same name. For those about the American contribution on what the Americans call the CBI (not used outside of the US I'm afraid), you couldn't do better than Tuchman's \"Sand Against the Wind.\"",

         "Overall I'd say this was a pretty good book as a historical war record.  It shines the light on an oft forgotten theatre in WWII and dissects both the political and military aspects with clarity.  Even as a self-professed WWII history buff many of these details were not known by me.  So, for that I'd have to give this book high marks simply for the depth of information on this mostly unknown piece of WWII history.  The background on General Stilwell is of particular interest as the man who stubbornly ran the war against all odds.  Stilwell's army constantly faced a multitude of diseases, lack of supplies, horrible climatic conditions and a relentless enemy and the book covers these in detail, from dysentery to flying supplies over the \"hump\" to first hand accounts of Japanese banzai charges.  Handcuffed by U.S. military planners and General Chiang Kai-shek policies, Stilwell shows his mettle and does a superb job of getting things done with the little resources he had available.  I found it especially interesting that the author notes that Gen. Stilwell had first been selected to lead the D-Day invasion of Europe, but because of his unique qualifications he was chosen for the Burma-India theatre with Eisenhower instead leading the invasion or Normandy.  Could we perhaps have had a President Stilwell if he had overseen D-day and not Ike?  Some of the guerilla warfare with details of firefights was especially engaging.  At times however the book did bog down and get a bit dry with all the \"logistical\" details and I had to slog my way past that.  But, in the end it was a satisfying book.  If you're a history, military and/or political science fan, then this book is right up your alley.  If you only have a general interest in the topic, I'd probably recommend you pass.",

         "I was going to watch the movie \"The Town\", and then realized it was a novel first. So I looked it up, and found too many references to Lehane in the reviews of Hogan's work to ignore. I really liked the movie version of Lehane's 4th book, so I figured I would read about the beginning of these character's story. Let me say that my favorite books are usually epic, character driven stories. Stephen King, George R.R. Martin, Follett are among my favorites. I pick up 300-400 page novels as filler in between heavy, long stories. I enjoy and appreciate short, plot driven stories, but usually don't expect too much from them. That may be why or how I enjoy them so much. It's a quick break. Fun, or scary, or intense. I just want to feel something. I say all of this to frame my review of this book, give perspective. This may be the best 300 page novel I've ever read. It has the pacing you would expect from a short novel, but somehow the characters are much deeper than the typical short novel. I feel more connected to the characters than the plot, which is usually only accomplished in a much longer novel or series of novels. Lehane is very good at using minimal words for maximum impact. A very fast read that leaves you with the feeling you have after finishing an \"epic\" novel. I'll be reading the rest of Lehane's work in very short order.",

         "I was glad I had the opportunity to knock this book over in a couple of days. He's nicely captured the hardboiled thing, more Hammett than Chandler in the over the top level of constant danger and violence. Also no coincidence that there's a deliberate Western influence (Hammett wasn't shy of knocking out a Western alongside his crime stories, such as the excellent `The Man Who Killed Dan Odoms'), Lehane foregrounding this as his heroes head out into their high noon shootout with a couple of wisecracking cops saying, `They think they're cowboys.' `Then we'll bury them with their boots on.' Just about everyone is that much larger than life, tough hombres with gallows wit. `Bubba' is that much larger again, the sort of cartoon character that would be at home in a Terry Pratchett novel, but mostly Lehane keeps the comic thing secondary to the dark mood. The cast and plot are genre fiction staples down to their DNA, but that's just fine - Lehane successfully celebrates lots of the things I love about how you can play with this tradition. A total deal-breaker with this is you've got to be able to deliver one-liners, and Lehane gets this essential nicely. Very interesting, too, how he deals with the race thing. This has become a convention lately, probably because of the interplay of TV with books. Cop shows have had mandatory `people of colour' working (surprisingly happily) alongside white folks since the 70s. While tokenism is still rampant, some textures have been allowed to emerge over time (and this novel has far more in common with, say, `The Shield', than Starsky and Hutch's `Huggy Bear' - or the casual perfection of a `Bones' universe). The race issue is given more time, as an issue that isn't necessarily driving the crime story, than anything, with a few barely veiled editorials contained in some of the dialogue. Yet while he does give some strong lines challenging race as an excuse, he also has great relish in giving some rednecks a right kicking. I like that there's lots unresolved here, even within the hero. This is a messy area, and while Lehane condemns some extremes on both sides, he leaves it messy. And he does nothing like the appallingly twee condescension of Mark Giminez' awful `The Color of Law'. This book has so many merits I'll forgive him the almost satirical level of sexual tension: at times I felt like I was watching a `Flying High' type rip-off as yet another perfectly timed phone call, rap on the door or gunshot diverts the girl and boy millimetres away from falling into each other's arms. Is he going to maintain this for the whole series? Absurdly he might - just because sexual tension is more fun than stable relationships. Gennaro is clearly fictional but successful in her combination of vulnerability, impossible desirability, and raw courage. Her abusive marriage (spoiler) sub-plot does deliver the pleasure of a cracker come-uppance scene, but how Phil has survived until then while causing the ire of, what, half a dozen of the most dangerous badasses in the city, is a total mystery.

To give you an idea of what errors to expect: - page numbers are frequently found glommed onto the end of words, like \"with124\" - apostrophes are almost never recognized, so the software ends up interpreting them as part of a letter, so compound words like \"I'll\" become \"Tll\" I might expect this low quality from free or 99-cent ebooks that were ripped from public domain sources and thrown together by an amateur, but not from a Kindle book with a regular price over $5 (even with the occasional sale price of $2).

At least a half-dozen characters are so well defined that now, having read the book, I feel I almost know them and how they'd reaction to happy, sad and tragic events.  Most authors can't paint more than a character or two that clearly. Long passages about the atmosphere -- in this case, a rough neighborhood in a tough city -- usually leave me cold.  Lehane knows how to draw a vivid picture without falling in love with his pen.  I came away feeling like I'd visited the Flats. I don't know if there's a sequel, but if there is I'll read it.  No spoilers here, suffice it to say I'd be interested in any of several story lines that could be further explored.  That's not to say the story's not complete though.  I hate a mystery that doesn't have a proper ending.  The resolution here is logical, unpredicted (by me, anyway), true to what came before, and satisfying. I've not seen the movie based on this book.  The images in my head are already so rich I don't think I'll watch the flick. As far as the Kindle conversion itself, there are no complaints whatsoever.

This incident had me thinking... Yes, the fact that Dave got into the backseat of that car certainly resulted in changing his life.  However, if it wasn't that particular incident, there would have been another similar incident, because that was who Dave was.  Hence this question: Can a minor decision change the entire direction of your life?  Or, on the other hand, does who you are direct and mandate the changes and direction that your life takes? Twenty-five years later, Sean is a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-con; married with three daughters, and Dave is married and trying to stay on the straight and narrow, striving to live up to the image of a good-husband and good-father. Over the years, like many childhood friends, they have taken separate paths and the three had lost almost all of their childhood connections.

Most of her points arguing for the identification of the mummy, \"The Younger Woman\" in the tomb designated KV35, were published years ago by Marianne Luban, whom Fletcher fails to mention in her book.  Fletcher has a good deal to say about ancient wigs, her specialty, but has no way of proving that the wig she claims was found with the three mummies in the tomb even belonged to the mummy in question even though she makes much of this wig.  Nor does Fletcher give any scientific proof that the two unattached right arms associated with the mummy actually belong to it.  So, her \"theory\" not even originally belonging to \"her\", Fletcher has added nothing that can add any true weight as proof of \"The Younger Woman\" being Nefertiti.  Whatever her \"search for Nefertiti\" consists of--and this is a pretty ambiguous if not downright perplexing statement--it can hardly have anything to do with locating the mummy as that has been in the tomb for all these years since being discovered by Victor Loret in the 19th Century.  If one wants to learn about the life of the beautiful queen, there are certainly other books that address this much more comprehensively and Fletcher has nothing original to say about the life and times of Nefertiti, either.  Fletcher also fails to comment on the many criticisms her colleagues have asserted against her since she first announced that she had \"discovered Nefertiti\" in 2003 and evidently, outside of monetary gain, still hopes that she will be remembered as the one who found the mummy of the queen, even though chances of this happening are far slimmer than Joann Fletcher indicates in her book.

THE HUNTER, featuring the very delicious Hawk McMillan, does not disappoint (and it may be my new \"favorite\" by this author.)  Her characters have real depth here and she tackles some uncomforable real-life issues (such as human trafficking.)

For one thing, the author contradicts herself on more than one occasion when it comes to her supposed \"proof,\" and it is clear she had already made up her mind who the mummy was long before she ever even saw it.  As a fun read about how this woman got into her chosen career it's a good book, but otherwise rather lacking on both science and logic and has an obvious bias and agenda.

There had been a competition, Joann was told, in which her uncle and his army buds had participated.

In this way Dr, Fletcher really helps us to visualize the vast scale of the Pyramids.  She's no Ivy Compton Burnett when it comes to dialogue, but you do get the picture of a young woman who's deeply in love with archaelogy and with the romance of discovery.

         "In terms of my personal preferences, I have always been wary of true crime books that opt for a comprehensive or encyclopedic approach to any given subject. I avoided this book for a time for that reason. After finally reading it, I think my initial instincts were still on the money. There is much to like in this book, but, in attempting to summarize the Irish American criminal experience in America from the time of the Potato Famine to the present day, the author proved himself to be overly ambitious. Trying to tackle the criminal and political history of multiple cities (Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, New Orleans and New York), analyzing the Kennedy family political dynasty and its reputed ties to the underworld, plus examining the activities of Irish labor unions proved to be too much. There is enough information in \"Paddywhacked\" to form the basis of three or four separate books. Sometimes, less is more. Another problem is that the author repeats many historical errors found in other books. English makes numerous misstatements about various topics due to the questionable sources that he has chosen.  Relying upon a wildly inaccurate book such as Kenneth Anger's bitchy and entertaining \"Hollywood Babylon\" as a source for information about the Kennedys does not inspire too much confidence. That title has been properly dismissed as a supermarket tabloid. One unintentionally funny feature of the book is that the text was not edited by a thorough proofreader. The pages are filled with numerous spelling errors. Catholics do not worship at an \"alter\" nor do \"precinct captions\" organize people into \"voting blocks.\" A writer named English should familiarize himself with the English dictionary and language before seeking to recount the criminal activities of the Irish. Some of the historical interpretations are similarly suspect. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was quite comfortable with accepting the support of labor union thugs and machine politicians and was less of a reformer than the author suggests. It was not irregular or unusual for Judge Samuel Seabury, a genuine reformer, to continue to be addressed by his former judicial title after leaving the bench. It is an accepted custom within the legal community. One of the wildest assertions, however, is that the New Deal ushered in an era of reform that effectively ended political corruption and graft and sounded the death knell for the Irish engaged in machine politics. Mister English clearly is not familiar with the governing class that has been mismanaging Chicago, Illinois for the past eighty years or so. There are some terrific yarns in this book and you will not be disappointed if you do not expect too much. \"Paddy Whacked\" is entertaining, but not completely accurate historically.",

         "Few authors are as capable as Lehane.  Possessing stellar technical skills and a grand story-telling vision, he's put together something special with _Mystic River_. Dave, Jimmy and Sean are three Boston kids bound together by a single event: the abduction of Dave by sexual predators posing as cops.  Fast forward to the present; Dave is married and struggling with marginal employment; Jimmy is an ex-con trying to make it as a citizen with his ownership of a corner market; and Sean is a homicide detective. The three find their lives brought together and -- simultaneously -- torn asunder by the abduction and murder of Jimmy's oldest child Katie.  A beautiful, vivacious 19 year old, Katie has been shot and viciously beaten after her attacker chased her into a nearby park.  In the wake of the murder, none of the three former playmates will ever be the same. Lehane has beautiful writing ability, as evidenced by this single sentence describing a neighborhood party. \"Some of the guys who ran the card game in the back of the Pork Chop Brothers' store  brought out a folding table and a small grill, and pretty soon someone else carted  out some coolers filled with Schlitz and Narragansett, and the air turned fat with the smell of grilled hot dogs and Italian sausage, the wafting, smoky, charred smell and the whiff of open beer cans making Jimmy think of Fenway Park and summer Sundays and that tight joy you got in your chest when the adults kicked back and acted more like kids, everyone laughing, everyone looking younger and lighter and happy to be around each other.\" Aside from a couple of necessary contrivances that tighten up the story, there is little to criticize.

         "When it comes to organized crime in the U.S., the talk is generally \"Mafia this, Mafia that,\" and while La Cosa Nostra has certainly caused its share of mayhem, it's hardly fair to ignore the contribution other groups have made to the history of the American underworld.  Tons of minority groups, white and otherwise--Blacks, Chinese, Russians, Armenians, Jews, and so on--have been involved in organized criminal activities to one degree or another, but as T.J. English points out in Paddy Whacked, the Irish have one distiction that can never be taken away: they got there first.  English paints a vivid portrait of good old days that weren't always good, starting with the arrival of the first Irish immigrants after the potato famine of the 1840's and continuing through turbulent and violent times that saw the Irish emerge as a prominent force in the American criminal underworld as well as in American society as a whole.  Paddy Whacked tells some highly unpleasant stories about Irish-American history, shedding light on inhuman poverty, ethnic and religious prejudice, violent gang wars, and large-scale political malfeasance, but that doesn't stop it from being mighty entertaining throughout, no matter what your background.  If your view of the Irish is all shamrocks, leprechauns, and green beer on St. Patrick's day, this book should offer up some surprises, as much of what we associate with inner cities today (gangs, colors, drive-by shootings) had its roots at least partially in the Irish enclaves of the 19th and 20th centuries. Starting out in Ireland, English places the history of the Irish-American gangster squarely in the larger context of Irish and American history, tracing the Irish Mob's roots all the way back to the anticolonial societies that sprung up to fight British rule in the Old Country.  According to English, it was in these organizations that some of the most prominent features of the Irish gangster, and the Irish in general for that matter, were formed, from their intense togetherness to their emphasis on secrecy and mistrust of outsiders.  That said, though, the focus of Paddy Whacked is still squarely on its bizarre and diverse group of outlaw protagonists and what their experiences have to show us about the history of the Irish in the U.S., from the blinding poverty of famine-era immigrants (in New Orleans, landowners used the Irish to work the worst jobs on their plantations because THEY CONSIDERED THEIR SLAVES TOO VALUABLE) to their eventual emergence as what English calls \"generic white people\" in the last few decades.  The book describes in great detail how the Irish, starting out as a marginalized and ghettoized minority, managed to make themselves an institution in American life through constant struggle, even if many of them had to go way outside the law to get their piece of the pie.  Much like American pop culture's two best-known Mafia sagas--the Godfather movies and The Sopranos--Paddy Whacked presents the story of the Irish Mob as the embodiment of the shadier side of capitalism in the U.S.  Since the Irish were generally shut out of the mainstream of the American economy in their first few decades of the country, many of them had to turn to all sorts of vice--gambling, prostitution, loan-sharking, and later bootlegging and union scams--along with the creation of political machines in New York and other cities that brought with them massive amounts of corruption, in order to advance.  Interestingly, although English depicts the Prohibition era as an unprecedented boom time for the Irish gangster, he also shows that time as the beginning of his end, as the Irish found themselves increasingly marginalized by a more organized (and arguably more vicious) Italian-Jewish syndicate that steadily took over the organized crime business in most cities, with ridiculous amounts of bloodshed emerging from all the inter-ethnic conflicts that resulted. History lessons aside, the most entertaining aspect of Paddy Whacked is the way English manages to bring his subjects to life through in-depth personal profiles and detailed accounts of their criminal careers.  Starting with the first impoverished street gangs in New York, the Irish Mob encompassed all sorts of characters, from early vice lords and crooked political bosses to prohibition-era rumrunners and hitmen to postwar labor racketeers to the bloodthirsty killers who left swaths of destruction in Boston and New York well into the 1980's.  A lot of these guys emerge in English's telling as friendly enough types, many of them churchgoers who were generous and well-liked among their neighbors, but English doesn't soft-pedal the violence and ruthlessness that brought most of them to their positions in the first place, and he makes it clear that a few of them were just plain crazy or worse (Boston's own Whitey Bulger, especially, emerges pretty clearly as a sociopath, but if you read the previous Black Mass you already knew that).  However, many of the characters English sketches in this book--bootleggers like Owney Madden, Legs Diamond, and Spike O'Donnell, early Chicago vice lord King Mike McDonald, crazed gunman Mad Dog Coll, Kansas City machine boss Tom Pendergast, and disgraced ex-New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, to name a few--still managed to embody all the psychoses, contradictions, and struggles that have marked the long and checkered but largely successful history of the Irish in the U.S.  Ultimately, while English's book is concerned with the darker side of the Irish American experience, the history of the Irish Mob is still set against the backdrop of the eventual emergence of the Irish into mainstream society, even if there's still the occasional Whitey Bulger walking around to serve as a reminder that times weren't always good.",

Violence split three friends apart, and it is violence that reunites them over twenty years later. The violence is both physical and psychic. The violence and vengeance have unintended consequences. The characters are complex, enigmatic, ambiguous, perplexing and steeped in Catholic guilt. They come alive from page one with all their flaws, anguish, torment and personal demons. The whodunit is cleverly resolved, but \"Mystic River\" is much more than just a mystery story. Mr. Lehane takes you into the individual minds and souls of the players.

Back in 1976 I spent every Saturday at the local bookstore, and one day thought I would venture far from the Sci-Fi and Mystery shelves over to the BESTSELLERS! I would buy one, I thought, and take it home and expand my view. I saw this book, priced at the then unheard of price of $[...](you could get two paperbacks for that price back then), but I gulped and paid and sped home. Five minutes into reading I got that sickening feeling you get when you find out you've thrown your money away and you'll never get it back. Five minutes more only increased the sickness. I could stomach no more. I put it down. But I had a plan. I took it to Junior High the next day, and walking through the courtyard I took it from my backpack and spun it into the trash. I was immediately cleansed, and though I knew I would never get my money back I felt a rush of joy and lightness at having rid the world of such utter crap. Two good thing came of that event. Before, I treated and thought of books as sacred things. I did no longer. Books are not sacred. Good writing surely is. The second thing that happened is I never read another Vonnegut book. I put more effort into toilet paper than was put into that garbage. Having been treated so cavalierly by V-gut I determined not to be taken in again. No author deserves a second chance if the first contained so little effort. He spits in the face of the reader with this book with an attitude of: You'll read whatever I write because of who I am. Un-so. As a P.S., I opened a copy of B of Crap in the library some 20 years later to see if possibly I had been too immature in my Jr. High days and perhaps something of worth could be found within the pages. With pride at the profound insight of that young boy, I closed the book minutes later and put it back, assured that my first assessment had been correct. A piece of crap.

Out of the few Vonnegut books I've read, this is the funniest, and probably the best. Basically, Kurt here dismisses the entire American nation as racist, materialist, and obsessed with sex, class, alcohol, conformity, and whatever else you could trot out. It would be considered a pessimistic, nihilistic viewpoint if it wasn't a sadly accurate look at the way America worked, and still works today. And for a little note to those who think the book is racist, keep in mind that the black characters are actually portrayed as being, in a way, a lot more intelligent and less misanthropic than the white ones. This isn't an easy book to describe. There's a plot, but Kurt veers away from it on several occasions, offering a wide variety of satiric tangents that make for some of the most hilarious parts of his writing. There are illustrations, crude, simple, and absolutely hilarious. Kurt even sticks himself in the book, makes himself a character, and has discussions with other characters. Choice segments include the scene at the Holiday Inn cocktail lounge, where Kurt has a discussion with himself; every discussion of Kilgore Trout's misadventures with getting his books published by his sleazy publishing house; the uproarious prologue; every illustration; every tangent; and... well, pretty much everything. It's not a book for everyone, but if you're looking for a whole ton of laughs in one place, and some of the best satire known to mankind... whoa. This is it.

I chose Breakfast of Champions because I liked the title - I liked it even more when I learned that it was in reference to martinis. Vonnegut has a unique sense of humor and a style of writing that seems as candid as if he were writing it as a stream of consciousness or sitting in the same room with you telling the story. And it works, it works wondefully and I can't wait to read more of his works. Breakfast of Champions is about two men (a car salesman and a pulp fiction writer) who eventually cross paths in a cocktail lounge. The side characters aren't trivial - they each contribute in some way to each other and to the main characters. Vonnugut illustrates the book with simple and comical drawings that he did himself. While at times I wondered where in the story I was and what he was telling me about at the moment might (or might not) lead to, I stuck with it simply to keep enjoying his style and writing. The book seemed to be laughing at the planet and the people on it, breaking humans down into robots who are programmed to do this and that. Humans, in this novel, did not seem to enjoy the life they were living or take much pride in the world they lived in. The narrator (Vonnegut himself) often compares his characters penis size or the women's body measurements - otherwise nothing personal or individualistic about them. I looked up reviews and notes of the book after I finished reading hoping that they might offer something that I missed or a subplot that I didn't pick up on.

Winston Niles Rumfoord's smile and handshake dismantled Constant's high opinion of himself as efficiently as carnival roustabouts might dismantle a Ferris wheel.\" \"But Beatrice did have a face - and an interesting one. It could be said that she looked like a buck-toothed Indian brave. But anyone who said that would have to add quickly that she looked marvelous. Her face, like the face of Malachi Constant, was a one-of a kind, a surprising variation on a familiar theme - a variation that made observers think, 'Yes - that would be another very nice way for people to look.'\"",

I thought she wrote romantic comedy, but I didn't find it particularly funny, not like Jennifer Crusie can be. It is a romance, but it's also more, and it's heavier than what I'd expect romantic comedy to be. It's painful and then hopeful. When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I was going to like it. But I did. But I don't think I can read it cover to cover again. I just feel the pain of some of the characters too much. Unlike many other books I've read lately, I couldn't put this one down until I was over half way into it.

I read Vonnegut's \"Breakfast of Champions\" the first time when I was still a teen (in Polish translation) and this book was probably the most astonishing I ever read in my life. Funny (but also bitter), interesting, easy to read, even had some author pictures, sometimes strangely related to the text. But on the other hand, this book really make you think - about the world, about our civilization and where it is heading, about the people and their strange ways, about America. When I first read the book I was still in communistic Poland, so I saw some of the problems the author was talking about as a part of the western civilization. Now after I read it again, I see so much mild critique of excesses of America's life. I live in America ~ 10 years so it is normal that for me America would be always something different than my home country or Europe. I am amazed that Vonnegut still can look at America from the position of the external observer, who still can see some absurdity in many aspects of life. In spite of his critique of the world, country and society Vonnegut loves people, he loves them with all their weakness and defects. His books have great educational value.",

         "Two years after the Soviets launched Sputnik, nearly twenty years before Elton John recorded \"Rocket Man,\" and three decades before President Reagan unveiled SDI (his version of \"Star Wars,\") Kurt Vonnegut's 'Sirens of Titan' was published.  Not simply a satire of the \"Space Race,\" Vonnegut's first novel brings it all back home to earth all the vanity of vanities that spring from mankind in every civilization. The book focuses on the lives of two people:  Malachi Constant, a frivolous millionaire who puts much of his time and energy into space travel, and Winston Niles Rumfoord, an intellectual developer who entices Constant to go on a far-away journey at his own expense.  Rumfoord is the founder of a sect called The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent and the author of several staple near-future books, including 'The Pocket History of Mars'.  He is plotting a scheme to program all Martians (earthly human transplants) to make a futile attack on our home planet.  His intention is to make war so disastrous that man will abandon it on earth (not unlike Alfred Noble's inventing dynamite with the idea of making war so horrific, it would become obsolete).  Once Malachi is programmed as his alter ego, Unk, he awakens and tries to reunite his family and escape to earth... To go on with the development would be a spoiler, for the reader should curl up and read this piece of lit candy and revel in the story's unfolding.  The atmosphere is nearly perfect:  The novel is undoubtedly the most cartoonish of all of his books, yet the detailed development is realistic enough to transport us through space and time.  He makes the ridiculous plausible and the plausible ridiculous.  He has some of his most concise renderings of the folly of the human being and our history--as well as a good, solid-ground antidote to all of our foolishness.  Eventually, Malachi Constant does find out what's important in this life,...and, then, so do we.  How much is life determined by effort or by luck?  How much do God and man have a hand in human events?  Vonnegut may not give us all of the answers, but his observations are satisfying enough. (It's interesting to note, that having read 'Slaughterhouse Five,' arguably his best work, \"Trafalmadore,\" a distant planet in a distant galaxy is introduced here before his later classic.) (Reading Vonnegut brings to mind comparisons.  I think of Vonnegut as being influenced by the same pessimism as William Golding or Sartre.  Vonnegut seems as terse as Sartre, except fiercely funny.  Reading 'Sirens' also brings Ray Bradbury to mind.  Bradbury is grander, but Vonnegut makes tragedy into a farce.) (*\"Vanity of vanities...All life is vanity...\"  Ecclesiastes.)",

Dwayne Hoover is a successful car salesman, but also a man that is slipping into madness.  The second character is Vonnegut alter ego Kilgore Trout, the little-known sci-fi writer of interesting ideas and sloppy prose.  The last character is Vonnegut himself.  Vonnegut not only inserts his thoughts into the novel, but towards the end openly debates how to proceed with the story - providing a powerful end to the book.  Naturally, these pages also combine Vonnegut-style philosophy, thoughts about free will, and social critique of the USA circa 1973.

         "Mystic River is tough-guy crime fiction that also somehow manages to be lyrical and poignant. The characters are deep, thoughtful, emotional, almost too real in their complexity.  Each has his own hard set of problems or horrors to cope with.  There's a cop with a spousal relationship problem, an abused kid with a serious adjustment problem, an ex-mobster with some terrible secrets.  Their stories sometimes collide and sometimes run together, eventually converging into a deep and fascinating mystery.  The pace starts somewhat slowly, but the tension increases as the story unfolds, then refolds onto itself, then unfolds a little more.  I generally read more typical thrillers, so the slower pace of this book took a bit of adjustment.  But that pace enables Lehane to write with a degree of depth and detail that renders the tension greater, thicker and ultimately more troubling than the typical mystery.  Parts of this novel reminded me of the in-your-face, street-wise style of Chandler or Hammett; other parts evoked questions about morality and criminality more likely to arise in a college discussion of Dostoevsky.  Yet the story is seamless, fluid: like a polluted but powerful river that will run through your psyche well after you think you have finished this novel.",

         "I recently finished reading The Sirens of Titan, by Kurt Vonnegut.  What an amazing book!  It is definitely a unique and interesting read. The book is written as a science fiction story, but that hardly seems to matter.  As science fiction goes, it's a silly story.  Perhaps quaint or cute would best describe the science fiction.  But woven into this quirky little science fiction story is an endearing tale of one man's life as it is apparently determined completely out of his hands. As I read this easy little science fiction story, I was pleasantly surprised throughout the book, by moments of piercing satire or deep human emotion.  Like a glass of wine, the book has all these subtle flavors that sort of fade in and out through the story.  The writing is light and breezy, and the science fiction is quirky, but within that framework is an often dark and depressing tale, and a biting satire, and within that is an incredibly tender story, and all kinds of room to ponder the meaning of life.  It is a very satisfying read as all these things are mixed so well. On the copy I have the front cover has a quote from Esquire which states, \"He [Vonnegut] dares not only to ask the ultimate question about the meaning of life, but to answer it.\" Well, I don't know about that.  I certainly don't think Vonnegut gives the meaning of life in his book.  Like anyone else, he doesn't know, and I think he makes that pretty clear.  But he does provide a lot to reflect on, and I think what he does is give a bit of perspective to our lives.  For example, one of my favorite little gems for putting things into perspective was this conversation near the end of the book between Malachi Constant and Salo: \"You finally fell in love, I see,\" said Salo. \"Only an Earthling year ago,\" said Constant.  \"It took us that long to realize that a purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved.\" Other questions regarding the existence of god or of man's control over his life could debated for hours without conclusion.  Vonnegut's book provides much food for thought in this, but no definite answers.  How could it be otherwise?  No matter what your own personal conclusions, the Sirens of Titan is sure to inspire additional insight.  The book is a delight to read, and will leave you pondering it long after you've finished reading it.",

I didn't know what to expect, I didn't have any preconseptions about the author. I started the book a few days ago and I just couldn't put it down! I understand that Lehane is a crime/mystery novelist, but Mysitic River is much more than that. This is a mystery novel that has a soul. It has an emotional denisity that we rarely find in novels of this genre. It grabs you by the gut from the very first page and only lets go of you on the final page. In Mystic River, you have three childhood friends who are reunited by the gruesome murder of a young woman. Something horrible happened to one of them when they were younger, and the shadows of that event still haunt them. As the murder investigation, progresses, the three friends become entertwined, but not always in the ways you'd expect. One of them becomes the prime suspect, the other is the father of the deceased and the last is the cop who is doing the investigation. Rarely have I seen characters so fully fleshed out and realistic. It's like you've known these people all your life. They breathe, think and act like we would. Their dialogue is sharp and realistic and - and this is probably the book's best asset - simplistic. Rarely do I read a book where EVERY single character feels real and three-dimensional. This is one book you won't be able to put down. You'll want to read it from cover to cover in one sitting. Lehane created a wonderful work of fiction which is dramatic, suspenseful and mysterious all at once. Mystic River will end up on many best of year-end list for 2001, so don't miss out on this wonderful, amazing book!",

While MYSTIC RIVER remains noirish like his previous books, this stand-alone novel marks a gigantic leap forward for Lehane's writing career.  This book is the complex and densely-plotted story of three men who knew one another as boys. As a youth, Dave Boyle got into a car while his friends didn't.  Upon his return, he was different and that difference destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine and Jimmy Marcus.  As adults, Sean's a policeman, Jimmy's an ex-con, and Dave's struggling through life.  Their lives are disrupted by the murder of Jimmy's daughter.  Following the homicide, each man must confront a past he is not eager to face. Lehane works his story masterfully, showing once again why he is considered a true master of contemporary noir.

         "Dennis Lehane wisely elected to take a break from his Kenzie-Gennaro mystery series, and gambled on a new and different venture, a more broadly drawn novel of crime, consequence, and human frailty and folly.  The results are staggeringly successful, as *Mystic River* is nothing short of a masterpiece within the crime novel genre. In terms of the mystery story line, I suppose some readers can rightfully find fault with the book, including its ending.  It is neither the most intricate nor the most surprise-filled tale of its type.  What's amazing about *Mystic River*, however, is that in some ways the \"mystery story\" actually is less riveting and significant than is the overall collage of characters, times, and places.  This is not just a \"mystery novel\" but a \"novel,\" period, one that engages the reader from page one and never lets go until the last line on page four hundred. Lehane has a knack for capturing in a few well-chosen words and phrases what people are feeling and thinking, what makes them tick, what drives them for good or (in his stories, mostly) for evil.  The man can flat-out write, and with each new novel his skills move to yet another level. The one \"yeah, but\" that emerged for me as I read *Mystic River* was of the political/philosophical type.  Clearly, the world as portrayed by Dennis Lehane is a twisted, dark, and unhappy place.  With the exception of his troubled-but-doing-the-right-thing protagonists, the characters that animate his vision of human existence tend toward the haunted and desperate, and the overall mood and message of *noir* sticks with you long after you've finished his books.  Are people really as tragically scarred and warped as Lehane tells us?  Are we to take this dark vision of human life to heart and allow it to shape (and limit) our philosophies, actions, and notions of what is possible for our lives and the lives of those around us?  I like to think that this cynical world-view is *meant* to be partial, that it leads us into a dark and frightening but unabashedly *fictional* world that is not intended to be a literal mirror of the real world--in other words, it's art, but it's also show biz, and we as readers should not mistake its message, however spellbinding, for any overly serious declaration about the totality of the \"human condition.\"  When we enter Lehane's universe, we are invited, even forced to suspend to some degree our critical everyday notions about human nature, social progress, and the human capacity for noble as well as terrible deeds.  It's like looking at the world as the distorted reflection of a carnival side-show mirror--what we see is indeed a reflection of things that are real, but the image is hardly meant to be accurate and photographic. On the other hand, however, once a reader has considered human existence as it is portrayed by a wordmaster like Lehane, it's hard not to allow his insights and visions to affect daily thoughts about \"life\" and \"people.\"  His writing is immensely powerful, and it stays with you long after you've moved on to other authors, books, and literary genres.",

         "I am absolutely mystified as to how something as poorly written and researched as this could ever be considered by an agent and/or publisher. I borrowed the book and, as another reviewer mentioned, could not finish it, although I skimmed the last chapters. My motivation was more curiosity than actual interest. First, the language is absurd, both in regards to dialogue and narrative. The modern idioms are jarring, and the obscenties are both inappropriate to the character, and anachronistic. At times Anne Boleyn is shrewish and flat, at others, maudlin and melodramatic. The \"f-word\" was definitely in use by Anglo-Saxon times, but simply meant sowing fields with seed; the notion of Anne Boleyn dropping the modern idiom \"f-bomb\" is simply absurd. I suspect her often employed insults were edgy, even brutal, but not cellar rat obscene. To reduce her wit to something akin to the scatological rumblings of a teenage boy is the mark of a hack writer. As a historian specializing in this period (medieval and early Renaissance England), I have never encountered a good piece of fiction concerning this tragic and complex queen. None have captured a period feel (in language, setting, attitudes or thought processes), nor been historically accurate. I simply do not understand why facts must be distorted,  embellished, ignored, or created, as Anne Boleyn lived an extraordinary life in an extraordinary time. This is just another tedious exercise in distorted reality, similar to that execrable \"The Other Boleyn Girl\".",

Lehane gave a great sense of the neighborhoods and streets that I've spent my entire life in and on.  Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, the two protagonists, are flawed, human characters with enough real life foibles to provide enough conflict to propell the series forward.  And in their psycho friend, Bubba, Lehane provides the killing machine that every successful detective series requires.  (You know; Hawk, Joe Pike, Easy Rawlins cousin, Mouse, etc.) My main exception to the story was the depiction of gang war in Boston that made the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan' look tame.  I thought that Lehane went way overboard with the body count.  It just didn't seem realistic.  But, as you can see by my heading, I felt that there was enough here to make me look forward to the subsequent sequels.

         4,
         "Breakfast of Champions is one of Vonnegut's more light-hearted pieces.  However, the book does have serious comments on society, life, and the interaction of people.  The story follows two characters:  Mr. Trout, a science fiction writer; and a car salesman by the name of Mr. Hoover. Kilgore Trout has been summoned by Elliot Rosewater (who is also the main character in Kurt Vonnegut's \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\") to be the guest of honor at an arts festival.  Quite suprised that anyone even knows he exists, Mr. trout sets off across the country to attend the event.  Along the way, Vonnegut treats the reader to a variety of Trout's short story ideas (most of which sound like either bad, or really obscure science fiction).  At the same time, the story follows Wayne Hoover's dysfunctional sturggle to make it through life as an automobile salesman.  The story focuses both men as they progress towards, and eventually converge on the arts festival.  Many characters that appear in this novel also appear in other Vonnegut novels, making it an excellent introduction to Kurt Vonnegut's work.   Among the many minor (or mini) themes that Vonnegut offers the reader throughout the book, a major one emerges.  He seems to say that people should be careful of what they say, or write, because we effect other is ways that we can't even imagine (both negativelly and possitivelly).  Often times we are, and remain, unaware of the consequences of our actions.   There is also another aspect of the novel that is noteworthy:  The illustrations.  Mr. Vonnegut weaves rather simple drawing into the actual text of the story (often for a humorous effect).  These illustrations often take the place of verbal descriptions.  For the first hundred pages, or so, this style is interesting.  However, after that it grows old, and begins to seem like an easy way to avoid describing objects.  This, however, is my only complaint concerning the book.  I would recomend the novel to any Kurt Vonnegut fan.  I would also recomend this as an introduction to Mr. Vonnegut's work, or to a person who loves humorous stories.",

You'll like Fire Your Boss if you buy into the authors' value system  Pollan and Levine don't mince words.  Work, they say, is about money. Given a choice of two job offers, choose whichever gives you the most money, time or both. Don't expect satisfaction and fulfillment from work. For many people, this advice will make sense. However, some people work in truly toxic environments and they'll become ill -- mentally and/or physically -- if they stay. Some companies (such as SAS in North Carolina) offer quality of life that makes sense for many employees. And some people manage to have truly wonderful jobs. Once on the job, say the authors, success comes from pleasing your boss. Never mind the company: it's all about keeping your boss on your side because she's the only person who can help you.  In general, this advice is excellent; however, company culture can influence your boss's power, your ability to transfer within the firm and/or your ability to avoid being fired. I stay away from absolutes -- so \"Nobody hires a stranger\" should be translated, \"People like to hire their friends.\" The best section of the book covers networking: these days, you make friends, not contacts. So your long-term strategy will involve joining groups and socializing with people who can help you. And, as with all career books, you have to do some reality checks. When you get a competing offer from an outside firm, say the authors, pay attention to a counter-offer from your own firm.  However, some experts say that sixty to eighty percent of employees who accept those counteroffers are gone in six months. If you do accept a counteroffer, get a contract or the type of termination agreement these authors recommend. The very best advice from these authors: Always keep \"fishing,\" as they say. Never stop watching the job market. Prepare to move for the right conditions. I don't agree with their checklists of \"factors\" -- I've developed my own decision processes -- and I think you have to be careful before jumping ship too fast. Some people are hired to be scapegoats, some bosses have hidden agendas, and some employees do get stranded in tiny towns in the middle of nowhere. I suspect the authors fill in the blanks when they're coaching one-to-one and/or they choose their clients very, very carefully.  And I definitely recommend this book as a perspective that, while incomplete, offers a helpful corrective to the airy promises of \"Dream and do it.\" For career change, I'd supplement with Herminia Ibarra's Working Identity and Martha Beck's Finding Your Own North Star.",

The story here is really secondary to the social criticism that Vonnegut doles out. Here we get his views on many things (America, slavery, racism, pollution, sex, God) all woven into the story in a clever and entertaining way. Vonnegut has an odd way of keeping you reading, he's not a master of suspense per se, but his books are always hard to put down. For one thing, his prose is always clear and lucid, and the writing is extremely fast-paced, also he drops here and there hints of what is to come in the novel without actually spelling out the details. One would think this would make it pointless and useless to finish the book, but it has, in fact, the opposite effect.

One of the things that most interest me about his novels is not the answer he gives; yet the questions he dares his readers to ask themselves.  And there in lies the meaning of life.

Antagonistically, the two are forced to work together to solve the disappearance of a mutual friend which only leads further into the depths of a dark mystery. Disappointingly, a contemporary weight is felt throughout the story.  And although Anne Mallory tries to convey a heated attraction between the main characters, the warmth is just not felt!  Regrettably, this romance is too reserved and too congested!  Grade: C Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada.",

As anyone schooled in Astrology knows, the Rising Sign is very significant, as well as the Moon Sign, in shaping our personalities and relationships with others. I do not recommend this book at all because it takes itself too seriously--by creating such overly specific traits per sign (e.g. Aquarian men often talk fervently and look to their side like they're on camera and addressing it...) GIVE ME A BREAK! That is WAY too... specific, which is essentially too far-fetched to assume the majority of people born under this sign would fit that trait. The book is also just full of biased, even prejudice assumptions: All Cancer gay men are essentially WOMEN, who cannot be anything but the feminine partner, in a gay union?

         "Hank Malone was the town bad boy.  He's returned to take up his inheritance - an apple orchard in Vermont.  He has plans to turn it into a serious organic business, but in the town's eyes, he's still the same troublemaking stud he used to be, and the bank won't take him seriously for a loan.  To change his image, he decides to hire a wife for six months, to give the illusion of stability and hopefull get the business loan.  He hires Maggie Toone in New Jersey and brings her to his farm.  She's eager to escape her small town life and job as a teacher, and relishes the chance to fulfill her dream of writing a book based upon her aunt's diaries.  One small problem - her aunt was the local madam. This is a very funny and witty book.  Hank and Maggie's relationship is romantic and sexy.  The dialogue is classic Evanovich - she easily writes in the rhythm of natural speech so the reader feels as though he/she could step right into the conversation.  Hank falls in love with Maggie right off the bat and plots to make their marriage a real one; she is not so sure that she wants to be stuck in another small town.  Elsie Hawkins, a reoccuring character in Ms. Evanovich's romances, is present here as a temporary housekeeper.  She is the prototype of the Grandma Mazur character of the Stephanie Plum series - a feisty, blunt-speaking senior who drives a '57 Cadillac, packs a gun, and is in serious pursuit of the male species (in her age group, they tend to drop dead unexpectedly so she tries to act quickly). Hopefully, someday these early Evanovich books will be reissued, but until then, this definitely one used-book worth finding.",

Far from fun, much of what I saw in the book is biased and negative; sign studies felt heavily male and gay oriented, downplaying and shunting women into the background a bit. An added warning: it's also written in what appears to be UK English, dappled in pretentious obscure literati turns of phrase (including haughty doses of unnecessary French terminology that evade US English Kindle dictionary look-ups altogether) which makes it an uncomfortable read for most Americans.

As I read Aries to my husband he sat there with his mouth open saying they don't know me and he had this quirky little smile on his face, admitting they had nailed him exactly. It is amazing how they delivered with precision the details of each sign. I have read and studied astrology for many years and never found another book as informative and accurate as this one. The signs in the book address the positives and negatives and what was truly amazing was the information on the complexity of the earth signs [Taurus, Virgo and Capricorns] and Pisces. These signs are the most confounding and confusing of the zodiac, however upon reading their descriptive explanations as to why these signs are designed as they are, revelations of information flood you with knowledge about how to cope with them and understand how to push their on and off buttons and how to avoid conflicts. Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Aquarious and Sagittarius are amazing reads and their personalities are quite different, unique and easily understandable. Cancer and Scorpio are without much fanfare and deeply dedicated to family. If you want to learn about the intricate details and workings of each sign as well as the parental connections each likely had and how family relates together, this is the book to read.

         "I'm sometimes commitment phobic --- not at all in a relationship sense (my husband's saying, \"Uh, that's GOOD!\") but when it comes to reading. Occasionally, I just don't feel like investing the energy in a novel. No, I'd rather dally. A short story collection is the perfect solution at these times, much like sampling dim sum rather than sitting down to a seven-course feast. I've been on a short story binge lately, and it's been so delicious that my love affair with short fiction has been rekindled.  A MOMENT ON THE EDGE is a massive (over 500 pages) compilation of luscious tidbits. The editor, much-loved mystery novelist Elizabeth George, starts us out with a fascinating introduction discussing our simultaneous fascination with crime stories and the low value many people place on it. She briefly sums up the history of female mystery writers. About the authors of this anthology, George says: \"All of them share in common a desire to explore mankind in a moment on the edge. The edge equates to the crime committed. How the characters deal with the edge is the story.\"  The collection begins with \"A Jury of Her Peers\" by Susan Glaspell (1917) and ends with \"English Autumn--American Fall\" by Minette Walters (2001). The variety of crime stories is immense, including cozies, murder mysteries, suspense tales, horror stories, psychological studies, and more. Reading the older tales and then moving on to the more modern works is a subtle education in how crime stories have changed over the years.  Some of the authors' contributions are completely unlike their novels (for example, Nancy Pickard's dark \"Afraid All the Time.\") In other cases, characters from an author's novels appear in her short story (such as Sara Paretsky's \"The Case of the Pietro Andromache.\") I joyfully became reacquainted with authors I've loved (and nearly forgotten) for years, such as Charlotte Armstrong and Shirley Jackson. I also discovered many writers whose novels I will now find and devour, having sampled their wares.  I must admit to sometimes skimming and/or skipping stories in an anthology if they don't catch my interest. However, I was never tempted to skim or skip a word in this fine collection. In such a group of stellar tales, I discovered a few personal standouts:   A ghost appears in Agnes and Oscar's RV as they winter in Arizona (\"Death of a Snowbird\" by J. A. Jance), setting the plot spinning and giving me goose bumps.   A picnicking couple discusses their relationship in \"The River Mouth\" by Lia Matera. They're approached by someone who puts the STRANGE in the word \"stranger\" --- and completely creeped me out.   Joyce Carol Oates's \"Murder-Two\" is gut-churningly disturbing. My first inclination is to say I hated this piece about a murdered mother, yet I'll never forget the plot or my strong reaction to it.   \"Afraid All the Time\" by Nancy Pickard, in which a woman's move to the plains sends her over the edge into depression and fear, impressed me with its darkness and unpredictable twists.   One man suggests to another that he has the means to murder anyone in Dorothy Sayers's \"The Man Who Knew How,\" a fine exercise in obsession, psychological suspense and blackest irony  .  A dirt-poor woman discovers how to step up to finer living in \"A Nice Place to Stay\" by Nedra Tyre, a story with sociological implications that ring true today.  A MOMENT ON THE EDGE is an absolute delight. Don't wait for commitment phobia to strike before treating yourself to this excellent collection.  --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon",

This book while it left some unanswered questions, and brought up others also left me with the feeling that I want another story from Peters. The author does a great job with character developement and though I felt that Nefret and Ramses where a little on the whinning side of things where still interesting to read. I would have like more of a romance thing with Amelia and Emerson- after all really she is the main or should be the main character in these books. That seems to be the only thing I would like to see more off in this book and the series in general is more Amelia and less of Nefret and Ramses - give them there own series if you must but please leave Amelia. I did like this book because it seemed to visualize more of the Egypt that I like - mysterious and interesting. But this book had passages and places that I wonder if I would have found more interesting if I had read the one where they got Nefret (that is one of the three I've yet to read).

         "I picked up this book because of the fun and cute cover that grabbed my eye and then when I read the plot, it made me chuckle: a spitfire heroine who abducts the hero and ties him up to force him to marry her! That's quite an unusual way for a romance novel! Usually it is always the heroine who is forced to marry, so it was interesting to see that Karen Hawkins took an unique spin on this storyline and I was intrigued to see how she would pull it off. But what a disappointment this book was! It wasn't funny nor cute (which the very nice cover and the jacket blurb led me believe it would be), the story was shallow and Karen Hawkins didn't make any effort to make her characters 3D and interesting, she kept them one dimensional and simple, the \"twists and turns\" in the storyline were forced and not even surprising, I seriously regret spending those few hours I spent reading this. I tried to warm to the heroes and though there were a few characteristics that made me like them and root for them, I think it's the author's fault that she didn't give us enough to fall in love with them. The romance part was kept basic and simple too: one moment the hero and the heroine realise they are in love with each other, but you can't see what or how they came to love each other. There is no character transformation, yes it is stated that just with a snap of fingers Jack the gambling and unfaithful playboy wants to forsake London and his previous lifestyle and \"bury himself\" in the Scottish countryside and become an exemplary husband and family man. Which wouldn't be so unbelievable, I have seen such transformation completely credible in other stories, but here the author just states he was a new man, but doesn't show how and why he came to be so different. This book lacks humour, wit, romance, character and storyline depth, so everything that makes a story a good one. If you'd like to read a good, funny and cute Scottish romance I'd rather suggest you read some Julie Garwood (The Secret, The Wedding..) than waste your time and money with this.",

When he fell \"backward to the future,\" the dinosaurs \"delivered me to tomorrow in ways I could not imagine.\"  The memory of walking backward through Chicago's multimillion-year remembrance enabled him to write the screenplay for 'Moby Dick.\"  From there, he was commissioned to develop a building at the New York World's Fair in 1964, with a ride through America's history.  He was asked, \"Can you create a four-hundred-year history of America in seventeen minutes flat, with a full symphony orchestra?\"  He was delivered \"to the topmost interior of the United States Pavilion, where, gliding on a circular track as big as a football field, he wept in disbelief that by long ago stepping in reverse, he had fallen into Now.\" That led into the grand Disney offer to develop the Epcot Center.  Walt's Imagineers had a 50 million-dollar building to transform into the world of tomorrow.  \"Can you write a two-thousand-year communication history in twelve minutes flat with a full symphony orchestra?\"  He'd made a journey from cave to Ben Franklin's lightning shocks, to Apollo's Moon and beyond.  He dedicates this volume \"with love to my friends, Loren Eiseley and Aldous Huxley, whose essays showed me the way.\"",

         "Bradbury Speaks isn't bad...but it's also not that good. Ray Bradbury HAS lived one heck of a life, and in this life, Bradbury has moved through the ages among some of the most interesting and famous people of our time. All the while, he has remained a forward-thinking optimist and a lover of both middle America and the one-time dream city of the 20th century, Los Angeles, where he's lived sans a car for some fifty years. The Bradbury his three-dozen essays introduce is variously Ray Bradbury the cantankerous old coot, Bradbury the surprisingly lusty young buck, Bradbury the opinionated idealist and Bradbury the name-dropper. What was missing from this collection was Bradbury, master of the written word. There just wasn't much to pin down my attention here. I wanted him to talk more about his books and I wanted him to share what made him tick. In short, I wanted to get to know Ray Bradbury better.  I thought I'd enjoy this trail back through Bradbury's nine decades, but in his true tales he failed to reach out with the kind of offerings that have made his fiction the stuff of modern legend. Here we can learn about certain events that inspired a few of his books, and we can be a party to his state of mind at various times. We can find out that Bradbury admires Walt Disney's appreciation of joy, and that Bradbury regards Disneyland as the epitome of that lovely inner-happiness expressed before all the world, but for every truly worthy anecdote, we must read thru half a dozen other lesser drags on the reader's time. This book doesn't take anything away from Bradbury's career achievements but it doesn't do a lot toward adding to them, either. I wanted Bradbury's views and stories from his life that...well...that interested me instead of merely being \"okay\". And OK is all Bradbury Speaks is.",

         "Biskupic picks up where Justice O'Connor left off in her joint biography (with brother Alan) of growing up on the Lazy B ranch in southern Arizona, and includes O'Connor's decision to pursue law studies at Stanford (\"to make a difference,\" and as an outgrowth of a professor contending that an individual had a responsibility to the community). After graduating from Stanford, marrying, and living in Germany with her husband while he competed his military assignment, Sandra Day O'Connor eventually settled in Phoenix.  Failing to find employmente commensurate with her education, she started a law firm with another attorney, had three sons (took off five years to raise them), joined many community boards, helped/led several major Republican political campaings, became an assistant State's Attorney General, was appointed to a legislative vacancy (and subsequently elected in her own right), and became President of the State Senate. Upon William Rehnquist's nomination to the Supreme Court, Sandra O'Connor undertook considerable effort to support him, including contacting fellow Stanford classmates, U.S. Senators, and newspaper editors, as well as making supporting speeches.  Afterwards she left the State Senate to run for a vacant county judge position (won). Several years later O'Connor was appointed by Governor Babbitt (Dem) to the state Appeals Court, and then had the opportunity to spend some time vacationing with Chief Justice Burger. O'Connor's having grown up on a Western ranch seemed to make her more attractive to President Reagan, who had made a campaign promise to appoint a woman to the Court.  Her prior abortion stance (voted to end an Arizona law prohibiting it) threatened to torpedo her nomination, but supporters (including Senator Goldwater) managed to quickly move the process forward and overcome opposition. The remainder of the book details O'Connor's actions in a number of Court cases.  (It was somewhat comforting to read of how sharply she honed in on issues while on the Court - I had a brief experience before her in her County Court, and was amazed and even intimidated by her sharp questioning even then.) Finally, while I have the highest regard for Justice O'Connor, it was disappointing to read of the large role played by politics - even in our judicial system, and especially the centrality of the abortion issue.  I was also unhappy to read about O'Connor's political comments (wanting to retire while a Republican was President), her dancing around the abortion issue, and key role in the 2000 election.",

         "Andy Kessler writes a nice book.  I mean he's a professional writer and he spent a lot of time on Wall Street before and during the bubble years, up close and personal.  And he wasn't a stock broker and he wasn't a trader.  He was an analyst in technology stocks during a time when technology stocks mushroomed up like tulips under the windmills.  A stock analyst studies the industry and the individual companies.  He knows revenues and profits and cash flow and debts and bottom lines.  He's a fundamentalist.  He makes recommendations.  Buy, hold, sell--well, they never actually recommended \"sell\" in those days.  Presumably he knows when the price of a stock is out of step with what it's worth. But the bubble years were tough times for fundamentalists since the ducks were quacking and when the ducks quack they say, \"We don't need no stinkin' fundamentals.  We just buy the dips.\" At some point Kessler discovered that there's something wrong with this picture.  If a stock analyst knows so much why is he working for Goldman Sacks or Morgan Stanley?  If he knows which stocks are going to go up and which are going to go down, why hasn't he mortgaged the ranch and milked all his relatives for funds and invested in the stocks himself? Here's the answer.  Hold on to your sweet petunias.  As Kessler notes in the very first chapter he's only supposed to get it right 51% of the time, and with a little hedging and ex-post facto double-talk, he can fudge that.  In other words, it's crystal ball time, and rational people don't raid the cookie jar to bet on flips of the coin. Let me tell you what an \"analyst\" is called  in Las Vegas.  An analyst is a \"tout.\"  That's a \"Gold Sheet\" or a \"Green Sheet\" sold in liquor stores and bars with a phone number and some stars and exclamation points advertising their monster \"**Superlock of the Week!!!**\"  That is, you pay them some money and they tell you which sports team to bet on.  Needless to say, if they really knew who was going to cover the spread that week, they would mortgage the ranch...etc. By the way, one of the problems with Andy's strict fundamentalist approach is that the markets are not entirely rational, which is why there is such a thing as technical analysis, which basically says the trend is your friend, or forget the fundamentals, buy the chart--or more deeply understood, buy the irrational exuberance of the public, which is what most of the people who made money in the go-go nineties did.  A nice little book that explains some of this is Joel Kurtzman's How the Markets Really Work (2002) where he gives his conviction that, \"Markets may move to the beat of their dumbest members,\" adding, \"In my view...markets are not rational.\" Anyway, at some point (it is clear to me) Andy Kessler realized that although he wasn't the kind of analyst that touts only those stocks that his firm owns or does business with, he was still a Wall Street strawberry.  We can tell he figured this out because somewhere about three-quarters of the way into this very readable and engaging tome, he ups and leaves the comfy confines of Morgan Stanley and a six-figure plus income and begins to do his own investing.  That is, he actually bets on his own picks.  Wow.  Now understand that even here of course he hedges.  He forms his own capital management company; that is to say, he gets people to send him money which become chips that he shoves into the pot on their behalf.  If he wins, hurrah, and if the stocks he likes tank, well, he still gets paid. Kessler's is the latest in a long line of \"confessional\" books written by Wall Street people, almost always ex-Wall Street people--e.g., Where Are the Customers' Yachts? (1940) by Fred Schwed Jr.; License to Steal: the Secret World of Wall Street and the Systematic Plundering of the American Investor (1999) by Anonymous and Timothy Harper...etc.  Kessler's book stands out because he was an analyst, not a salesman (i.e., a \"broker\"), and because he worked with and knew many of the top people on the street and was well-regarded, but was not a top executive.  This is also an interesting personal story of a somewhat geek tech guy (but personable) who was smart enough and eventually hip enough to wow 'em in the presentations, who worked hard enough to be (I'm guessing) right more than half the time. Where his book is not among the best is in what he leaves out.  For some reason Kessler doesn't actually reveal how much he was paid (again I guessed at the six figures plus) or how well the stocks he touted performed, nor is he specific about how well he did with his own portfolio.  We realize when he gets to trading and discovers the market-maker's spread (Where did THAT come from?) that he really had little idea what life was like for the \"retail people\" who had to not only buck the spread but, before the rise of Internet trading, pay rather hefty commissions as well--which is why the customers never had any yachts.  But Kessler's reticence is probably just as well since everybody knows that there are two things people consistently lie about: sex and money.  Kessler doesn't mention the former and is vague about the latter.  I tend to respect that. Bottom line: unless you are Jack Grubman, Frank Quattrone, Henry Blodget and some of the other pieces of Wall Street Meat that Kessler writes about who went down with the ship, you will find this an amusing book, a nice diversion from a long, long time ago on which to reflect.  Kessler knows all the buzz words; he knows the players and (somewhat inadvertently) he lets us know him.",

         "This is an excellent book to lift the curtain and see what really goes on working as an analyst on the street.  This book is short, 200 pages,in big print, and makes a point of not taking itself too seriously as it describes a humorous, hard-working and deceptive Wall Street. Kessler was an engineer plucked from obscurity to become a stock analyst.  With simple but great advice from his boss, Kessler flies by the seat of his pants learning the business from 1985 to the mid 90s.  But what makes this book perfect is while he describes life on Wall Street and the many conflicts of interest as he learns the business, his Wall Street years were spent working along side many famous analyst who moved the market in the late 90s to the biggest stock market rally in history.  Jack Grubman is the most prominent and is described as a good friend, fun-loving guy of incredible talent who later in life controlled the telecom market possibly with questionable tactics.  Later he works with Frank Quattrone, known as the banker for the Internet.  As an analyst, Quattrone and Kessler were many times on opposite sides of client debates.  Kessler humorously describes their battles and debates while giving credit to Frank's unique talents and giving hints of how he might have helped in his downfall.  Mary Meeker and Henry Blodgett are also mentioned from a perspective few investors would see from just reading about them in magazines or newspapers. I can't over-emphasize how much fun this book is.  Many times authors try to tell you everything they know.  Kessler, possibly from experience writing concise research reports, does a great job of saying a lot without using many words wasting your time.  While this book will be good for anyone wanting to learn of the conflicts reseach analysts must face, it is a must read for novice or hobby stockpickers.  If nothing else but to show you the system you are working against.  I strongly recommend this book for all readers with interest in finance or the stock market.",

         "The subtitle of this book, \"The Home Run That Changed America,\" may seem a bit lofty to those born too soon to remember this record-breaking blow. But in these pages, Tom Stanton does a fine job of interweaving the story of Henry Aaron's chase of baseball's most hallowed record with the tale of the impact of that pursuit on the larger society. Stanton's love for the game shines through in this narrative, as does his sense of shame for those elements of the public who greeted Aaron's achievement not with praise, but scorn and hatred. The narrative begins in the fall of 1972 with Aaron among those  in attendance at the funeral of Jackie Robinson, the man who broke the color barrier in modern baseball. The bulk of the book tells the story of the 1973 season, which saw Aaron surpass Willie Mays for second place on the career home run list and finally fall one short of Ruth's magic total of 714. Over the course of that season Aaron had to endure the ravages of age (he was thirty-nine), a steadily intensifying media circus, and most disheartening of all, a vocal stream of hatred and abuse, most (if not all) of it racially motivated. The retrospective distance of three decades makes it clear that if anyone was prepared to endure this great strain, it was Henry Aaron. While other players in bigger media markets like Mays and Mickey Mantle had captured the public's imagination with flashier performances, Aaron had been toiling away in Milwaukee and Atlanta, steadily building up career totals that would place him in the first rank of baseball's Hall of Fame...and humanity's as well. Aaron came back for the 1974 season determined to put the quest for the record behind him as quickly as possible. This couldn't come without controversy, either. Atlanta officials found themselves embroiled in conflict with then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn when they threatened to hold Aaron out of the opening three games at Cincinnati so he could achieve the record at home. Under pressure from Kuhn, the Braves played Aaron in Cincinnati, where he tied the record. Fittingly, though, he saved the blast that put him alone in the baseball universe for the home fans. Appropriately, this is where Stanton's narrative ends. There's a brief afterword on what's happened to Aaron and the other key players (including a young acolyte of Aaron's, Dusty Baker) in the decades since. But the heart of the story is in that year and a half recounted in these pages....when, as Stanton puts it, Aaron placed an exclamation mark on Jackie Robinson's great achievement and helped further erode the barriers standing in the way of full equality for all Americans.--William C.

         "Fun, Informative History",
         4,
         "In \"America's Prophet: Moses and the American Story,\" Bruce Feiler chronicles the sometimes surprising influence of Moses within American history.  \"Prophet\" strikes me as a fun, trivia-filled jaunt through American history with a little more depth than the History Channel but less than an academic textbook.  The Exodus motifs, he argues, of deliverance from oppression toward a \"there on the horizon\" Promised Land emerge again and again at key moments in the story of the United States. Feiler, a gifted wordsmith, carries us from the landing of Puritan pilgrims at Plymouth, Massachusetts through the American Revolution, the American Civil War, the immigration boom of the early 20th century to the Civil Rights movement.  Some parts of the story bog down in historical minutae but Feiler generally balances detail with scope, an important balance in a work of pop-level history.  Yet some of those details are quite memorable.  I had no idea that the largely Deist Founding Fathers - John Adams, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson - proposed the drowning of the Egyptian army during the Israelite exodus as the Great Seal of the United States.  The rich use of Exodus imagery used by slaves in the 18th century was no surprise, but the exploration of Mosaic themes during the boom of immigration to the U.S. in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was new territory.  I appreciated the connections Feiler made between the biblical concern for outsiders and strangers (everywhere evident in the Torah, the first five books of the Bible ascribed to Moses) and the assimilation of immigrants into America, symbolized in the erection of the Statue of Liberty.  Feiler doesn't often preach in \"Prophet,\" but at points such as this he can't resist: \"A society must gauge its worth not by power, the statue insists, but on how it treats its strangers\" (192). Though this is an entertaining and informative book in the cast of Stephen Prothero's \"American Jesus,\" I kept asking myself that all important question: so what?  As a preacher, I must wrestle with that question every week I sink myself into a biblical text.  It's incredibly difficult for me to resist that question when reading someone else tackling a biblical figure, even if his aim is somewhat different than my own. In the final chapter, Feiler steps into the pulpit, if only briefly.  He argues, \"You can't understand American history, I now believe, without understanding Moses.  He is a looking glass into our own soul\" (298).  He names three themes as to why this is.  First, Moses inspires \"the courage to escape oppression and seek the Promised Land\" (298).  Second, Moses' story exemplifies \"the tension between freedom and law\" (299).  Finally, the story of Moses and the liberated Israelites emphasizes \"the building of a society that welcomes the outsider and uplifts the downtrodden\" (300).  Perhaps with exasperation and hope, Feiler finally exclaims, \"We are as much a nation of strangers today as at any time in our history, and more in need of the unifying call Moses offers to free the suffering, build a nurturing community, and befriend the stranger\" (302). For all its good, \"Prophet\" ultimately left me more informed but frustrated.  What I see in Feiler's Moses-inspired chronicle of American history is a nation-state struggling to appreciate its past while moving toward that vaguely defined Promised Land of a brighter tomorrow.  As Feiler and many others have shown so clearly, the American understanding of \"the common good\" has been significantly shaped by Jewish-Christian values and the sacred books of those two religions, the Old and New Testaments.  And its clear that this so-called \"Judeo-Christian\" tradition still shapes the moral assumptions of many Americans.  However, there's also a clear move away from letting these traditions explicitly shape public policy and, I would argue, therefore, explicitly shaping a shared sense of what the common good look like. Feiler uncovers an important American ambiguity about the role of religion in public discourse.  Americans still use a religious motif - Moses and the Israelite Exodus - to tell the story of American progress, even as that story transgresses a biblical notion of the common good.  In other words, many of like the general themes of the Exodus as long as we don't take that God stuff too seriously. Feiler obviously has great admiration for his Jewish tradition, but I get the frustrating feeling that his commitment to American ideals threatens to whitewash the rich nuance of the Bible.  Worse yet, this way of telling history subtly submits the broad sweep of God's salvation history throughout the Bible to American history; the Bible becomes one more important piece of the great American pie.  The biblical God is replaced with the (American) \"universal God\" (238). When the biblical story becomes one stream feeding into the American river, Moses overshadows God and becomes the prototype for \"human possibility\" (308) or the prototypical leader (302).  For example, Feiler wonders in amazement why Moses is actually such a small part of the Torah (i.e. the first five books of the Bible).  We shouldn't be surprised by Moses' absence.  The story, after all, isn't about him!  The whole biblical story, including that of Moses, is about God, the one God bound and determined to save people.  That's why there's an Exodus.  That's why Moses was called - to be an actor (albeit an important one) in the drama of God's saving grace.  And that trumps the American story every time. \"America's Prophet\" is a worthy read.  It doesn't clear away the American ambiguity surrounding \"religion,\" but it does give a clearer picture of the past while holding out hope for a future Promised Land. *This review refers to the Advanced Reader's Edition made available by the publisher.",

If Brittanys voice can charm us with echos of Dickens and Else Homelund Minarik, it can also shock and abhor us when it comes to Herrikhan. The contrast can be jolting at times which I think works in the stories favor, after all Herrikhan is horrifying, a brutality, cold and dark, come to invade the warmth and light we hold as Christmas.

He is a sinner and a genius, a chaotic man and a passionate, he is a machismo and a vulnerable human being, he overcame the WWII, the Polish ghettos and the Holocaust as a resilient child and he lost his wife Sharon Tate and an unborn child in 1969 by the Manson Group massacre, and on the other hand he overcame (as an adult) a special pattern of machismo-self-destruction (with 13 year old girl accusing him of sexual contact). He had lived a lousy life in Nazi-surpressed Polish ghettos and he had lived with too much pride and arrogance in Hollywood, he was arrested in the United States and nevertheless now he releases movies in Paris (presently married with French actress Emmanuelle Seigner).

         5,
         "This is one of the most gripping courtroom dramas I ever read, and I have read it a number of times. Deborah Lipstadt, an Emory University professor, wrote a book, \"Denying the Holocaust,\" ripping the lid off of critters who distort one history's most horrific episodes of genocide and organized slaughter, turning it upside down, presenting it as a hoax, making the victims into blood-sucking liars and the perpetrators into innocents or heroes. The purpose of denying the Holocaust, of course, is to make Nazism a legitimate political force and continue Jew-hating. Remove the Holocaust, and Nazism goes from being a genocidal sadistic kleptomania to a tough, rough, but viable form of ethnic nationalism, which builds good roads and fights Communism. After Professor Lipstadt published her book, one of the people she assailed (almost in passing), Englishman David Irving, whose career as a historian was on the downswing because of his open support of Holocaust denial, sued Prof. Lipstadt. Irving did so in a British court, which places a heavy burden on defendants -- they have to prove the plaintiff is wrong, instead of the plaintiff having to prove he is right. As matters turned out, Prof. Lipstadt whupped Irving pretty effectively. She assembled a crack team of historians, who presented reports that ripped Irving's research and knowledge of history bloody. Her barrister, Richard Rampton, tore Irving apart on the witness stand. At the end, the judge ruled for the defendants, shredding Irving's reputation as a historian, calling him a liar and a racist. Prof. Lipstadt's book is a fascinating, well-written account of her side of the trial, and three aspects of it jump out at the reader: one is the meticulousness with which she defended her right to free speech. (Irving offered to drop the suit for a $650 payment to a charity for disabled sailors and soldiers, as long as she and her publisher apologized and pulped the book. Prof. Lipstadt wasn't going to do that. Irving later used his \"offer\" as proof that he was being a nice guy, and the trial was all her fault.) Instead of buckling, Prof. Lipstadt assembled a team that said the simple thing: Irving was indeed a liar and a bully. The second aspect was the emotional ordeal Prof. Lipstadt went through through the trial, which alternated between the horrific (cross-examination about how Auschwitz worked) and the bizarre (cross-examination about Irving's links to neo-Nazis who insist that modern dancing be banned in favor of jigs and polkas) and the surreal (Irving addressing the judge as \"Mein Fuhrer\"). It was an immense struggle for Prof. Lipstadt, who often was physically and mentally exhausted by the stress. I cannot even begin to imagine how she held up. Knowing that you're on the side of truth is not enough. The third aspect was the bizarre nature of Irving's case -- throughout the text are her comments and those of her solicitor and barrister as to the strange stuff that Irving was spouting or including as evidence. The theory of his case was that Prof. Lipstadt was the pointed tip of a Jewish spear designed to destroy his reputation as a historian, but he did a fatuous job of doing so. The best he could do was produce a nutty California professor who said \"Jews stick together to create chaos.\" Prof. Lipstadt's side didn't even bother to cross-examine him. Irving also produced the highly esteemed British military historian Sir John Keegan, and didn't even bother to prep him, let alone meet him. Keegan took the stand and said, \"I'm here under subpoena, and think your idea that Hitler didn't know of the Holocaust is absurd and defies common sense.\" Irving tried to then impeach his own witness, failed, and Sir John was dismissed. In between, Irving did odd things, like present the plans for the PoW camp at Colditz, which showed a delousing shed, which somehow proved that Auschwitz \"deloused\" prisoners, not murder them. He also ridiculed the defense for not having a black lawyer on its team, while denouncing the BBC for having Sir Trevor MacDonald broadcasting the news (Sir Trevor is black), and saying he (Irving) had black female staffers, \"who have very nice breasts.\" Sometimes he came off as a pompous clown. He was most upset that he could not have his Darrow-Bryan moment of confronting Prof. Lipstadt on the stand, and presumably playing the role of Clarence Darrow, hoping he could break a Jewish woman into tears and confession a la Perry Mason. Oddly, I've read American analyses of Irving's case, and he could very easily have done better in an American courtroom. Irving, being ignorant of American law, misunderstood the Sullivan decision, and could have sued Prof. Lipstadt there. He could have hired an American lawyer on contingency to handle the case (better than Irving), and sat Prof. Lipstadt across from him during discovery to grill her about his theory that Prof. Lipstadt was the point of a Jewish conspiracy, and even cross-examined her. Ironically, Irving's prime argument, that the Holocaust didn't happen, would not have probably flown in American courtroom. An American judge would likely have simply tossed it, saying that was taking \"judicial notice\" that the Holocaust happened, and the only question would be Irving proving that Prof. Lipstadt had falsely and/or maliciously libeled him. But I don't think that Irving actually sued Prof. Lipstadt to win money or push Holocaust denial...he wasn't doing too well as a one-man book publishing enterprise, was getting negative publicity, couldn't sell his strange books too well, so he figured that by suing Prof. Lipstadt (and hopefully, winning), he could get back into the spotlight he craves, get taken seriously as a serious historian again, and sell his books. He actually did get that -- he got a lot of media interviews after the trial was over, and his catastrophic closing argument was more aimed at shoring up and impressing his supporters than winning over the judge. But in the end, he drew more ridicule than applause, and many of his confreres in anti-Semitism were annoyed that he didn't call them to testify as \"experts on his behalf. Instead of being known as a \"great\" historian, he's universally described as a \"disgraced\" or \"racist\" historian. Prof. Lipstadt writes movingly and powerfully of this incredible struggle for truth and emotional ordeal, with rigor, gravitas, humor, and restraint. She showed incredible courage and determination in the face of vicious cynicism, hypocrisy, and raw evil. Hers is a book that should be read now and for all time.",

Deborah's wit and ability to articulate the various stages in an authentic and lively way made it not only an important work but interesting to read. I can't count the times I smacked my forehead and blasphemed at Irving's stupidity and bizarreness. Um, ultimately uncle Adolf was NOT an antisemite but the best friend the Jews had?? No doubt the pustules that continue to support him will cook up word-soups in an effort to salvage him from this, but he is exposed for what he is. It was hard to get my head around why a man who told deliberate lies would sue somebody thus risking his lies being exposed; that seemed counter-intuitive to me. But it became apparent through reading the book that Irving is a couple of sausage rolls short of a packed lunch. This case portrays a man who is delusional about his own greatness; he sees himself as a messiah of sorts and perhaps believed that he would get away with the twaddle he peddles. To say nothing of his view of himself as a poor, beleagured martyr/victim of those nasty, greedy, conspiratorial Jews. I may cry. From a personal point of view: He should rot in a very warm place for his treatment of Holocaust survivors - gleeful spiteful treatment that he's actually proud of. Scumbag.

         "Several years ago I read David Irving's book \"Hitler's War,\" expecting it to be an informative general history of World War II. I was a bit perplexed when the book barely even mentioned the Final Solution against the Jews, and how it generally whitewashed Hitler's role in this and other Nazi atrocities. I didn't dwell on it at the time, and only learned later that Irving is an unabashed Hitler apologist, who has been mostly discredited as a historian, and who is prone to conspiracy theorizing and suing his critics. This book is by a credible historian that Irving sued for libel, Deborah Lipstadt, who published convincing evidence that he is a \"holocaust denier.\" This book covers the trial that, due to the procedures of British law, became not just a defense against libel accusations but a debate on the history of the holocaust itself. Lipstadt and her publisher emerged victorious, due to the sheer weight of the evidence from history, proving that it was not libel to make the extremely obvious claim that Irving is a \"holocaust denier.\" That certainly makes this book worthwhile, but there are some problems with Lipstadt's reporting on the trial. I agree with some other reviewers in that she is quite self-centered, describing how she kept second-guessing her lawyers and the judge almost every day. She frequently criticizes the judge for treating Irving's court tactics in an evenhanded or impartial fashion, as if it were not his job to follow courtroom procedures in a respectable way. Lipstadt also often complains about the unfavorable differences between British and American law, which all turns out to be little more than melodrama, because she already announced at the start of the book that she would eventually win the case. More fundamentally, Lipstadt recounts the trial testimony to such a detailed extent that this book becomes (inadvertently, I assume) a verbose condemnation of Irving's views and conclusions. This detracts from the book's supposed theme of justice, to a painfully obvious rebuttal of Irving's work. This was not entirely necessary because Irving's errors speak for themselves, as seen in the outcome of the case. There are some interesting allusions to the differences between selective interpretation (Irving) and convergence of evidence (everyone else) in the art of history, but this is mostly lost under Lisptadt's frequent self-aggrandizement about the righteousness of her struggle. Lipstadt did a great thing for truth and justice by fighting off Irving's desperate attacks, but there could have been better ways to report on this important trial. [~doomsdayer520~]",

After reading this book, I am definitely more supportive than before of American libel law (which typically places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show falsity, and provides that public figures can only recover if they show that their opponent was truly reckless): Britian's pro-plaintiff libel law, by encouraging libel suits, caused both Mr. Irving and Ms. Lipstadt to subject themselves to levels of scrutiny that I suspect few scholarly reputations could survive. One minor point: I wish Lipstadt had included some of the relevant documents (in particular, Irving's initial complaint) in the appendix so readers could follow exactly what the parties needed to prove.",

         "Although I'm not a sexually driven person by any means, I love theatrical costumes, burlesque costumes included.  If you are similarly inclined, this book may be for you.  If you're seeking a history of burlesque or fetish art, you should probably look elsewhere--while there are some historical details strewn throughout the text, most of the narrative is autobiographical.  Dita von Teese led an interesting life, by her account, so this aspect of the book is no detriment.  Even more of the book consists of full-page photographs of von Teese in various costumes: some of them dazzlingly beautiful, some of them extremely revealing, and all of them eye-catching.  Almost every page contains an image of von Teese looking glamorous.  She never wears the same costume twice.  Furthermore, each chapter devotes a page to tips for capturing the style of a female beauty archetype from a particular decade of the twentieth century: the vamp of the 1920s, the film siren of the 1930s, etc.  By the way, these tips tend to assume that the reader's skin isn't dark--she who wishes to emulate a vamp authentically, for example, must have deathly pale skin--so one may need to either modify these lists or disregard them altogether. The aforementioned narrative section is what prevents me from assigning this book a higher rating, but not because of von Teese's autobiographical focus.  Her choice to write about her personal past is not a problem.  The author's sexual politics are what really detract from my enjoyment of the book.  In the conclusion to the \"Burlesque\" half, she states that some people ask her whether her act incorporates any feminist elements.  Her reply is that it does IF you define feminism as she does, which is to be as feminine as possible.  In other words, the answer is no.  Obviously, no one was expecting her to say yes.  She's a burlesque performer.  Burlesque is a fantasy release, and fantasies do not necessarily take the realities of life into account.  They're make-believe.  Why she won't simply be honest about her line of work and say, \"There's nothing feminist about burlesque, but it's still a lot of fun,\" is baffling and frustrating. Similarly, the \"Fetish\" side is also problematic.  I take no issue with von Teese's preference for playing the damsel in distress in her bondage scenarios; again, it's a classic fantasy.  The sentence that raised my ire was this: \"I think that if we could admit that everyone enjoys seeing a naked woman, the world would be a better place.\" Anyone old enough to be reading this book knows that this viewpoint is patently untrue.  Then again, as evidenced by her reaction to LYSISTRATA at the beginning of the \"Burlesque\" section, Miss von Teese doesn't seem to want to admit that some men simply aren't attracted to women, just as a few of the photographs in the \"Fetish\" section point toward a trivialization of female homosexuality--as in, they use lesbian implications solely for heterosexual male arousal, a concept that von Teese apparently not only finds acceptable but expects readers to accept as well.  On a related note, the gay men who do appreciate women's beauty usually like to see them *clothed*. For those of you who think I've been taking this book too seriously, I invite you to look at the list of von Teese's recommended books in the \"Fetish\" section.  It contains, among other entries, the Marquis de Sade's JUSTINE and Anton LaVey's THE SATANIC WITCH.  The former, far from being a \"sane, safe, and consensual\" adventure, happily details a woman being tortured nearly to death dozens of times, and the latter is a second-person anti-feminist manifesto that tells women that they should welcome men treating them as sex objects.  If these are the books that von Teese deems worthy of recommendation, then she either hasn't read them or is deliberately sending unambiguous messages about what she considers her own--and, by extension, all women's--proper place in relation to men. In summary, if BURLESQUE AND THE ART OF THE TEESE/FETISH AND THE ART OF THE TEESE were simply an adults-only coffee table book with makeup and costuming tips and some autobiographical tidbits, I would give it a four-star rating.  As it is, I find it too offensive to endow it with a full recommendation.",

         "Ok, I have to admit was enjoying the book until the last 25 percent. It felt like the author was under the gun and pushed to end it. Annoying parts of the story, author kept stressing the beta male theory like it was an explanation for stupidity. That came into play about 75 percent through the book. Essentially beta males are what prolonged the species through pity sex. A beta male has great imagination but little to no self respect and likes to fatasize about getting the better woman and taking what one can get. Second annoying part was towards the end and I do have to spoil this because it had me disgusted. Essentially Charlie finds out that the evil harpy demons from the sewers got stronger because the bimbo Buddhist who was taking the souls that they were collecting in the objects was pushing the human souls into dead animal parts and having them steal other souls since she was under the misguided conclusion that Charlie and other death merchants were evil. Now major problem with this is that she was using animated dead animals to spy but jumped the gun and started the apocalypse by making evil stronger. Since Charlie is a beta male he overlooks this bimbo Buddhist shortcomings like starting the apocalypse and sleeps with her. She is essentially responsible for souls being eaten, animating dead animal parts with human souls, stopping people from dying, and essentially playing god. I thought the ending was some what circular. So i can say i enjoyed the humor up until the end it became absurd. I can only give it 3 stars. Would have been 2 but final ending very circular to the story. Very, Buddhist!",

         "My family has always loved the Berenstain Bear books-- from my own youth, through my now-6 and 4 year old daughters, to my new baby. These books usually have a great lesson to teach, and a fun story to tell. THIS book only told a story, NO the trademark Berenstain Bears lesson, and not a very good story, at that. The worst part was how mamma forced the cubs to eat vegetables with their dinners-- the story presented it as though no kid would ever want to eat a vegetable. My kids love vegetables (not that they don't love fries), I don't want them hearing Brother Bear saying \"why do vitamins have to taste so bad?\" What's the point in trying to make it harder for kids to eat well? I HATE when books or tv shows do this. Even though my family is pretty traditional, it bothered me that the whole deal was that mamma was tired from doing all the home and child care, so papa decided to treat her to a night out. As the previous reviewer, I just changed a few words for that. I used to buy Berenstain books on the name alone, I trusted them to be good. Now I'll have to check reviews first when possible. I have liked other of the newer Berenstain books, though. I hid this book under a bed after the first read, we're never reading it again.",

         "Having read and adored Lamb, I decided to try another Moore title.  I have to admit, I was let down.  Upon the death of his wife and the birth of his daughter, Charlie becomes an agent of death.  The premise sounded intriguing, but there were so many moments where I just rolled my eyes and though, \"are you kidding?\"  I easily identified Moore's attempts to be clever, but it just didn't come off as funny.  The contrast of such a dark subject with humor and witty banter felt contrived like a mishmash of Dave Barry and Anne Rice.  Charlie's fiendish supernatural pursuers were obnoxious and the underworld mythology lent to the ridiculousness.  While I liked many of the characters, their motives and actions lacked common sense.  Moore's identification of Charlie as a Beta Male turned into a theme that could have been funnier if it wasn't so redundant.  The interpretation on the afterlife lacked any degree of faith and hope, which is at the heart of many people's beliefs. There is despair in the idea that souls are relegated to inanimate objects. Overall, it was a mildly funny supernatural thriller that lacked suspense and had a pretty obvious conclusion.",

         2,
         "While this book contains many interesting and illuminating anecedotes of personal courage (or the lack thereof), it fails on one key point. Kidder argues against moral relativism, suggesting (based on interviews) that honesty, respect, responsibility, fairness, and compassion are universal values. These are just words, however, and they can mean very different things to different people. To people in a very communal culture, responsibility might be used to mean the individual's responsibility to the community. In more individualistic cultures (and in the philosophy of Ayn Rand) it would more likely mean responsibility to self. To some fairness means equality, while to others it can mean extreme discrimination. A refutation of moral relativism demands that different people agree upon the same meanings, not merely the same words. With this failure, Kidder's entire case falls down. He presents moral courage as \"the string\" holding together the pearls (of moral values). When those very values are in question, moral courage becomes undefinable.",

         "Take a look at your hometown newspaper on any given day.  You might read about a deadly fire that could have been prevented had a city or town inspector been doing his or her job honestly and diligently.  Or there just might be a story about a high ranking elected official who is abusing the public trust they have been sworn to uphold.  Or maybe a group of high school students have been caught plagiarizing their term papers.  How do you react when you read these kinds of stories?  Are you outraged or do you merely shrug your shoulders and yearn for the \"good old days\" when people were more responsible and more accountable for their actions. As we enter the increasingly complex world of the 21st century, it has become quite apparent that there is a need for more and more of us to display \"Moral Courage\".  Much to my amazement, author Rushworth Kidder reveals in the opening pages of his book that a search on the internet revealed that no one has ever written a book on this specific subject.  To Kidder there are three elements to \"Moral Courage\"--an individual must have principles, there has to be an element of danger or risk involved and one must show a willingness to endure.  As a means of illustration, the author cites numerous real-life examples of individuals who found themselves facing very real ethical dilemmas.  Some of his subjects would fail the test miserably while others would respond in a heroic way.  Kidder goes on to explain that the most difficult moral dilemmas are not those situations where the choices are clearly \"right against wrong\" but rather the situation that commonly occurs where one must struggle with \"right vs. right\" choices. I cannot think of anyone who would not benefit from reading \"Moral Courage\".  Like it or not, each one of us is bound to face a number of thorny issues and moral dilemmas during the course of our lifetime.  Rushworth Kidder has given us all lots of food for thought in his fascinating new book.  Highly recommended.",

Turning to her best friend (and fellow social outcast), Donnie, the two married and moved to the Big Apple, where Donnie became a musician and Harriet a renowned artist. But Donnie's untimely death meant that she had to accompany their son to Doolittle when his gran is sick, and when Harriet runs into grown up music producer Jake, who's in town to meet his father's fiance, he doesn't realize that she's the Harriet from his past, as he sets about wooing her. What happens when he runs into the son he never knew he had? North's breezy romantic comedy has a bit of a recycled plot, but the lead characters keep it from being just another hefty girl gone thin and getting the boy story mixed with the love child angle.

         "There's a distinction between comedy writing and using humour in fiction.  In the first, the comedy is the foundation.  Anything that can be inserted to confirm the framework will find a place - somehow.  Using humour to enhance an idea or lighten an approach is often welcome.  Using humour as an additional aspect of developing a story requires more finesse and care than having comedy as a starting point.  Moore, who possess a delightful wit, and a fine sense of story-telling, has created a comedy novel.  While its topic, the existence and handling of souls, might seem to be a serious matter, in Moore's hands it becomes merely a foundation upon which to exercise his skills at jollity. Charlie Asher has inherited a second-hand clothing store in San Francisco, The City of Two Bridges.  He's also suffered the devastating loss of his wife in childbirth.  The sight of a black man clad in a bizarre green outfit in his wife's room initiates a further turn in Charlie's life.  Alone, almost, with his new daughter, Charlie tries to rebuild his shattered life.  Other deaths, some right in the streets of The City, have a certain intimate relation to him.  Particularly when some of the departed appear to have been sent on their way by his daughter. Charlie manages to track down the man in the green suit.  He is also a dealer in second-hand goods - music CDs.  It turns out these items and certain of those in Charlie's establishment have special properties.  They carry the souls of certain of the dead.  The items are in these stores in order to be conveyed to new owners.  The man in green, \"Minty Fresh\", tells Charlie he's one of San Francisco's half-dozen \"Death Merchants\".  They are located there [and elsewhere as it turns out], because The City of the Two Bridges will be invaded by the Forces of Darkness if they fail in their task.  They are but temporary stand-ins for the Real Death - the one with a capital \"D\" who is due along at some future time.  Since Moore has depicted Charlie as a \" Beta male\" [thus displaying his ability to keep up to date with the latest theories of evolutionary psychology], we are given a West Coast version of Woody Allen without the scandals.  Charlie would like a more elevated status.  What more logical promotion than to rise above being merely a Death Merchant.  He decides he's Luminatus, the real Death, and struggles to assume the role. In depicting Charlie's coming to understand who and what the Luminatus is and what is expected of Death as a force, Moore is at his best.  Charlie's awareness grows through various events, including the death of his own mother.  Charlie encounters the Forces of Darkness - in fact, one tries to seduce him in an alley.  As the Luminatus, he knows it's his job to defeat them, if he can only learn how.  He even gains support of a sort from an SFPD Inspector, who seems mildly interested in \"weird\" events.  Charlie's major vulnerability is his daughter, Sophie.  She matures wondrously as the book skips over several years.  Charlie tries to help along her development through a series of unfortunate episodes dealing with animal pets.  The problem is finally solved by the unexpected acquisition of a pair of huge dogs - hellhounds. To anybody even slightly versed in the fantasy genre, these monstrous canines give away the game.  Why are they so defensive of Sophie?  They are omnipresent, except when lured away by somebody [something?] aware of their predelictions.  And they are an endless source of amusing anecdotes by Moore's depiction of Charlie attempting to explain them.  In stories of \"magical realism\", the fantasy world hovers close to the real world, just out of sight.  In San Francisco, the Forces use the sewer system, which, in Moore's hands, make the Paris system seem simplistic.  Charlie must meet them on their own ground, and it's clear he's poorly equipped to deal with the challenge.  He needs better support than a mildly sceptical copper, and sure enough, someone arrives to save the day.  Who that is must be left for the reader to learn.  A quick glance at the book's dust jacket or any chapter heading suggests the answer.  That's a bit of a surprise on the publisher's part.  And gives the ending a rather formulaic aroma.  Getting to this point, however, is part of Moore's genius.  In most ways, the book is a fine cliffhanger.  It excels much of his other work in some ways, falling short in others.  It's a must for Moore fans and a great read for anybody who likes inventive writing.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]",

At least he was normal, until the day he accidentally walked in on Death--well actually, one of his minions, the dapper and cool Minty Fresh--and finds himself as one of Death's Little Helpers as well, collecting the souls from the newly departed and saving these souls from unscrupulous use by a set of female demons and their wicked lord. Once Charlie gets the hang of it, he finds out that it's not such a bad job, makes him a decent living and gives him plenty of time with his daughter Sophie. There's just one flaw. . . it seems that the Sewer Harpies (as Charlie comes to call the female demons) are growing stronger. So strong in fact, that there will be no other course of action than a ferocious battle for the world, between the forces of good and evil. Charlie is alternatively helped and hindered on his path by the sort of wonderful characters only Moore could create. There's Lily, the wise-cracking teenaged Goth and \"creepiness child prodigy\" (who quickly became my favorite), and Ray, an ex-police officer searching for love on Asian dating sites. Charlie's sister Jane -the Alpha Male that Charlie isn't- gives Charlie strength and love--all the while looking better in his suits than he does. Even Charlie's daughter Sophie, who grows up before our eyes, has some odd tendencies--bad luck with pets, one very dangerous word, her own personal hounds from hell and the typical child's memory for things that one was not supposed to hear in the first place. Of course, one couldn't expect her to be completely normal, given her father (who was convinced he saw a tail on her six-month sonogram) and the influence of her unintentional hilarious babysitters, Mrs. Korjev (and her bears) and Mrs. Ling (and her wok). Even Charlie's enemies are wonderful; I adored the Sewer Harpies with their bickering, evil ways, puppet shows and continually amusing antics. In addition, Moore throws in a few return characters from other books which was a thrill for the Moore fan. I was especially glad to see the Emperor again. Charlie's experiences as a soul collector are both funny and touching. As is so often the case with Mr. Moore, a surprising tenderness turned up on some scenes. There is one scene in particular (the cheese scene--read it and you'll agree with me), that made me step back and say, \"Wow! I need to be sure I appreciate life to the fullest!\". Terminal illness, hospice care, nurses, and death all received a reverential treatment at his hands--while still being funny in that twisted Moore way. A Dirty Job has overtaken Lamb as my favorite Christopher Moore novel and rates a full five stars. Pick it up and join Charlie the life of death. It's a dirty job, sure, but somebody's gotta do it!",

         4,
         "In Jig and Reels, author Joanne Harris (most famous for her magical realism novel Chocolat) treats her readers to a selection of twenty-two stories, only one previously published.  Some, such as the playfully defiant \"Faith and Hope Go Shopping\" are surprisingly realistic while others embrace Harris's trademark fascination with fairy-tale lore and magic realism.  \"Gastronomicon\" unfolds as a young wife decides to experiment with recipes near the end of the ancient cookbook given to her by her mysterious mother-in-law.  \"Ugly Sister\" and \"The Little Mermaid\" re-tell fairy tales in a more modern, more twisted way.  \"Class of 1981\" explores, as Harris says, \"what happens when the magic runs out . . .\"  Some stories are little more than conceits - in the final story \"Eau de Toilette\" we meet a parfumier of another time who just happens to be someone famous.  This uneven collection remains an exhilarating read, mostly because Harris seems prepared to try anything, to slyly poke fun at expectations and cultural traditions. I wish that Harris had not chosen to preface each story with a short explanation of why she wrote it; it takes the magic out of the illusion.  Once the reader gets into these stories, however, he'll find them witty and much more vibrant than the bland introductions.  Even those stories which cry out for greater development, or a less-than-rushed ending, will charm readers with their originality.",

         "...have been fond of Roald Dahl ever since I read \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" in second grade, but I never got around to reading Matilda until now. This is a fantastic book, and is easily one of Dahl's best, with his trademark loveable, oddball characters and sense of invention and wonder...what startled me most about this book was that Dahl included some very mature themes in the final few chapters. Without giving away any plot twists (and believe me, there are some good ones here), the issue of child abuse is brought up. The characters don't dwell on it, but for a mature reader like myself who has seen children's entertainment deteriorate into mindless, sugar-coated garbage, it's refreshing to see such things mentioned. Young children will realize the seriousness of what is being said but won't be overtaken by it, which seems like the ideal way to make them aware of these issues. Thank you, Mr. Dahl, for reminding us of a time when children's stories could be both fun and meaningful. On a lighter note, I'm getting more used to Quentin Blake's new illustrations. While I'd still prefer to see copies of Dahl's novels with their original drawings, Blake's style fits Matilda quite well, and even gives Miss Honey her due and makes her really pretty. All in all, Matilda is a book for everyone, and adults will enjoy reading this book to their children.",

         "When I was thirteen, my Mama took me to our local library and introduced me to her favorite authors. These were the acknowledged masters of the \"Golden Age of Mystery Novels\"-Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Ngaio Marsh, Rex Stout, Dorothy Sayers, Erle Stanley Gardner, Mary Roberts Rinehart, etc. They kept me busy-and reading-for a good many years. In fact, I still go back to them, with great anticipation, and am seldom ever disappointed. Even the occasional anachronisms are fun! How then, could I pass up \"I dreamed I married Perry Mason\"?  I couldn't, it's that simple. I rather like the trend of using real (older) characters in new books, as long as it's done in a sensible fashion. Here, the author really does a great job of telling us more about the man, Erle Stanley, and his various series of books. I loved the Donald Lam/Bertha Cool books as much as those about Perry Mason and Della Street. I knew nothing about the earlier books, which makes me want to go find them. CeCe Caruso is a delightful, mature lady-not an oldster, by any means, but not a young chick, either. Thank goodness! She's bright, and insecure, and persistent-admirable qualities, all. Her love of vintage clothing is an added fillip. One wonders which of today's fashionistas will be so celebrated in 40 years as the great names of the previous century. CeCe has a career, too, as a biographer whose books are actually published. Good for her! When she gets stuck mid-way through her 6th book-about Erle Stanley-she stumbles over an intriguing letter to the Court of Last Resort, an offshoot of Gardner's early career as an attorney. The clues to the mystery involved are scattered throughout, but not blatantly displayed, leaving the reader to wonder a bit. The research involved is awesome in its complexity, and presented in a very accessible manner. The secondary characters-and the plots in which they are involved-are an exotic bunch, but after all, they do live in La-La land! The writing is terrific: engaging and extremely descriptive with ample humor, as well. CeCe isn't afraid to occasionally deride herself or her foibles, but never gets maudlin about it. Bring on Nancy Drew, I say! And after that-who knows?",

         5,
         "I just finished the book and there is only one assertion in it with which I have trouble. On pages 288-289 the authors discuss the special election that was held in The Bronx's 24th CD in February, 1948 which was won by Henry Wallace supporter, Leo Isaacson. Certain assertions about that election were not true. The authors wrote that the election was held as a result of the incumbent's untimely passing. Actually the incumbent, Bernard Rabin, was elected to a 14 year term on the NYS State Supreme Court in the 1947 general election and resigned his House seat to take on his judgeship, thus giving rise to the vacancy and special election. He did not die--I was at the Bronx-Manhattan Democrat judicial convention, held at the Coucourse Plaza Hotel in September, 1961 at which he was renominated. Isaacson's Democrat opponent, Karl Propper, was his perfect foil in that election. (An aside, Propper's wife was a source for Robert Caro on the early life of Robert Moses for which she was given credit in \"The Power Broker\".) Propper was the attorney for the Bronx landlord's trade association and as such handled all the evictions for Bronx landlords during the 1930s. His name was featured on all the eviction papers--not a pretty thing during the Depression and was still remembered in 1948. (The Bronx Democrat organization, for all its closeness to FDR under Ed Flynn, was still the place where \"establishment\" [not so liberal] types found a home. Karl Propper typified them.) Leo Isaacson was an Assemblyman at the time of his election, but from the opposite side of The Bronx, representing a district that consisted of Riverdale and West Kingsbridge. He was elected as a coalition candidate of the Republicans and the American Labor Party (like East Harlem Congressman Vito Marcantonio and NYC Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, strange as that might seem today). Yes, the Truman administration's posture on what was then called \"Palestine\" was an issue but it was not the only one. Yes, there was a large Jewish population in that district but there were also large pockets of Irish-American voters in Port Morris (where labor leader George Meany grew up), Polish voters in Hunts Point and black voters such as the parents of Secretary of State Colin Powell in the Southern Boulevard--Intervale Avenue and Prospect Avenue part of the district. Special election, being the low turnout affairs that they are, the most motivated turned out and elected Leo Isaacson on the American Labor Party ticket. The assertion that the 24th CD was some kind of \"red belt\" is simply untrue. Isaacson was the only ALP candidate who ever was elected there on that line alone. Although the American Labor Party did get more votes there than in most other districts and it is true that leftism was, as Norman Podhoretz puts it, \"in the fog\" of that district the ALP was always a minority voice as was its offshoot, the Liberal Party. The working class Jews there belonged to anti-communist unions such as the ILGWU and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union which had, as the Radoshes stated, withdrew their support from the American Labor Party after it was taken over by the Communists and formed the New York State Liberal Party. However, the main point that the election was seen as a warning sign that failure by Truman to support the creation of Israel would harm his election prospects a few months later was absolutely true and the fact that Ed Flynn was at the White House right after that special election attests to that fact! But for the foregoing, it was an accurate and great book. Thank you Harper Collins and thank you Ronald and Allis Radosh!",

This book has layers of mystery--murder mystery and family mystery both past and present.  It is also a story of race in the south.  The writing is quite good and the story is compelling. The story takes place in small town Chabot, Mississippi.  Larry is white and is an awkward kid who does not fit in with his classmates or his family.  He grows up to inherit his father's automotive shop but he has no customers.  Silas is the town constable.  He is black and was a baseball star in high school and college.  He returns to Chabot after military service.  Larry and Silas have a complicated past.  In high school, Larry takes a popular girl on a date.  She is never seen again and Larry is accused of killing her, though he was never convicted due to lack of proof.  Nonetheless, his life is ruined in the small town and he is the victim of gossip and harassment.  In the present, a local college girl goes missing and Larry is accused of killing her.  Again, no evidence is found.  Eventually the truth comes out, but there are a lot of wounds in the process. The novel moves back and forth in time and alternates between the perspectives of Silas and Larry.  The mysteries slowly unfold and they both find friendship and the beginnings of redemption.  The atmosphere of the \"Deep South\" was well done in my opinion.  The story was very compelling.  I could have read this in a couple of days if my schedule allowed.  The writing was evocative and beautiful.  The solutions to the mysteries were not too surprising, but they were well done.  There is a nice slow unfolding to the story.

         "A young widow, tormented by her loss, surrounds herself with the exotic animals that remind her of the rainforest and the time she spent there with her husband on their idyllic honeymoon. That time out of mind, the intensity of experience cannot be regained once they return to the city, only remembered. A plastic surgeon has the power to change lives. He loves his work, sculpting perfection into the human form. But, careful as he is, mistakes, misjudgments are made, the psychological sabotaging of the results of his scalpel. People are, after all, victims of their own perceptions, sometimes unable to allow themselves the joy, the opportunities of their new lives. Part of the housekeeping staff at the Echo Terrace condominiums, Yesenia is only nineteen, her whole life yawning before her. One evening, lost in the dark beauty of the city, she waits too long to start home and darkness falls, rendering the streets more dangerous. She finds herself alone on the subway, a young man stalking her. All of these people, and more, are part of the complex humanity of Echo Terrace, where Farro Fescu is the concierge, a Rumanian lover of lists. Disappointed in life, but burdened with a romantic soul, Fescu finds comfort and direction in his lists, a manner of managing chaos, keeping track of all his charges and their needs. Too easily he becomes mired in his disappointments; the lists soothe him, allow him to cease struggling. Rinaldi's characters are complex, challenging stereotypes, full of the dichotomies that plague most people, the ambiguity of routine, the occasional prick of conscience, the distance of real passion or emotion; they act out their roles, playing the parts they are assigned, indistinguishable in this respect. But their interiors are jumbled and patched, unrecognizable from their everyday selves. Inside, reality plays havoc with their souls. Those who live in Echo Terrace are well-off, urbane, and proud to be a part of the bustle of New York. Those who work there, the shadow-people, entertain more cautious expectations. In this place, the author has built a sculpture of personalities, each a new armature attached to the body that defines the form, like branches from a tree, interconnected. Just as people affect each other in immeasurable ways, this entity changes minutely, a living piece. If Echo Terrace is the matrix, all those who live there contribute to the dimensions. Finally, they are united in purpose, grateful to have survived their city on that terrible day in September that changes the world forever. Luan Gaines/2004",

         "Between Two Rivers : A Novel is Nicholas Rinaldi's third novel.  I thought his previous novel, The Jukebox Queen of Malta, was one of the better books of the year in 2000. Rinaldi has followed up that success with another blockbuster novel.  Set in a Battery Park condo, Between Two Rivers is an expertly woven quilt of a novel that brilliantly illuminates the subtle bonds that develop between people who, by chance or by choice, happen to live together. The story revolves around one Farro Fescu, the inimitable Romanian concierge, who watches with keen eyes the comings and goings of the intriguing inhabitants of Echo Terrace, as the building is called.  The building's name itself conjures up the themes that permeate this book-memory and shared experience.  It is through this wonderfully energetic and nosy concierge that Mr. Rinaldi introduces the other residents, each with a wonderfully engaging and, often, enigmatic story to tell. The condo's residents mirror the ethnic, intense and farcical nature of New York.  Although a novel in format, the construction of the book approached that of a collection of short stories in some respects as Rinaldi explores the inner workings and motivations of each character, but he always segues adroitly back into novel mode as he approaches the interrelationships and dynamics of the Echo Terrace's emotional and interrelational ecology. This is a book with first rate characters, elegant writing, dynamic construction and, ultimately, a book that provides one with a tremendous sense of satisfaction. Rinaldi just gets better and better.  We can only hope he has many mode books in him.",

         "Arguably, this is the best collection of short stories ever published by Joyce Carol Oates.  Her focus in this book is trauma, from the most personal and emotional to the most global, i.e. The World Trade Center Disaster.  Her elucidation of the psychological is center stage in all of her stories.  Each story depicting a truly personal trauma, the book takes the reader through the pain and effects of the death of parents, the influence of serious mental illness, the difficult love and emotional interactions of a student who is seduced by a teacher and many other topics that reflect what we have seen going on in the American Society in the last decade. Always, there is the ever present hardscrabble existence of those in the Upstate New York environment, the struggle to make a living, and the struggle just to live with the prevailing conditions of the region.  The struggle to live and live with one's own thoughts and experiences is truly brought to the surface. From a writing standpoint this book finds Joyce at the apex of her short story writing career.  The stories are carefully crafted, with the use of multiple literary techniques.  Her use of phrases to highlight and illustrate specific intensities of thought and feeling are wonderfully blended with a writing style that grips the reader like a pipe wrench.  The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters time after time.  Her stories do not always resolve, leaving the reader to extrapolate the future of the characters.  The pictures she paints with her words are explicit and the most intense examples of human reality.  This reality is mixed most explicitly with the internal feeling of most of the characters that they are unique and that they are \"No One You Know.\" The book is recommended for all serious readers of modern literature.  It is a classic in all respects.  Do not miss this opportunity to read some of the best short stories ever put in one book.",

Her carefully crafted facade is just vulnerable enough to allow for her journey from street urchin to the ultimate best friend. The reader intimately feels her hurts, both physical and emotional. As Xhea risks her life to save an unlikely friend, she must learn how to manage a dark magic that is as rare as her ability to see ghosts, all while pitting herself against the forces of a society she wishes would both save her and leave her alone.

         "Christopher Moore is at his best when he stretches himself.  He can keep cranking out amusing books set in Pine Cove and San Francisco, and I will joyfully continue reading them.  But it is the rarer and more challenging works (such as his prior novel LAMB) that I really look forward to with relish. Fool is Moore's take on Shakespeare in general and King Lear in particular.  Once again, Moore has set himself the challenge of finding the comedy in an epic tragedy.  In Fool, now that I think of it, he uses a device similar to the one he used in LAMB--a charming and ridiculous narrator.  This is Lear told from the point of view of the court jester, Pocket, a character as endearing as any that Moore has written.  Through Pocket's eyes we learn more about the goings on in Castle Lear than we have been privy to in the past.  And, we learn the fool's own fascinating life story.  It is possible that devotees of the Shakespearean original did not realize that the Lear household actually revolved around the fool? I don't know that there's much point in giving you a Cliff's Notes version of the plot.  Lear was the elderly king of all Britain.  As the play/novel opens, he has decided to divide his kingdom among his three adult daughters.  The division will be determined by who loves him the most.  (That's fair, right?)  The two eldest, Goneril and Regan flatter him mightily.  Only the youngest, Cordelia, speaks truthfully and modestly of her love for her father.  But her sincerity is lost on Lear.  He flies into a rage.  He disinherits Cordelia and divides the kingdom between Goneril and Regan and their respective husbands.  Lear's best friend Kent says, \"Hey, this is crazy.  What are you doing?\" and gets banished for his trouble.  And so it begins, eventually leading to murder, war, madness, and so forth.  This ringing any bells? You may be asking, \"Where's the fool?\"  That's just it.  Pocket is everywhere.  He's telling the story.  He is the witness to it all.  He knows the entire back story, has all the family secrets, knows how those three girls lost their virginity, etc.  And you know that's going to come up, because this is a Christopher Moore novel, after all.  Shakespeare may be hallowed ground to some, but Chris Moore isn't above throwing in a little bathroom humor, some gratuitous sex, and a joke or two that'll make you groan.  Actually, I don't think Will Shakespeare was above any of those devices himself.  Some of the humor is terribly erudite and sophisticated and some is well, idiotic.  (Literally, as it happens.)  Say what you will, this novel is laugh-out-loud funny! I'll be honest, there were times when the mixture of comedy and tragedy clashed a little uncomfortably for me.  It's a freakin' depressing story, y'all!  But Moore's twisted take on Shakespeare and his obvious love and respect for the Bard are all but brilliant.  Bravo, Chris!  Do keep stretching those literary and creative muscles.  This is your best work in years.",

If Short was involved with them, the author also makes no connection between Ms. Short's medical issues and his father the physician...I would have expected the vast amounts of information about her medical 'stuff' to be bought up in the book.

         "For anyone who has been longing for a book in which the central relationship around which the story revolves is a really amazing friendship rather than a romance/love triangle (because let's face it, you can only listen to the Wicked soundtrack so many times, and romance is all well and good but one can't live off a diet of romance alone), this is the book you have been waiting for. RADIANT is a book full of wonderful things, and there is so much about it that I love. I love the detail that the author has built into the world that has grown out of the remains of a ruined city. The tiny elements of world-building that lurk in crannies and around corners like the mysterious creatures heard shuffling around the streets at night. I love how the author explores ideas of morality, the contrasting worlds of light and dark, as the shining towers of the City above contrast with the ruined skyscrapers and caved-in subway tunnels of the Lower City. The Lower City lives and breathes -- its sights, smells, textures, and tastes present both in vibrant colour and in the shades of grey seen through the eyes of our protagonist. But more than anything, I love the friendship between Xhea and Shai that forms the heart of the book. Two wildly different young women from two entirely different worlds, who would never have been friends in life, connected after Shai's death by a bond that surpasses the boundaries of the job for which they were originally brought together and becomes something wonderful and new. These are beautifully realized characters with hopes, dreams, faults, and flaws, and watching their friendship as it blossomed organically between them was my favourite part of a story full of wonder, mystery, fear, intrigue, and adventure. With an ending that resolves just enough to be satisfying in a way that makes you sigh as you close the book, while simultaneously whetting your appetite for the next book and the answers to questions that still remain, RADIANT has earned itself a spot on my favourites shelf for a long time to come.",

         "This was a light and pleasurable read this weekend, the latest in James Alan Gardner's \"expendable\" universe. I read the first novel when it initially came out several years ago and then failed to notice the intervening releases. I was pleasantly surprised, when I started reading this one, that missing the in-between novels didn't affect my enjoyment of this book. The \"expendable\" universe is one where humanity has ventured to the stars and promptly found that there are many alien cultures out there, most of which are far more advanced than man. These cultures have a rule against killing sentient life. If you do it, and then try to leave your solar system, you are zapped as a \" dangerous non-sentient\". Humanity splits into two cultures, the Technocracy and the Unity, one averse to tinkering with genes and the other gung-ho about it. Nicely though, unlike most of our history, these two cultures don't fight each other....since doing so would get them all erased as non-sentients....they just kind of bicker like a divorced couple. In this novel, Ugly Screaming Stink-Baby, otherwise known as Youn Sue, is a 19 year old cadre of the Explorers, an arm of the Technocracy Navy. the Explorers are scouts that are sent ahead of the regular Navy to explore new worlds, and to determine all the myriad things that can kill people on them. Think of the expendable ensigns on the old Star Trek shows and you'll get the idea. Actually, that probably is where Gardner got the idea. Naturally the mortality rate within this elite group is high; so the technocracy response i sto satff the Explorers only with humans that are disfigured. Thse people are considered expendable. In this delightful tale, Youn Sue, a Buddhist, is first infected by a red, spore like sentience that calls itself the Balrog, and which is far smarter than any human. She then is called to rescue a group of Unity Scouts along with the indomitable Admiral Ramos and another explorer, Tut. The Unity scouts, although dispersed around the planet, all disappeared at once and the Explorer's are the closest group when the mayday comes in. They must solve the puzzle of the missing scouts and determine why the Balrog attacked Youn Sue, while fending off velociraptors on an archaelogical mystery planet. This book was a lot of fun and perfect light reading on a weekend when I had the flu. It's not destined to be a sci-fi classic but I did enjoy reading it.",

         "You be the jury.  You decide.  Did the author's father really kill the Black Dahlia and a number of other women in the Los Angles area, and was his guilt covered up by the Los Angeles Police Department?  These are all murder cases around 1950 that remain unsolved to this day. But author Hodel, a former LAPD member himself, believes he has solved the case...and the killer is his father!  No spoiler with that statement, it's in the liner notes.  After his retirement from the force, Hodel turns his attention to the Black Dahlia case and several others of that time period.  And although he and several others become convinced that the dad did it, I'm not so sure.  The first two thirds of this big book lays out the hundreds of investigative finds that Hodel believes prove his case.  I don't agree.  The evidence he presents seems mostly circumstantial to me and based on wild supposition and coincidences that stretch the imagination.  In fact, I find only one piece of indisputable evidence that connects George Hodel to the murder: a handwriting expert's analysis that determines that GH wrote the many notes after the murder that teased the press and police.  But, still again, it doesn't prove that he murdered the BD.  In the last third of the book -- added after the initial publication which found many nay-sayers, Steve Hodel organizes his proof, adds further information -- mostly from interviews, and tries to make a stronger case for his assertions. But as a member of the jury, I still find many doubts, not just shadows.  And why would the son do this to his father?  Simple.  Revenge. The dad did desert the son and his family when the boy was in his youth.  The dad did commit incest with the son's sister.  The dad did marry a woman, unknown to the son, and the son later married the same woman.  Plenty of reasons to hate the old man.  And there is one strong contradictory statement.  Early in the book, the son says his dad was totally against abortions. But later on, he connects him to an abortion ring.  So, fellow citizens, read it for yourself and decide for yourself.  I think it will either end up innocent or a hung jury.",

The photos are not even of the same person, and one looks a little like Gloria Vanderbilt, the other like a coarse version of Rita Hayworth. Okay, that said, we move on, and it becomes fascinating. I learned so much about the era, the sexual corruption of the times, the corruption in the LAPD, the social mores, it's great for that alone.

         "Let us, as they say, cut to the chase. If author and former LA cop Steve Hodel's father really did kill Elizabeth Short (`The Black Dahlia'), the discerning reader certainly won't be convinced of it by this book. In laying out his case, Hodel starts with a monumentally flawed premise, then spirals into a chasm of conjecture and supposition which we're expected to accept as evidence. Hardly what one would expect from a retired homicide detective. And that flawed premise? Well, Hodel believes that a pair of pictures in his father's old photo album are of Elizabeth Short herself. The problem, as so many readers and critics have pointed out, is that they just don't look much like Short. Hell, the women in the two pictures don't even look much like each other! But as badly as it starts, Hodel's case against his father goes nowhere but downhill from there.  Rather than solid evidence, the author conjures wild theories that - perhaps in his mind alone - tie his father to Short's murder. Somehow, for Steve Hodel, his father's friendship with eccentric artist Man Ray adds up to a clue. Somehow a photo by Man Ray of Dr. George Hodel posed beside a bronze sculpture of an ancient god adds up to evidence that Daddy was a murderer. Or there's Hodel's assertion that Short's body was posed where it was found, arms above head to resemble - ready kids? - a famous Man Ray photo. (Isn't this how her arms might naturally have fallen, especially if her killer dragged or carried her by her wrists when he left her?) And, in a glaring inconsistency, Hodel reports that authorities were afraid to go after his father for the Short murder for fear of being exposed in scandal (as a VD clinic doc, Doctor Hodel supposedly had the goods on various local officials), but had no problem at all charging him with molesting his daughter in a high profile case just a couple of years later. There are other big inconsistencies and questions left dangling in Steve Hodel's book, too. Early on, he's stunned to find a picture of his former wife in the same photo album in which his late father carried the alleged Dahlia photos. But he'd learned YEARS earlier that his father had been in love with this woman. (Of course, he had been stunned then, too.) So why was it such a shocker to find her picture among his late father's belongings? Elsewhere, Hodel claims that he didn't find out his father had been on a list of Dahlia suspects until well after his father's death. But considering that one of the younger Hodel's partners in the LAPD had been assigned to the Dahlia case for a time, well, is this entirely believable? Whether or not Steve Hodel believes his own story, of course, is open to speculation. But despite the flimsy `clues' he gathers against his father, the author gives us ample evidence regarding the deep hatred he feels for his dad. There's his father's absence and eventual abandonment of his family. The alleged abuse of the author's sister at the hands of Dr. Hodel. The relationship between Dr. Hodel and Steve Hodel's first wife. Given the sheer volume of parental misdeeds reported here, Hodel isn't especially convincing when he writes of having a certain affection for his father later in life. Thus, the likelihood that this book is mere posthumous revenge seems fairly high. Perhaps some of this could be forgiven if Steve Hodel could at least make it all more compelling. As it sits, \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" is a meandering mess of a book packed to the gills with confusing side stories, digression and truly awful prose. Consider Hodel's description of his moment of (incorrect) recognition that the pictures in daddy's photo album are Elizabeth Short: \"It was she. The Dahlia. The Black Dahlia.\" It's bad romance novel-level writing at its finest. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is nowhere near that hilarious.",

         "I'm actually amazed by the negative/lukewarm commentary received by this book - and at the misrepresentations of its contents that justify the lack of enthusiasm. As someone whose primary interest in true crime is the Ripper case and the Maybrick Diary, I now have an even better understanding of why it's difficult to put old mysteries to rest with late-discovered evidence, no matter how solid it is.  People like mysteries too much to want them put to rest, and they'll even turn ugly when denied their fix. Be that as it may, Steve Hodel has certainly found the proverbial \"smoking gun\" linking his late father, George Hodel, not only to the murder of the \"Black Dahlia\" but to a number of serial killings in the Los Angeles area in the late 1940's.  He found several smoking guns to that effect - and to the effect that the cover-up of George Hodel's involvement stemmed from the highest reaches of the LAPD, including two former police chiefs.  I'm amazed that anyone would claim otherwise. People who would argue otherwise are simply misrepresenting.  The photographs that Hodel found in his father's photo album are certainly those of the Black Dahlia, Betty Short. What's more the poses in which she is engaged in both the George Hodel photos AND as a result of the staging of her corpse as it is found on the crime scene bear more than a superficial resemblance to the photography and artwork of Man Ray, regardless of what anyone else says. And it's sheer disingenuousness to say that his case against his late father is based solely on those photos.  In addition to the handwriting expert that he found linking his father's handwriting to that of the notes, there are a thousand other clues which the gainsayers would ignore, but if I were to go too deeply into them, there would be no need for anyone to buy the book. Even assuming for the sake of argument that some of this evidence could be defended away, what are the odds against Steve Hodel coming to the conclusion that his father was the Black Dahlia killer INDEPENDENTLY of similar conclusions found in old LAPD/District Attorney files - if indeed this was not the case? How is it that Steve Hodel is able to convince the lead district attorney of Los Angeles County that he has solved the Black Dahlia mystery - and yet a few recalcitrant critics remain unconvinced? There are some questions that Hodel left unanswered that I would have liked elucidation on.  Among other things, he implicates none other than renowned actor/director John Huston (who died in 1987) as a friend of his father's and a co-participant in various acts of sexual deviance.  Is there any reason to implicate Huston as actually having participated somehow in the murders or having obtained guilty knowledge before or after the fact?  Hodel doesn't tell us. Admittedly, it's difficult to maintain one's professional objectivity when working on a personal matter, and if this were an ONGOING criminal investigation in which his father was involved, Hodel simply would not be allowed to remain on the case.  With all of the goodwill and professional judgment in the world, he could not be expected to remain objective. Yet the dryness of Hodel's tone as he is engaging in the criminal investigation - a dryness that sometimes detracts from the book's readability - suggests that he was able to maintain enough objectivity to proceed and certainly the evidence that he produces seems irrefutable to reasonable people. Hodel's own relationship with his father when he was alive was a checkered one - his bitterness towards him for abandoning his mother vanishes in later years when he meets his father again and they begin the long slow process of reconciliation.  How was Hodel personally affected by his professional conclusion that his father was, in fact, a sadistic serial killer?  He tells us his reaction to this conclusion, but I think that he stops just short of saying all that is in his heart. While some - maybe the same people who yet shriek \"fake\" when confronted with the Maybrick Diary - insist that the case against George Hodel has still not been proven and continue to take comfort from the placebo that is the \"still unsolved mystery\", others will recognize that Hodel's placing of a name and a face to the image of Elizabeth Short's killer actually deepens the mystery - the mystery of the human heart. How could a highly-educated man capable of the poetic depth that George Hodel was capable of demonstrating on the surface be equally capable of such depraved crimes?  His son gives us glimpses of an early incident in his father's life that might have been the spark - but even at that, it hardly seems sufficient to explain so many possible murders, as well as the brutality of the Elizabeth Short murder - which involved prolonged torture before death. And I, as I am sure many readers were, was struck with the horrible dichotomy of the extent and atrociousness of the murders - the Black Dahlia murder in particular - and their perpetrator dying peacefully of natural causes at the age of 92.  It leaves me uncertain whether this COMPATIBLE OR INCOMPATIBLE with the notion of God's justice.  That George Hodel could have escaped retribution on earth challenges the notion that the universe ever evolved from Chaos, but equally inconceivable would be the absence of divine retribution for these crimes. These are questions that his son does not even attempt to answer for us.  He is a retired cop and not a theologian, and anyway it is surely at this point where his objectivity must falter.",

I did not want to be disappointed by one of my favorite authors.  And I never was! I really can't add much to the plot description, only that I found the last few lines on the novel being a very nice touch.  The novel reads easily, the action, the events, the intrigue flows effortlessly.  There is humor found almost everywhere.  There are also \"Star Wars\" artifacts lurking on pages and knowing what a big fan Suzanne is, I thought that she might have written a contemporary title just for the fun of being able to mention \"Star Wars\" in there. The romantic scenes are also done with much more \"freedom\" than those in historical titles.  And there is much more humor and fun in them too. After reading this book, I can't now decide which I like more:  Suzanne's historical titles or her contemporary one.  I am very hopeful that she will not stop at just one contemporary novel, but I am also looking forward to her next historical one too.",

         "Enoch's first contemporary novel is fresh, sexy and witty; having read all her historicals I was wary of how she would translate into the 21st century, but Flirting was probably her best novel to date. Sam Jellicoe is a premier cat burglar who's attempt to relieve British billionaire Rick Addison of an ancient collectible goes awry when a bomb kills a security guard during the job.  Sam rescues Rick from the explosion (a nice switch) and, now a murder suspect, leverages his gratitude and her black market connections to persuade him to help untangle the mystery. The book was fast-paced, the dialogue was snappy, and the sexual tension between Sam and Rick keeps you nicely distracted from the sometimes-convoluted plot.  At times the suspense was undermined by drawn out conversations about possible suspects and improbable plots as Sam and Rick tried to solve the mystery.  Early hints also left little doubt about the identity and motives of the villain, though the 'how' was elusive enough to keep me interested. However, one of the best things about this book was watching Rick's character change as the story evolves.  Rick was introduced as a bit of prig; judgmental about Sam's nefarious profession even while using her experience to decipher the plot against him--but by the end of the book he was much closer to accepting her past.  What made this transformation unique was Enoch's decision to avoid the usual whitewash, i.e., she was a thief because she had an abusive childhood or was valiantly supporting a younger sibling with her life of crime, etc. The book also appears to be the first in a series, reminiscent of JD Robb/Nora Robert's Naked in Death; though less gritty and more focused on romance than suspense.  The characters also echo Naked, though here the criminal tendencies are on the female side, the male lead's charming accent is British, and the tone is much more light-hearted. I very much enjoyed the book overall and look forward to reading the next in the series.",

         "I don't know where to begin with this book.  The author's main contention is that his father, George Hill Hodel,  was the black dahlia killer.  His two main pieces of evidence are photo's of Elizabeth Short that he supposedly found in his father's photo album after his father's death, and notes that match his father's handwriting that the killer mailed to newspapers and police after the dahlia death. The photo's he found that he claims are Elizabeth Short are clearly not her, her chin and bridge of her nose completely different. The author doesn't go to any facial recognition experts or use computer software to prove his claim that the photo's found his father's album are elizabeth short.  He spends two sentences on that subject saying he thinks they are the same.  CBS 48 hours mystery recently exposed this issue, hiring a forensic artist, who using software determined with 85% probability it is not her. His second piece of evidence is the handwriting of his father and the notes the killer supposedly wrote to the newspapers and police. Assuming the notes are even written by the killer and not mailed in by a hoaxer, the author submits one handwriting expert stating it is the same handwriting.  48 hour mystery hired two handwriting experts, both concluding they are not of the same handwriting. I can imagine how many handwriting experts the author must to went too before he found one that agreed with him. You would think with 500 pages of material he would have more than two pieces of evidence against the suspect but no he does not. The rest of book is biography hybrid of Father and the rest of his family which has absolutely nothing to do with the black dahlia. Lastly, you can clearly see the author is completely conflicted about his father.  He hates him, for good reason, because his father beat him, molested and raped his sister, abandoned him to his alcoholic mother, and apparently had an affair with author's first wife.  But as you read the book, you can see he has admiration for his father, his intellect, often referring to him affectionately. While his father I have no doubt was a bad man, the Black Dahlia killer he was not. The author is clearly a good writer and perhaps he should try crime fiction entirely.",

The pictures of the women he purports to be Beth Short neither resemble her nor each other. One looks like a cute teenager and the other like a much older woman. Neither conjure an image of Short. While Hodel Junior sees his father as suave and sophisticated, he looks weak-chinned and ordinary, nothing of the charismatic lothario he's depicted as. That he had abundant drugs and money suggests he hosted some wild parties and knew some interesting figures of the times but nothing more. While it's nice to see that Hodel's superiors think his theory has merit, they should pursue the investigation. The evidence remaining from the unsolved murders can be tested in light of this evidence. Hodel Senior's peers and their children can be interviewed, and his trail to Manila should be pursued. If he's truly the mad murderer Steve Hodel has us believe, the trail shouldn't stop cold. If he's truly the detective he claims to be he should pursue this and offer solid proof not conjecture based on memories of a less than perfect father.",

Replete with photographs, handwriting analysis, \"thoughtprints\" as Hodel terms an experienced, successful investigator's impressions and intuition, and a chronology of the events of the Black Dahlia case, this book is hard to put down.  You will stay awake reading.  Hodel's conclusion that his father and another man were serial killers of attractive, vulnerable women, will chill you. Unlike some others who wrote about the Black Dahlia, Hodel views her with a sympathetic eye, feeling that she was a young woman who wanted what most do---a loving husband, a home, children. Adrift in post-WWII era Los Angeles, she encountered instead George Hodel, and met a violent end at a young age. Hodel is to be commended for his long, meticulous search for the facts, for his own hunches on how to put the facts together, and for his brutal honesty as it became increasingly clear in his own mind, that his father had been responsible for the death of the Dahlia and probably for many other murders.",

This is one of the best books I've ever read.  I'm 3/4's of the way done with it, and it has changed me.  I cried my eyes out, I laughed, and I learned so much about John and even about life.  Not every entry is spectacular, but many of them are, including Julie Gold's, which moved me and my husband to tears.  (Someone criticized her in another review.)  I suppose if you're a complete cynic and are convinced that Yoko is the devil, you'll be too prejudiced to see what this book really has to offer, which is this:  As much as I thought I already knew and understood John and Yoko, I now REALLY understand, as if I'd spent a week with them.  John was an outstanding person and artist with no ego.  Yoko is an artist with an out-of-this-world whimsical and spiritual viewpoint, and out of the hundreds of women he met, he chose her to be his woman and his teacher.  He was not controlled by her.  If you think Lennon could be controlled by ANYONE, you don't know the first thing about him.  He was his own man more than just about anyone, and he chose and cherished her.  They have a connection way beyond this life, and it is this book which FINALLY explains it, if you read it with an open heart.  It has honestly changed my life, and I feel dreadfully sorry for those too solid (as in not light and free) and jaded to be able to experience something as pure and truthful and honest and beautiful as this jewel.  I thank Yoko from the bottom of my heart. By the way, I'm no goody-goody.  I can confront evil, and I know bad literature when I read it.  This is goodness and brilliance.  Elliott Mintz's essay, for one, is pure gold.",

         "I bought this book with happy anticipation.  It seemed like a good idea:  a collection of essays by different people, remembering John, published 25 years after his untimely death. I had seen a similar collection of statements many years ago, soon after John died, and that one was moving.  But I overlooked one important thing:  this book was edited by Yoko Ono.   Why the 2 star rating?  The book itself is good quality and has a few nice pictures. And some of the essays are nice such as the ones by Mick Jagger and Elliot Mintz. However too much of the material is of poor quality for different reasons.   The book smacks of one of Yoko's popularist art projects.  It appears as if she invited a bunch of people, some who never met John and who probably know little about him, to send in an essay so they can get their name in print.  An essay by Alicia Keyes is nice, but she didn't know the man. How could she have a memory of John?  As a result, several essays repeat the same unimaginative theme:  we liked John because he wrote Imagine.  We never met him but we like the song because he sang about brotherhood and peace.   Other essays are so short as to be meaningless.  Some contributors sent in amateur drawings or poetry.  This may be fine for an elementary school project where a teacher tells her 7 year old students \"write a poem or do a drawing about John Lennon\" but, to me, this is not worthy of a hardcovered book obstensibly published to honor John Lennon.   Another problem with this book is the same problem mentioned by critics of the Lennon Broadway show:  the Yoko-fication of the Lennon legacy.  While many of the essays address John alone or John as a Beatle, I could not help but notice that many of the essays not only discuss John, but practically deify Yoko.  We learn from these essays that Yoko was the love of John's life; that she was a talented artist; that her genius wasn't appreciated years ago, but that Yoko was 30 years ahead of her time; that people did not appreciate Yoko because she married a Beatle; that Yoko did NOT break up the Beatles; that Yoko had a tremendous positive influence on John, etc. Did I mention that Yoko was the editor, and thus had a say in which essays were chosen for publication and which were not?  It seems obvious that the \"deification of Yoko\" was a factor in choosing certain essays.   While I enjoyed the contribution by Elliot Mintz, he goes into great detail about The Lost Weekend, and mentions different people John saw and places John visited.  But not one mention of May Pang.  No, just like in the Lennon Broadway show, May does not and did not exist.  Did I mention that Yoko was the editor of this book?   Many different people made contributions to this book, but oddly there is no memory of John essay by Julian, Sean or Yoko herself.  One would like to think that John's second wife and sons would have something special to say for this 25th anniversary offering.  Not one word.   And just in case you've forgotten who the brilliant editor was of this masterpiece, Yoko is mentioned on the front cover, the back flap, wrote an introduction, and has a full paragraph in the back of the book describing her \"accomplishments\" as a musician and artist.   My suggestion?  If you are a fan of Yoko Ono, you will appreciate this book.  If you are a Lennon or Beatle fan, you may wish to take it out of your public libary or buy a second hand copy at a discount, but otherwise, skip it.",

         "I am astounded by two things associated with Steve Hodel's \"Black Dahlia Avenger.\" * This is NOT just about the Black Dahlia murder. This is an absorbing and painstaking reconstruction of events associated with the murder of Elizabeth Short, as well as about a dozen other sex-related (and to date unsolved) murders of women across several years in Los Angeles. * There is an amazing volume of mean-spirited venom about this book that, in my view, feels disproportionately harsh, given what author Hodel, a former homicide detective who has investigated more than 300 murders in the Los Angeles area, has accomplished. Hodel is not an amateur sleuth. His credentials are solid. What's best about \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" is until the very end, Hodel maintains an eerily professional sense of detachment about everything he uncovers. There are no sensationalistic pronouncements (or even sensationalistic photos) - and whenever he launches into something unproven, he tells the reader up front what must remain in the realm of \"speculation\" - while expressing an opinion that feels like common sense. Hodel writes and acts like the former homicide detective he is; and only at the end does he allow the reader a window into his emotions. Yet this is an engrossing read, accessible to all. It reads and tracks better than a fictional whodunit. \"Black Dahlia Avenger\" is simply one of the finest true-crime books ever written. Author Hodel is so exhaustive in his research, he even devotes an entire chapter to what five decades of \"mythology\" associated with the Black Dahlia have done to taint our view about the crime and the victim herself. Hodel explores everything: the possible nature of Elizabeth Short's relationship with his father, police corruption and payoffs, the motives behind covering up or destroying evidence, the significance of an illegal abortion ring and its relationship to the LAPD, the relationship between the police and the press, the circle of \"friends\" the murderer and his accomplice had, their obsession with surrealism, sexual submission, etc. - an eerily timed incest trial involving his father and half-sister, an oddly coincidental 40 years worth of self-imposed \"exile\" by his father that in retrospect appears related to fears linked to the Dahlia - the list goes on and on. Yet best of all, Hodel does the most prudent thing any detective would do before going public. Beyond conducting an exhaustive number of interviews, he obtains \"blind\" handwriting analyses from a forensics expert, and to further convince himself and the reader that he's on the right track, he submits all of his data, as in a real murder investigation, to a surprised and perhaps initially skeptical deputy district attorney, Mr. Steve Kay in Los Angeles. Deputy D.A. Kay, while qualifying his opinion as being his own, declares that based on evidence gathered, author Steve Hodel is correct; his father George was the prime suspect in Elizabeth Short's murder, and if alive, he would be prosecuted for this as well as for the murder of Jeanne French, which occurred a month later. The negative reviews are so shrill and insultingly dismissive that they go beyond trying to diminish author Hodel's accomplishments (e.g., calling it a \"Daddy Dearest\" screed; I assure you this book is not). They feel like an attempt to trash Hodel, to convince you his book shouldn't be explored at all, that it doesn't belong on ANY bookshelf. Maybe some of it isn't rock solid, but Hodel is up front about what is and what isn't, and is beyond careful, using qualifers to help the reader along. Some of the venom is focused on the author's discovery of two mysterious photos in his father's personal album that resemble Elizabeth Short. Some claim the woman doesn't look like the Black Dahlia at all. Well, one only needs to look at other photos of Elizabeth Short, and not just the few that appear in the book, to be convinced there is indeed a resemblance. Common sense dictates that absent a resemblance, Hodel's investigation AND his book would not have reached first base, let alone all the way to acquiring a favorable opinion from deputy D.A. Steve Kay. Perhaps in a later edition, author Hodel should include other photos of the victim, combined with opinions of renowned medical examiners, as part of his response to skeptics.  However, the photos were merely a launching point for Hodel's curiosity.  By the end of the book, the evidence gathered makes those photos superfluous.  His investigation in no way rises or falls on just two photos. After many decades of reading Dahlia books, I'm finally convinced that author Hodel has come closest to presenting the best and most plausible explanation of what happened, backed by voluminous research and exhibits. Give it a chance and read it from cover-to-cover. Trust me, this one is a winner.",

         "Based solely on the evidence presented in BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER, it's hard to believe that author Steve Hodel's father, Dr. George Hodel, killed Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia.  For one thing, the younger Hodel makes a number of assertions that undermine his credibility b/c they are obviously untrue.  The most important is that the young woman in two photos he found in his father's album is Elizabeth Short.  Clearly, she isn't.  (To see for yourself, compare these photos with the pictures in other books on the murder, for example John Gilmore's SEVERED.)  In addition to this obvious untruth, Hodel makes assertions he can't back up.  On pp 427-431, for example, he insists that his father and Elizabeth Short conducted an affair during 1944-1945, that the doctor wined and dined her at the finest restaurants, that he proposed marriage, that perhaps he assaulted her.  Nowhere in any of BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER'S 462 pages does he adduce evidence to support any of these claims.  It all makes a reader skeptical. Hodel also asserts that his father \"displayed\" the Black Dahlia's body in a pose taken from a photograph by his friend, Man Ray.  Well, maybe.  But in another book on the case, Mary Pacios uses an artfully-mangled mannequin from the set of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI to \"prove\" that director Orson Welles was the murderer.  And James Ellroy's novel speculates that Elizabeth Short's gashed cheeks made her resemble a character from Alexander Dumas' THE MAN WHO LAUGHS.  It seems that wherever you go in the Black Dahlia case, there's an artistic reference--but no way to tell which is valid, which isn't.  Besides, why should the posing point to Dr. Hodel?  Why not to Man Ray himself? Hodel's strongest evidence is handwriting, but even that doesn't link his father to Elizabeth Short, except glancingly.  The direct connection is to the \"Red Lipstick\" murder of Jeanne French three weeks after that of the Black Dahlia.  Clearly, the French murder could be the work of a copycat, but that's a possibility Hodel never explores.  A skeptical reader has to think maybe it's because the Black Dahlia crime is more famous, hence more likely to sell copies of the book. On the other hand. . .  since BLACK DAHLIA AVENGER was published, both NEWSWEEK and 60 MINUTES have learned that Dr. Hodel was indeed considered a Black Dahlia suspect by the L.A. district attorney in 1949.  His house was bugged, and the transcript yields some suspicious remarks.  But NEWSWEEK also reports more than 20 other suspects, and that the mass of the transcript tends to exculpate Dr. Hodel.  I'd love to hear the evidence that aroused the grand jury's suspicions, just as I'd love to have the Black Dahlia case solved after all these years. Difficult to believe as it is, Hodel's book may contain some grains of truth.  It's just that we need more than it provides--a lot more.",

His father's photograph was in the file, along with transcripts of electronic surveillance on his home for three weeks in 1950. The reports on onionskin paper that is yellowed make clear that Dr. Hodel was a prime suspect in the investigation of Short's murder. . . . The transcripts of overheard conversations include a statement in Hodel's voice saying, 'Supposin' I did kill the Black Dahlia.  They couldn't prove it now.  They can't talk to my secretary anymore because she's dead.'\" This may not be conclusive (and may well be to obscure for anyone who has not read the book) but it does prove that Dr. Hodel was the wealthy and influential Hollywood resident referred to by the grand jury and it proves that the LAPD or the DA's investigators zeroed in on Dr. Hodel without benefit of the two pictures that may or may not be Short that began the author's investigation. I, of course, do not know whether the author's theory is wrong or right.  I found this book to be highly entertaining and I think that it may have lit a fuse that may solve the case once and for all.  At the very least, it has caused previously secret files to be released.

         5,
         "Although this book is one of the lesser-known books by Thomas Merton, it is among his finest. Both content and style are immensely impressive. Consider the following passage: \"We have few words left in which to accept our Cross from God. We are poorer than Job. Like him we are tempted to curse the day we came into existence because our whole life is full of evil. But we do not have his eloquence. When we talk to ourselves we have even less to say than Job's friends. We have nothing. We may spiritually share the utter degradation of the Jews who, reduced to skeletons, walked to their death in the furnaces of Auschwitz... But it is licit to pray to God to be spared such extremes. We are poor enough as it is, and our poverty includes a tacit permission to be un-heroic. For this lack of show, this absence of all verve in our sacrifice, is essential to our age. There is no place in our spirituality for anything that inspires wonder, in ourselves or in others. And this is right, because man has lost all wonder for the things of God. He no longer marvels at anything except the prodigies of the Apocolyptic Beast. Hence it is right that our lives, and our prayer, should be empty of all that is wonderful. The supreme mystery is so hidden that it has nothing to show for itself at all, least of all a Gtterdmmerung, a sunset of the gods. Nietzsche speaking of our world, proclaimed that God was dead. And that is why, in our contemplation, God must often seem to be absent, as though dead. But the truth of our contemplation is this: that never more than today has He made His presence felt by 'being absent.' In this, then, we are most faithful: that we prefer the darkness, and in the very depths of our being, value this emptiness and apparent absence. We need not struggle vainly to make Him present, if such struggles are a mockery. Leave nothingness as it is. In it, He is present.\" (p. 121-122) I had a copy of this book when it was only available as an off-print, which came as a set of eight thin booklets. It's nice to have it in the form of a single book. If you are a Merton fan, you simply must have this book in your personal library. If you've never read anything by Merton, this book would be a great introduction to his works.",

The reading level feels a little off to me. It's definitely not a \"My First\" level, but it's borderline Level 2? And some of the words introduced aren't common words (like \"caboose\" which is great for this book, probably not going to be useful outside of this book).

After knocking off Brave New World from my to read list (which has been on it as long as SH5) and being terribly disappointed by it, I was afraid the same would happen here, that there would have been so much hype that it couldn't live up to it. I was very happily proven wrong in that aspect. While Im not really a huge fan of Sci-Fi, I do like books that have so focus on aliens (Rama!), and I really enjoyed the whole time travel/existing at all times aspect to be very neat. Weave in some real life war stories, and it turns out to be a weird, but awesome mix.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>I read this book 9 or 10 years ago and ...</td><td>5.0</td><td>I read this book 9 or 10 years ago and found it entertaining.

After reading the first book in the series I wasn't sure if I would continue it; but I am so glad I did.  This book is much better than the first one and incredibly interesting and engaging. I listened to this on audiobook and I really love the narrator of these books.  He is a pleasure to listen to and does an awesome job with character voices and emotion.  I would highly recommend listening to this series on audiobook. There is so much tension throughout this book, it just about kills you.  Sonea, Lord Robin, and the Administrator know a deadly secret about the High Lord Akkarin that they are desperately trying to keep secret.  As if this isn't enough stress Soneas fellow classmates have taken a strong dislike to her.  Sonea remains admirable through the book; she is smart and resourceful but continues to get caught up in events that test her.  I loved her character and my heart just broke for her throughout this book; there were a couple of times I just wanted to scream Enough, give the girl a break and some happiness! Much of the story is also told from Dannyls perspective.  I adored his parts of the book just as much as Soneas.  Dannyl does a lot of traveling and ends up on a quest to trace Akkarins travels and find out more about the ancient history of magic.  These parts of the book had a lot of adventure and history involved in them and I loved them.  Both Sonea and Dannyl develope love interests in this book; much of that is in the background but it was nice for these characters to have some happiness in midst of all of their trials. The only thing that really irked me throughout this book was everyones fear and assumption that The High Lord Akkarin was evil.  Yes, Sonea saw him practicing black magic but did anyone ever try to figure out why Akkarin would do that?  Throughout the book Akkarin remains alof, intimidating, and at times strict and even a bit cruel.  However, he is never outright evil and I cant help but believe he isn't the problem in this book.  It bothered me that all the magicians and novices that know his secret just assume that he is evil without finding out if maybe he has a greater ulterior motive.  It made me disappointed in the intelligence of the surrounding characters and seemed short-sighted to me.  I was especially disappointed in Robin and the Administrator. The other thing I found frustrating was how all the magicians turned a blind eye to how Sonea was tormented by her classmates; at times this torment is so severe as to be torture.  I found it disturbing that the adults in this book are okay with the students ganging up on and torturing one young girl. Overall aside from the above two complaints I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  The whole book is written in a fantasy style that feels a bit older to me (like 90s epic fantasy) and I enjoyed it a lot.  There is some excellent world-building in here along with a complex plot and characters that are easy to engage with and relate to.  The book ends on a cliffhanger that will absolutely kill you; I want to read the third book immediately!  I would recommend to fans of classic fantasy.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Command of language, turn of phrase, sense of humor, sense of place.</td><td>5.0</td><td>Gods exist because of our belief in them.

He meets a young black teen who offers to change the slashed tire on the car Crow's been driving. During the course of changing the tire, Crow learns that Lloyd drifts because he no longer feels welcome at home. His mother has a new man in her life who doesn't accept most of Lloyd's stories of innocence (no matter what the issue or problem). It's a brutally cold day out and Crow takes Lloyd to eat the evening meal and then to Crow and Tess' home. Tess isn't nearly as accepting of the young man as Crow but agrees to let him spend the night. During casual conversation, Tess mentions the death of an assistant US Attorney, Gregory Youssef. Lloyd has a strange reaction to the information. During the early hours of the morning, Lloyd decides to rob Tess and Crow. Instead of stealing a few items and making a getaway in Tess' Lexus, Lloyd is involved in a wreck and runs away on foot. Lloyd's strange reaction to Youssef's name bothers Tess and she sets out to find him. Tess' curiosity brings a number of unexpected legal and moral consequences. Crow takes Lloyd out of Baltimore while Tess faces a dangerous threesome from the government. They threaten to take her life apart and do the same with her parents, Crow, his parents, their relatives, etc. By the time they started overturning the rocks in Tess and Crow's lives, I was boiling mad. If the government can do even a portion of what is outlined in this book, John Q Public is in serious jeopardy. This is a slick story with lots of red herrings. Crow takes a more central position in this book and the reader learns more about Crow's character. I enjoy the fact that there are returning characters who grow and change, adding a new dimension. 4 Stars</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>The Graveyard Book and Good Omens are all Ive ever known of Gaimans work</td><td>5.0</td><td>I admit, I haven't read much Gaiman. The Graveyard Book and Good Omens are all Ive ever known of Gaimans work. And while I thoroughly enjoyed both books, I was never quite prone to picking up another one of his works. That has since changed. American Gods has been on my reading list for a while and after getting annoyed with myself for not reading it sooner, a friend of mine put it on our book clubs reading list. I was so thankful to finally have a reason to crack this one open. Do you ever have a book that just feels good in your hands? Well, my copy of American Gods was exactly like that. I loved just flipping through the pages and feeling its weight. That being said, this book was difficult for me to get through. Gaimans writing style is at its best. His proficient use in descriptions and alluring paragraphs does nothing but amplify the classic this book will become. However, I found the book exhausting to complete. Gaiman weaves in story after story that tell of the Gods of old. And while they do give a nice background to the characters involved, they mostly seem unnecessary and tiring. Gaiman did everything correctly in creating American Gods and his ultimate lesson in all of it is strong. But the ending left something to be desired. All in all, a decent read albeit long. I cant wait to see what they do with it in the TV remake.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>To have more, you must first become more</td><td>5.0</td><td>Are you entrepreneurial material? It's best to find out before you invest your money. Your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are. As a Master Trainer for the United Nations Entrepreneurship Capacity Building Program, I can vouch for the importance of a mindset change from being a technician, a task-doer so to speak, to providing results. Having technical capacity is not the problem; making your business a success is. That's where the managerial and entrepreneurial aspects of a business play a part. Let me give you an example: Having delivered more than ten thousand hours of training in several countries, I can affirm that the first challenge is in setting goals that give long-term vision and short-term motivation. For many people, the urge to jump right to action even before they set goals is strong, but as Yogi Berra used to say, If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else. In the book, Gerber quotes the book of survival by Anthony Greenbank who says, to live through an impossible situation, you don't need the reflexes of a Grand Prix driver, or the muscles of a Hercules, the mind of an Einstein. You simply need to know what to do. Don't think you will be reading a how-to type of book. Far from it. This book has a plethora of sharp insights for inspiration to set your attitude straight and begin producing results! You will understand that when you know the difference between working in your business versus working on their business, i.e., making your business grow. I highly recommend this book because instead of continue looking at your business as a one-off operation, you will see it a prototype for a large number of franchises you may add later on. Such simple mindset change will put you to work in the business not only as a technician but also as a manager (putting systems and controls in place) and, above all, as an entrepreneur (having a vision of how the business can create sustainable added value for all key stakeholders).</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Fascinating</td><td>5.0</td><td>I usually enjoy reading Mr. Gaiman's work.

The author is a Nobel prize winner, so I knew at the outset that this wouldn't be light reading. But the stories are truly fascinating. In the first tale I feel like a fly on the wall, listening to someone speak; is he remembering the past? Is he talking to his family, or to his wife, or to the pictures in his mind? The stories each left me slightly off-balance, not quite sure what I was reading. But the title story, Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather, suddenly centered me as the narrator looks into memories of his past and finds himself lost in change. The final story, In an Instant, fills most of the second half of the book. It is a beautiful piece, reminding me of a Chinese plate my grandmother had. I don't remember much about the plate, except that there were blue pictures, a temple and a bridge, trees, and a feeling that the closer I looked at one image the more likely I was to find myself in another. The writing flows in the same way between scenes, adding imagination to each and drawing the reader on with the movement of the prose. There's no story as such, but there's reflection and change; it's oddly mesmerizing, like that moment of falling asleep or of waking up, when objects take on meanings that really belong to something else. It takes much more than an instant to read, and stays longer than an instant in the mind, but it's beautiful in the same way as that plate. So now I'll go back and reread them all, in light of the mysteries of memory and time, and in appreciation of something truly different and impressive.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Brilliant</td><td>5.0</td><td>This book is part of a trilogy and will be one of those series of books fondly remembered for all time.

In it, we see Sonea actually moving into the Guild as a full-fledged novice, including classes and classmates. Sonea doesn't have an easy time of it, mostly because her background is unacceptable to most of her classmates. One in particular sets out to make her life miserable and turns the entire group against her and tries to make her look bad to the rest of the Guild as well. While not unfamiliar - it's an oft used trope, the first that springs to my mind is Talia's story in Arrows of the Queen - it's an effective one as most people and especially teens will be able to identify with it, as almost everyone has experienced bullying in real life, be it. A victim, a perpetrator or a bystander. Akkarin plays a larger role this time around; while he was an ominous, mysterious and shadowy figure in the background in the first book, he takes a far more active part here, though no less ominous. Through Sonea, we get glimpses of the man, but what we see is of course heavily coloured by her distrust and dislike of him. And I got my wish about seeing more of Dannyl and Lorlen as they both got their own points of view. We see far less of Rothen, due to the fact Sonea and Lorlen aren't allowed to speak to him or each other, and I missed the warm bond between Rothen and Sonea, as I loved those scenes in the first book. The addition of Dorrien, Rothen's son, is a nice one and gives Sonea yet another friend, but also another liability. Dorrien is a fun character and I liked that he brought some light and levity to Sonea's rather bleak world in this book. We also see more world building with Dannyl travelling abroad, not just Elyne, the land he's sent to as an ambassador, but also Vin and Lonmar. I like Dannyl's storyline, not just because of the chance to see more of this world, but also as it touches on another hotbed issue: about intolerance and accepting who you are in the face of it. I loved Dannyl's growth in this and the fact that the author shows that it isn't just those who blatantly discriminate against people who are 'other' who are harmful, but also those who just stand by and let it happen, even if they themselves don't feel that way. Sonea shows a lot of growth from the first book as well, she reads a lot older than she did in the previous book and she gains in confidence, power and skill, which make it easier for her to defend herself against Regin and the isolation she finds herself in after becoming the High Lord's novice. Regin is a cretin, I found him utterly loathsome and I still don't understand why no adults stepped in sooner to stop him. I loved how Sonea finally stood up to him and how smart she is in beating him without stooping to his level or hiding behind her status. The Novice doesn't suffer from second book syndrome. While it's a natural continuation of the storyline from book one and it sets stuff up for book three, it does have enough action in and of itself to not drag. I loved this second book and am looking forward to the next one, called The High Lord, to see if the finish of this trilogy is as good as I remember it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Great book.

We get more involved in some of the support characters and learn more about them. Trudi Canavan has spun a very enticing web of politics, action and magic however at times I have found the writing style to be wanting. The plot is just as strong as the first book with more twists and some of our questions being answered. Trudi keeps the reader absolutely confused about the reality surrounding the strange activities of the High Lord and this ambiguity is handled very well. I am sure Dannyl's character will appeal to many readers as he ventures on a journey of not just his new duties but self discovery. It did not take me long to finish this book and it was like a delicious bite of a flapjack just before the big crunch to finish it off! I have enjoyed this fantasy thoroughly thus far and would recommend it to all fantasy readers. It is different in terms of the plot, the \"world\" and the balance of magic and reality. However as I said before, the writing style could have been better.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Australian SF Reader</td><td>3.0</td><td>Sonea is now learning the magic arts, and has a sympathetic tutor, in general, but still has to deal with the rich kids, and boys who aren't fans of hers.

In this second book, Canavan is more assured as a writer and, most notably, sets up a much more contained story that, as a result, is more gripping. Again the book is hardly original in its elements. Sonea, our titular heroine novice, is at a school for magicians, after all, and we get a fair amount of the Usual Stuff in this area. But the setup quickly puts her, her mentor Rothen, and others into a difficult situation. Plus she has conflict with another novice. The character development is sensible and there is some palpable tension as the story progresses. Less good is the homosexual subplot involving Dannyl. While there is nothing offensive or bad about it, it isn't particularly necessary or even that well-developed. It doesn't serve any particular purpose, when really it should. Overall the book is enjoyable for the tension it develops. It's good beach fare and the high point of the trilogy.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>So much promise - and then ?</td><td>3.0</td><td>The first half or more of this book is lyrically beautiful. Paradoxically it is a memoir by a young woman whose lower jaw is destroyed as a child by a rare form of deadly cancer. The treatment that saves her life not only disfigures her but basically takes away her childhood at the age of 10. That she can review those years with poetry is remarkable, and that the poetry is beautiful is breathtaking. But the book is fundamentally flawed. The author is an 'unreliable narrator' in her own story. Her memory of medical procedures is very clear,and these are among the most haunting images in the book. Her memory of family, school and social events are cloudy, and I think we need to regard them as metaphorical more than factual. For example, it does not seem likely that her father could simply not come home from work one day, stay in a hospital for months before dying, that the author (who clearly loved him deeply) saw him only once and was casual about his death? It seems she is more comfortable talking about her face than about her life. The last one-third of the book lacks poetry or coherence,and simply fades away. Her 'insights' into true beauty do not ring true; there is no epiphany or resolution and I do not think any of us really believe that she finds peace.  As in life she did not. It's too bad. It could have been a beautiful book and a beautiful life.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>She loved this book!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I bought this book for my young niece who is obsessed with bugs, especially ants.

Shadow who himself might have some God in him is released from prison eager to see his wife he finds his wife has just tragically died.  Then Mister Wednesday happens along.  Wednesday for sure has some God Like powers and wants Shadow to go on a road trip with him.  His goal to gather soldiers for the upcoming War Of The Gods. Intermixed in the main narrative are side stories about The Gods Comming To America and many other smaller stories about the Gods. If you have seen the TV show this will greatly help you make since of the events. I would do the Novel first if asked but it can be done in any order.

This book drones on and on - the author took literally half the book - HALF - to finally begin to get to the point.  It's drudgery to read for this reason.  It wastes so much time in getting to the point - time that could have been spent in zeroing in on the important takeaways and how to apply them to your own situation.  The storytelling setup was intended to help us entrepreneurs get it, but it just was too long to get there; too meandering.  And it's repetitive after that.  Entrepreneurs don't have time to waste - don't make something longer than it needs to be for the sake of it just being longer (look at how condensed the One Minute Millionaire is).  Know this going into it so you can skim appropriately to get to the meat of it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Advanced Genius At Work</td><td>5.0</td><td>In 1985 I wouldn't have touched Vonnegut with a 10 foot pole.  All the \"good ones\" had already been written.  30 years later, everyone was wrong!  The Advanced Genius Theory states that when a truly brilliant mind seems to be in the senescence of a career, it [the big brain] could be producing its greatest works.  That may be the case here.  I don't think this is as good as his best novels.  I think this one stands out as far and away a great work.  I don't even want to call it just literature, because its really a kind of scientific paper, or one of those books by Stephen Jay Gould that throws in some data, anecdotes, talks with others, and tries to make a grand conclusion about something in nature.  Vonnegut does that in his least cloying, least clever and most truly natural and funny way here.  I am glad that I waited 30 years to read this book.

A Mesmerizing Commentary on American Values</td><td>4.0</td><td>Present day. United States. A young land where the beliefs of old withered amidst the speedy rise of capitalism. A land where time was money and there was no time for antiquity. The old gods grow restless as the new ones of Technology and Media grow powerful and ambitious. It may result in war, and at what cost and with whose lives? At the center is an unlikely protagonist: Shadow. Large, burly, slow to speech, Shadow is not slow of thought. A tangled youth and a complicated life send him down the wrong path, made worse for the loss of the one he loved. How does one even begin to review such a tome? It is literary, fantasy in a contemporary setting; skating the line between magic and magical prose. This is no slugfest of the gods, but a deep question of who we are, and what we stand for. Along the way we meet with a medley of characters you half know from legend, scraping by in a land that has forgotten them, their powers diminished. But there is a gathering, a last battle; one where you don't know if it is for good or ill. At times Shadow makes the oddest of choices, always furthering the book and intriguing, but not always consistent, but then, here is a man embroiled in turmoil that I can hardly conceive. If his decisions seem unlikely, so is his predicament. The one failing I felt for the book was an unfulfilled expectation. All along I expected the gods to battle, for magic to play a greater spot in this struggle. It does and it does not. Most of it is behind the scenes, alluded to with finesse and skill. It does not take from the book, only from my expectation. Which, coming from a love of epic fantasy, it is only to be expected that I would harbor desires of epic confrontations with visceral results. Instead the struggle is beautifully portrayed in prose that flirts and holds hands with the literary, but rarely feels overdone. This is a book to enjoy and one to make you think.

The ship is near Galapagos and we meet the few people who are either soon to die or soon to journey from Galapagos to a nearby island where they will make a home for the future of mankind (but they don't know that). The narrator is a ghost related to Kilgore Trout (recurring character in Vonnegut's works) and we get a bit of each person's backstory. Theirs quite a bit of Classic Vonnegut type commentary on the state if current society, how our current \"big brains\" function (human thinking) and how it differs in the future.

Therefore, I was surprised when I realized that the book was not what I had been expecting. It turned out to be so much more than just going through the emotional process with her. Even without my being able to relate to the childhood that she had undergone, I still found Grealy to be relatable. She does a very good job of communicating the normalcy that exists for someone who most would not view as normal. Immediately, I found that endearing. She is an award-winning poet and it shows in her writing, but for the most part, her account does not get lost in the indulgence that sometimes happens with poets. The structure is still clean and easy to walk through, as though you really are just walking along with the author on this journey. I found the last couple of chapters to have many moments of repetition. She struggles with the concepts of truth and beauty and continually re-mentions this challenge - often the same thoughts, just worded differently. These ideals are clearly important to Grealy and it shows in her need to keep bringing them up. With repetition being the case however, those moments can be taken with grace because there is an understanding that, given what her book is about, these are the focus items of discovery for her (and hopefully for the audience). All in all, I enjoyed it - she was charming and sweet in this account of her life.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Awesome! Love it!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Awesome! Love it!

Ingrey kin Wolfcliff has his duty: to investigate what seems to be a strange murder, and to bring to justice an even stranger murderess, one possessed of, and by, a leopard.  But, of course, not all is as it seems, and Ingrey ends up facing challenges moral, physical and, ultimately, philosophical, before his Long Night can end. This book has it all. Comedy high and low. Tragedy to make even the Gods weep. Treachery and forgiveness. Laughter and heartache. Mercy and vengeance. And the true horror implied by the words \"mostly dead,\" which for me will never again be funny. Above all, Bujold's characters are always *people*, with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies. Along with all of the above, this book is a most wonderful romance, as Ingrey and Ijada meet, utter strangers, and go on to find first friendship, and then love, and learn why their hearts must truly beat as one, if either is to beat at all. \"Hallowed Hunt\" is even better than \"Paladin of Souls,\" and I wouldn't have believed that possible before I had read it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>more than met expectations  would definitely reccommend this provider  recieved  earlier than proimised and in great dondition</td><td>4.0</td><td>more than met my expectations.  would definitely recommend this provider.

Compared to Cazaril and Ista, Ingrey is a pretty dull protagonist, and his love interest, Lady Ijada, isn't much better. After the other two,I expected an initially slow pace, but this one never really got going. And while the others spent a lot of time on the complex religion, this one got a lot more in-depth and included an earlier, native belief system. Generally, it was just boring. If I had picked it up first, I might not have finished it, but since I'd liked the first two, I decided to power through.

The book does deal with stories of the war after all, and there's no way to dress that up in any manner. The repeated element of the narrator saying \"So it goes\" whenever death is discussed is an odd one. It's there to sort of soften the blow of all the deaths that Billy has witnessed, but there's no dressing that up in any true fashion, I suppose. The book may seem a little confusing at first given the non-linear flow of events. At the very least all stories that take place during the way follow one another more or less chronologically leading up to the actual bombing of Dresden. Everything else is sort of fair game for mixing up and even I had a bit of a struggle putting things together right away. It doesn't help that I'm instinctively trying to read into why we're made to experience certain flashbacks in the order they are presented. It all has to make sense somehow, right? There are slow burn TV shows and this is a bit of a slow burn book, primarily because of its disjoint narrative flow. But when things come together, they really come together and the end result is pretty heavy. The whole notion of being able to travel back and forth along one's timeline does push the notion that our lives are more or less fixed and there's nothing that we can do to change the course of our lives. And while that sort of feels like a defeated attitude to take, it's a sort of understandable perspective to take when it comes to a man having seen a massacre like Dresden. Beyond the aliens and the time travel, this book is really about Billy finding a way to come to terms with what he had experienced during the war. There's the added challenge that he actually has to re-live the events over and over again at random intervals because of his odd new ability. And that could be enough to break just about anyone, but still he manages to persevere and he gains new perspective on things given his traveling. Slaughterhouse Five isn't an easy book to read, but it's certainly a compelling and fulfilling one. I doubt that this review can be used to help anyone write any sort of school paper about this book, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone tries to do precisely that should they read this review all the way to the end.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Slaughterhouse Five Review</td><td>4.0</td><td>After reading Slaughterhouse Five, I proudly gave the book four stars. I was fascinated by the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim's, journey. He \"time travels\" to various points in his life, an ability he says he learned from the aliens that abducted him. Without giving too much more away, you begin to see how every stop in his journey all revolves around the infamous firebombing of Dresden, the main setting of the book. The firebombing really changed him and reliving all of these moments gives his experiences much more meaning.  I also liked the use of actual imagery in the book. The pictures aid a little in making the story more personal despite the outlandish alien abduction. I did not like the vulgar language used in the book because I felt it covered up Pilgrim's innocence. This was more of a personal thing and probably was used for that same purpose. I would recommend this to those looking for a radically different read. The common phrase used in the book \"So it goes\" will probably become your own explanation for death as it was for Pilgrim, who experiences frequently. It would be the perfect epitaph for the man who has experienced it all and sees it all on a daily basis.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Slaughterhouse-five</td><td>5.0</td><td>The first time I read this, I was annoyed by the recurring phrase--And so it goes.

Unlike them, especially unlike Ista, he _is_ quite capable of physical deeds of derring-do. When we meet him, he seems to be trying to keep his head down (and on his shoulders) and do his job. However, his job brings him into the presence of a woman who reminds me, and possibly only me, of Cordelia Naismith Vorkosigan, from whom \"honor flows as from a fountain\" and he has to involve himself in great and perilous things for her sake.

The book is based on Vonneguts own experience as a prisoner of war where he, by a strange twist of fate, survived the fire-bombing of Dresden during World War II. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, was a prisoner of war held captive in an underground meat locker of a slaughter house, Slaughterhouse 5, that is.  In a reversal of fortune, his prison had become his salvation, delivering him from an apocalyptic scene of unimaginable destruction when the city of Dresden was almost obliterated from the earth. In the aftermath, his surviving captors forced him to perform the harrowing task of recovering and burning the bodies of the deceased. The book isn't written in chronological order. Instead, it jumps forward and backward in time, jarringly, to various periods in the main characters life including time spent with aliens on the planet Tralfamadore. Yes, aliens. Was the character abducted by aliens? Did he become unstuck in time? Or were these just coping mechanisms in the aftermath of war? Reading this book reminded me a little of someone who had experienced psychological trauma so severe that their personality split as a means to deal with reality. This condition, known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder) is a trauma-based disorder. Its interesting that PTSD, common among war veterans, is also a trauma based disorder, and considering Vonnegut was a war veteran my perception of the novel may not be far off the mark. Vonnegut himself described the book as so short and jumbled and jangledbecause there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. When youve experienced atrocities so unimaginable, its hard to make sense of anything and its easy to understand how Billy Pilgrim became unstuck in time and found refuge in another world. And so it goes Opening Line: All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. Memorable quotes: - Why me?  That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?  Yes.  Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.  And Lots wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human. So she was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes. Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Book</td><td>5.0</td><td>I think the book is in great condition.

There can be no doubt that General Marshall made extremely important contributions to World War II and these authors have given Marshall due credit. But these authors have gone further: Marshall despite being a critical wartime leader was no troop commander; the authors therefore had a difficult task of separating accomplishment as a manager from the accomplishments that the management made possible. If the book at times seems somewhat critical of Marshall, it could have been even more critical. But the authors successfully avoided the pitfalls of doing so. A manager, such as Marshall, was needed because of the complexity of the war and the sad military state that the United States entered the war with. Anything less than Marshall's managerial skills would have been disastrous for the Allies. But, by military standards, managers are criticized for not being leaders on the battlefield. Fortunately the authors recognized this and avoided the overt attempts to defame Marshall for this. At times, the book drags as the authors attempt to explain the political predicaments that Marshall was forced to endure. The authors point out that Marshall was apolitical: but this is hardly true. In order to survive in the realms that Marshall worked in, he had to have political acuity. In fact, his very appointment as Chief of Staff was a very political process which Marshall succeeded. Thus, thus authors, in my opinion, have overlooked and understated some facts in Marshall's life.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Great Statesmen</td><td>4.0</td><td>The book detailed not only the General's long and distinguished military career, but also his post WWII contributions as Secretary of State and later as the Secretary of Defense.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Read this book!</td><td>5.0</td><td>An absolutely wonderful book.

I was utterly convinced that I'd read it before, but I remembered really bizarre parts of it, such as Shadow being cold in Lakeside and the secret of the klunker on the lake. I even watched season 1 of the new television show (enjoying it immensely), and had myself convinced that I was thinking of an entirely different book. So I read it, and realized that I had read this before. I have no idea why my brain lost literally all the interesting things about it (a visit from Shadow, perhaps?), so I enjoyed this revisit. Since this book is much-beloved (though I will admit to not seeing the obsessive appeal) and has over 500k ratings on Goodreads, I'm not sure there's much I can add to the conversation around it. Having just watched the television show, I can comment on how brilliantly cast it is. I was completely unable to disconnect Ian McShane from Mr Wednesday as I read, and I was genuinely startled by every physical description of Shadow that did not match that of Ricky Whittle. I do appreciate some of the updates that have been made from the book to the show, based on era of storytelling. In 2001, the image of Technical Boy as a black trenchcoat-wearing, acne-scarred, overweight \"kid\" was entirely accurate. Today, an obnoxious hipster with a vape is even more appropriate. I can easily see myself re-reading this book for a third time (possibly after Shadow has removed all the interesting bits from my head again), but I'll definitely see if I can find an annotated version of some sort. Because so much of what's interesting about the gods in this novel are what Shadow doesn't know, and that's what I want to find out.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>my kid love it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>4.0</td><td>love these books</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>4.0</td><td>Great shape</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>A very good read.

One example of Manns thought-provoking observations involves the influence of the artist and concludes that the trust the public places in us is highly ridiculous, education of the young through art something that should be forbidden. Because how can someone be a good teacher when he has an inborn drive towards the abyss? My father, a highly respected high school and college teacher of art and art history disproves this conclusion.  In any case, if the novel contained more of these assertions, I might understand how it has attained a certain level of literary prominence, but there are three elements of this book that are difficult to understand: 1. The protagonists infatuation and obsession with young Tadziu defies comprehension even though the author devotes most of the book to this endeavor. 2. It is also difficult to understand how a novel about an esteemed author, which contains many reflections on his life and his art, contains only three brief sentences about his family.  There are not very many concise sentences in this novella, but the sentences about his family are three of them. 3. From the perspective of this reviewer, it is incomprehensible that this author won the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Easy reading.

The best known adaptations are Viscontis film in 1971 and the opera by Benjamin Britten in 1973. This book was also written at the end of Thomas Manns life and though it cannot really be said to be autobiographical, which anyway has no value to discuss and appreciate it, it is obvious that Thomas Mann has had that kind of experience first hand: becoming old, feeling death crawling and creeping behind the wings closer and closer, and attaching his dream of a second youth to the first youth one meets and sublimates into a fancy of beauty as an aesthetic dimension to cover up the deep psychological need to find a recipient for the mission of continuing the exploration of the world, mental and physical, intellectual and material, that one has done all along their life. This need, this desire, this quest is universal among all artists and intellectuals, maybe among all human beings as the survival instinct of the mind. It cannot be fulfilled genetically. It does not lead to anything hormonal which could be seen as unethical, and would have been seen as unethical in Thomas Manns time: it would have been pedophilic love, since Tadzio is hardly 15, probably less. It is symbolical, spiritual, mental maybe psychical. Apart from and beyond this personal existential remark, the book has tremendous qualities. The first one is its shortness. The subject  in a way it is an artistic testament  is treated in very few pages with very little action but always precisely stated and clearly described. No useless embellishment on the action itself. That enables the author to concentrate on the sole mind of the main character who is a successful German author who has preached all his life the separation of arts from life, from passion, from sentiments, from feelings. Arts are supposed to cultivate beauty in themselves and to look for beauty in the world. Gustav von Aschenbach is trapped by his own aesthetic ambition and practice when in his old age he meets with his eyes, and that will never be a meeting on any other level, and when his mind relays that vision into a deep reflection on what life is, what beauty is, what purity is. His eyes meet a young Polish youth that can be deemed to be 15 or less years old. The main character is attracted to this Knabe as he calls him in German, boy as is translated in English, visually, hence by the only vision of the boys body since he cannot understand Polish and that foreign language becomes some kind of music. The shape of the body, the proportions, the flexibility and articulations of that body that is fit without being athletic, still young and not wrapped up in too much muscle and fat. He is attracted by the face and the hair of this young teenager and at this level no one can describe the beauty of a face. Words can eventually describe the face but they cannot capture the beauty itself which is a very complex conglomerate of elements. The last attractive element is the light, very light indeed before the First World War, nudity of the young teenager since he is mostly on a beach in some bathing suit, which is a suit really. It only liberates or undress the arms and the legs from the knees down, maybe half thigh down. Visconti makes the boy bathe in the sea is some kind of swimming trunks that denude his body from the waist up. I am not sure at all that was standard in 1911. This first quality of the book is amplified tremendously by the Greek mythical references all along the pages. I am not going to list them all but systematically they refer to love (probably identified as identical to intercourse) that leads to death in a way or another. Some of these gods or semi-gods are messengers of death or have the power of saving someone who is close to death or dying, like Zeus taking Dionysus in his thigh, or Zeus against and others turning some victims of jealousy into stars and constellations. These references establish a full parallel between the main character and these victims of love and jealousy. But he goes one step further by referring to Socrates and Phaedo, particularly the death scene in Platos text, The Death Scene from the Phaedo, [...] The death of Socrates drinking his hemlock to which he had been sentenced is to be set in parallel with the death of Gustav von Aschenbach in the story. Note here how the name of the character is conveying the idea of death: a river of ashes. A close study of these references and their mapping in the story would show how symbolical they are. But let me give you one example of how the main characters wording of his approach of beauty is also symbolical and of what. The original for The happiness of writers is the thought that can be entirely emotion and the emotion that can be entirely thought, is Glck des Schriftstellers, der ganz Gedanke, der ganz Gefhl, das ganz Gedanke zu werden vermag. Apart from the fact that I find the translation less concise, less poetic and more abstract in its use of the generic plural writers or the generic philosophical  definite article in the thought or the emotion and even the happiness where Thomas Mann had used the adjective ganz to particularize what thought or emotion he was speaking of, the thought and the emotion that the author was constructing or experiencing right now, hence the necessary singular of Schriftsteller But the translation misses something more important: the symbolic music of the sentence. The first alliteration in /g/ seven times and the closing semi-alliteration in /w-v/ at the end bringing that seven to nine and the first alliteration in fact is one /g/ plus then alternating /ganz/ - /Gedanke/ - /ganz/ - /Gefhl/ - /ganz/ - /Gedanke/ which is a perfect Davids Star or number of Solomon, three adjectives-three nouns all carrying the same alliteration and alternating. It is obvious that the very deep and ancient wisdom of Solomon expanded into the seven days of the week of creation (6 days of work and one day of rest) or the seven days of the Holy Passion ending with the death and resurrection of Jesus in the last three days are turned into a diabolical reference to the Apocalypse, the Beast, the end of this world and life, and maybe salvation at Doomsday. The English translation is far from carrying that kind of symbolism. This novella should be analyzed from that original German version to understand how Thomas Mann is a symbolical mind that sees beauty in those patterns, Gestalten would be the German plural word, that are both the symbols and the expression of the mind and the conception of beauty it develops or constructs. If we take this novella as being in the tradition of symbolism in German arts we find out that the death of Venice is also the death of Gustav von Aschenbach, and this latter death does not enable him to actually transmit the mission of continuing his work to Tadzio. The transmission is expressed at the end in the last look but in the reverse order: it is Tadzio who becomes Hermes and by looking back at Gustav from the sea and locking his eyes onto Gustavs eyes takes him into the infinity of death and Gustav dies in his chair on the beach. Tadzio becomes the psychopomp of Gustav von Aschenbach into the immensity of space and death. That is a phenomenal vision of mental and sqpiritual survival and the failure that Thomas Mann wants to express as for Gustav von Aschenbach who just did not have the courage to confront and brave social conventions and norms and establish contact and communication with Tadzio. This contact, this communication with a younger character who becomes the surrogate of his own youth and the continuation of his own life after his own death was close at hand but he did not choose it, he did not have the courage of surviving intellectually, spiritually by committing his remaining years of life to a pure and spiritual friendship that is love without the hormonal side of things. But this reveals an important element in Thomas Mann German psyche: he cannot imagine any friendship of this type in his society because he would be convicted (in a court of justice if necessary) of improper behavior. Just think of Oscar Wilde. That sure is a masterpiece but its magnitude can only be captured in German. Just try to get it there:[...], many standards available.

I only say that i don't want to continue because somewhere along the line i was reading and not retaining. I got bored. This is a self thing i know but it happens. So this installment in my opinion was a little less on the violent side of things than the 1st one. However I thought that it would have been a teeny bit scary if I was a kid. In this book Simon comes back and he is not really a good guy anymore. He is set on destroying his sister, the extraordinary wizard and his baby brother. I get the way that Simon feels because I am the first child myself but I am pretty sure its kind of rude to go around using darke magyck to try and annihilate your siblings. Also Marcia isn't herself and its a little scary. Septimus from book 1 has grown so much and has learned more about himself which is great but he ends up going on an adventure to save his sister alone. Yes, he takes Nicko with him but they are kids!! So they get into a great amount of trouble trying to find Jenna and then also when they actually do find her. It was a little harrowing if you remember for a second that these are kids. So other than the obvious danger and potential death - this was fun. We learned a great many things.

His first stop was Trieste, which he detested, so, bathed in memories from his past, he sets off for Venice, a city the romantic qualities of which begin to set off the emotional explosion which becomes the soul of this magnificent novella. Gustav becomes fixated and obsessed with a 14 year old Polish boy, Tadizo, who is vacationing with his mother and sisters at the same hotel where he, Gustav, is staying....Over the course of the the second half of this tale, Gustav becomes ever more obsessed with the young man - an obsession which gradually takes such complete control of his entire life that every other dimension of his selfhood is completely and totally effaced. In the end, this is the story of the progressive domination and destruction of a personality built on one ideal (Apollonistic) that is totally taken down by the chaotic Dionysian forces and powers that inhabit us all. Nothing less than a masterpiece.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Done very nicely. My daughter used for her 1st grade project</td><td>5.0</td><td>Done very nicely.

Woven from the gossamer of mans futility, it is a web which, as the spiders, defines neither the meaning nor the escape from an existence he neither controls nor comprehends.  Individually and collectively, his novels are to be read as a sequence of  brief urgent messages with no beginnings, no ends, no suspense, no morals, no causes, no effects, butan image of life that is beautiful, surprising, and deep.  Vonnegut is, has been, and always will be inscribing a single punctuation mark - the period which ends historys apocalyptic sentence. To fully appreciate any Vonnegut novel it must be understood as one part of a continuum. Read Cats Cradle, the read Galapagos.  See the cat, see the cradle, see the island, see the hubris. Chronology matters.  The metaphors vary, but the template remains.  Cats Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five are best read in tandem.  Both tell his story  the fire bombing of Dresden, but you have to read Cats Cradle as anti-matter (fire is ice), Slaughterhouse-Five as matter (fire is fire).  See Slaughterhouse-Five as a photograph, Cats Cradle as the negative. After Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut promises to set all his characters free.  In Galapalagos, he resurrects a few, though with brand new names.  Read carefully, he retells the story of Cats Cradle,  - different metaphor, same theme. In both, Vonnegut telescopes historys kaleidoscope of apocalypse into a single surreal archetype,  macrocosm into microcosm.  In Galapalagos,  Vonnegut sets himself free, satirizing himself, his writing, his fans, thumbing his nose at you know who. Galapagos is a must tongue in cheek read for the Vonnegut aficiando.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Take Flyte</td><td>5.0</td><td>This book will make you feel like you want to fly.

For one, I thought postmodernist literature was just some yuppie terminology for a new writing trend. I didn't know that it was something I've been doing as an author all along. Granted, I found Billy Pilgrim's rambling narratives as annoying as those of Ray Bradbury's Montag in Fahrenheit 451 (which I'm now reading as well). It just goes to show what happens when you don't take time to stop and smell the roses on the cactus bush. Vonnegut's editors should have warned him that his 'time travel' gimmick with the Tralfamadorians was like running with scissors, and it ended up getting the story shot to spit. If he would have approached the Dresden holocaust with the reverence shown by Dalton Trumbo in Johnny Got His Gun, this could have been one of the greatest anti-war books ever written. Instead, we get these metaphors for hallucinatory flashbacks that, like the flying saucers, sailed right over the heads of most folk. Took me a whole decade to go back and look for this frisbee. Billy Pilgrim's Kafkaesque gift for understatement and depressive ennui make this a work of genius just as much as it can easily put off its audience. It's almost impossible to like this guy, but if you can hang in long enough to let Vonnegut show you what (or what doesn't) make him tick, this can turn into a compelling postmodernist read.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>I got bored with this one</td><td>2.0</td><td>I started the second book after reading the first one and was looking forward to it but could not stay interested in finishing it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Great but</td><td>5.0</td><td>The people opps the stupid PERSON gave the book a bad review because Amazon didn't work!*>_<*  not because the books bad it's awesome ^~_~^   p.s.  the BAD review is hopefully still a the bottom ^++^</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!</td><td>5.0</td><td>This book rocks!

The writer uses imagery from Greek mythology throughout the novella to describe his erotic infatuation with the boy. Ironically he actually begins to leave but uses a mix-up over lost and returned luggage as an excuse to stay at the resort and to continue to clandestinely adore the child.  Even when he discovers that Venice is undergoing an outbreak of a deadly strain of cholera, he decides to stay to be in sight of the boy.  He writes a philosophical page about aesthetics, how beauty allows humankind to comprehend truth and divinity. On the day the Polish family is packed and preparing to leave, he sees the boy one last time walking in the ocean.  The boy appears to to beckon to him, and the German writer falls out of his beach chair and dies. The entire narrative takes place in the mind of the writer and was for me a combination of a chaste version of Nabokov's Lolita and one of the half hour screenplays of Alfred Hitchcock Presents in the 1950's.  I read the novella in one sitting and thought to myself when the German expired, \"This is what Western sensibilities would be like if ancient Greek mores informed modern Western aesthetics and eroticism.\"</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>An excellent novel</td><td>5.0</td><td>Absolutely love this series and look forward to the next is amazing adventure series.

If you are looking for an interesting book but lack the time to sit down and read for awhile (kids, work or a spouse who likes to interrupt your reading time to \"help\" with things that must be done now for whatever reason) this book is for you.

Here is another work of literatre that does not engage me emotionally, but is fascinating as a work of art. Mann the author as well as the narrator seemed to desire the reader to maintain a critical distance from the main character rather than to identify and sympathize with him. Readers interested in a romantic experience, being wrapped up in the story, transported away from their mundane lives, and so on had probably better turn elsewhere. But readers willing or eager to work out a complicated allegory of the artist's quest for perfection will appreciate this cerebral work. I suppose I've said enough; I don't intend to summarize the plot and I'm not sure I can offer a very insightful interpretation of the allegory yet. I'm probably a couple readings away from being able to do that. It's enough for now to alert prospective readers that the bare plot is not the heart of the matter, that this story is really all about its symbolism and the intellectual experience you will have working it out rather than the emotional experience you will have identifying with the joys and pains of the characters: most people probably won't, and I'd like to relieve you of the obligation of trying to. If you do have a strong reaction, it probably won't be pleasant. Either way, you will get a lot more out of the work if you keep its intellectual project in mind. The one thing I can say is that the Norton Critical Edition is more than satisfactory for me. I might pick up another edition sometime; I'm interested in the introduction that so offended other readers. But the NCE comes with a few very nice little essays, so if you think you might read them I'd say it's worth the trouble to seek it out. Finally, I'd suggest reading The Magic Mountain first. Although it is at least ten times as long as Death in Venice, I think most readers will enjoy it more, and on more levels; regardless of enjoyment, I'd frankly argue that The Magic Mountain is a more complete work of art and a more important cultural and intellectual experience. That kind of comparison may not be welcome to some people: by all means, read both in either order and make up your own mind! However, if you're only going to read one, read TMM; and if you haven't liked DiV, read TMM nevertheless.

Night of the Jaguar is the final installment in a trilogy that began with Tropic of Night and Valley of Bones. Each of the three Gruber novels feature Jimmy Paz, a Miami police detective. In Night of the Jaguar, Paz has retired from the police department and works in his mother's Cuban restaurant. He has married psychologist Lorna Wise and is raising his young daughter. Miami businessmen are dying horrific deaths and the police are puzzled by the lack of clues (other than the huge, catlike footprints that appear at each murder). Paz is brought out of retirement to help the police solve the unsolvable crimes. With Paz's involvement in the murders, he and his daughter Amelia begin to dream about huge jungle cats. And as Paz begins his investigation, he discovers an Indian, Moie, newly arrived to the United States from an area of Colombia that the victims planned to develop. Moie is taken in by Jenny Simpson and her band of environmental activists, and Paz wants to know what his connection is to the murders. The more involved Paz becomes in the case, the closer the danger comes to him and his family. His own daughter's life could hang in the balance if he doesn't solve the murders. Armchair Interviews says: Night of the Jaguar is a fascinating look at the mystical and those who practice it. If you enjoy supernatural thrillers, you'll love Gruber's Night of the Jaguar.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>... the Berenstain Bear books and it was in extremely good condition.</td><td>5.0</td><td>My grandson loves the Berenstain Bear books and it was in extremely good condition.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Great Series</td><td>5.0</td><td>I loved this entire series.

Similarly to its two predecessors, it is a wonderful story, and a compulsive page-turner. It continues the story of Jimmy Paz' life, career(s), and loves. As before, Paz is a wonderfully rich and interesting character - a black Cuban ex-cop who now cooks for his mom's wonderful restaurant, and is father to a wonderfully engrossing little girl. Like the two previous Jimmy Paz novels, this one combines the multiple story lines of several very different - and very well-drawn - characters.  But it does these similar things in ways that make it completely unique from the other two novels in the series (so far...) Two of the major characters are a young, uneducated hippie girl, and a shaman from a small tribe in the depths of the rainforest. Gruber brings the reader right into the minds of these wildly various characters, giving  the thoughtful reader plenty of points of view of the same circumstances...

I love the books by Angie Sage and originally read this at a very young age. This caused me to not understand the plot, and I quit reading the series. Now at the age of 12, after I saw my friend reading it, I decided to give it another go. The books blew me away. So much detail, the characters are facinating. There are so many interesting characters in this story, including a long lost princess, a cat that was turned into a duck, a mother who has lost her seventh son, a mysterious boy from a army camp, a spy next door, and a malicious villian. The plot is well written, this is a good read for anyone who loved Harry Potter! I love how this story keeps you at the edge of your seat, and just as you think the character is safe, a new problem emerges. The names of the characters and things are unique and hard to forget, like Septimus, Beetle, Rhubarb lumps, Banana bears, and Marcia Overstrand. Anyone who loves fantasy would enjoy this book. There are dragons, ghosts, wizards, spirits, and of course, Magyk. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of seven, only because it is a bit hard to follow with all the characters if you are that young. Overall, I give this book a five star rating because it was a terrific read. I loved the characters, the suspense, and the plot. Once again, I highly recommend this to HARRY POTTER FANS.

It is an important achievement by any standard, the most significant of Kurt Vonnegut's work.  If a review is in order at this point in time (thirty-six years after its publication) it ought not deal with its merit, that's a given, but should address some aspect of the work that makes it relevant today. At a time when our country is war-logged, tired to death of the war in Afghanistan, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" reminds us of all that is wrong with depending on the military to sort out the world's problems. Billy Pilgrim, the hapless World War II Chaplin's Assistant whose experiences toward the end of the war are at the center of Vonnegut's tale, could not have been less suited for active duty. Separated from his unit virtually from the time he reached the front at the Battle of the Bulge, he never got his bearings and soon came to grief. Hurting, in way over his head, Pilgrim wanted to be left to die, but couldn't manage even that.  Roland Weary, a buddy, refused to leave him behind, and bullied him along.  When captured, Weary and Pilgrim were in such sad shape that their captors published photographs of them \"as heartening evidence of how miserably equipped the American Army often was.\"  Vonnegut, whose actual World War II service provided much of the raw material for the book, never lets the reader forget the reasons for his antiwar views. These become most clear in the account of the aftermath of the bombing raid on Dresden, the centerpiece of the book. In gross violation of the rules of war, the raid was designed to immolate Dresden's civilian population in the course of burning the city to the ground. Winston Churchill is said to have approved the raid because he wanted to deal with Stalin at the upcoming Yalta Conference from a position of strength. The fact that adverse weather conditions delayed the planned attack until after Yalta did not persuade Churchill to back off. The great old city of Dresden, a place of no military value, one which the Red Cross considered an open city, i.e.  one that would not be bombed, was wiped out. Billy Pilgrim was part of a small group of American prisoners who were housed (as Vonnegut had been) in a deep underground meat locker, Slaughterhouse-Five, away from the city center. It is where Pilgrim (and Vonnegut) spent the night of the bombing. \"There were sounds like giant footsteps above. . . . There was a fire-storm out there. Dresden was one big flame. The one flame ate everything organic, everything that would burn. . . . When the Americans and their guards did come out [the next day], the sky was black with smoke. The sun was an angry little pinhead. Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals. The stones were hot. Everybody else in the neighborhood was dead. So it goes.\" For practical purposes, this gut-wrenching account was for a great many Americans their first accurate look at what had happened to Dresden at the hands of our Eighth Air Force. \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" not only revealed the extent of the atrocity, it makes clear Vonnegut's contempt for our government's efforts to conceal it from us. As Vonnegut writes \"Even then [back in the days fairly soon after the War] I was supposedly writing a book about Dresden. It wasn't a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn't know that either. There hadn't been that much publicity.\" See the End Note. Vonnegut uses the phrase \"so it goes\" to emphasize the finality of death.  It appears at least 84 times in the book including the one quoted above. The editors of the 2009 Dial Press trade paper edition missed a great chance to use it to good purpose in the brief biographical note on the book's back cover. It ends: \"Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.\" If Vonnegut had been alive to compose that note, he would have added \"so it goes.\" End Note. Midway through Chapter 9 of \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" the narrator, alter ego for the author, states \"the thing was, though, there was almost nothing in the 27 volumes [of the \"Official History of the Army Air Force in World War Two\"] about the Dresden raid, even though it was a howling success.\" So true. The account of operations for the night of February13-14 simply says \"461 B17s are dispatched to hit the marshaling yard at Dresden (311).\" The number in parenthesis apparently refers to the number of targets destroyed in the marshaling yard-- a place where\"railway [cars] are shunted and made up into trains and where engines, carriages, etc. are kept when not in use.\" Contrast that with the account of operations in the Pacific on August 6, 1945: \"The world's first atomic attack takes place. . . . At 0915 hours (0815 hours Japan time) the atomic bomb is released over Hiroshima from 31,600 feet (9,632 meters), it explodes 50 seconds later. 80+% of the city's buildings are destroyed and over 71,000 people (Japanese figures say from 70,000 to 80,000) are killed.\"</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Interesting mix of several other fantasy books.</td><td>3.0</td><td>This was a similar fantasy as Harry Potter series books.

I'd read Cat's Cradle a couple years ago, and didn't care for it either. Vonnegut does have some creative ideas, such as in this case, the use of non-linear time.  He also makes good ethical points, such as the awful suffering and pointlessness of war.  You can tell he has had some creative thoughts, it just isn't enough. The main problem with his books is that they are so two dimensional.  Everthing is a list of what is happening, there is no insight into any of the characters.  One never really know why they did anything that they did.  Without this, there is no means for becoming vested in the story.  One does not care what happens to the characters, even the main ones.  If they die, they were only a detail in the book anyway, they were not real people. Also, he needs to stop saying \"so it goes\" so much.  A couple times may be \"poetic\", but a hundred times is repetitive and annoying.  Maybe he was trying to highlight the pointlessness of death, but there must be a better way of doing so. In the end, not the worst book I've read.  It was easy to read and flowed well.  I'd say possibly better for a younger crowd, such as high school.  I just never cared what happened and was glad when it was done.

Instead of fighting to exhonerate himself he should try to prove who truly killed this girl and then he will be found innocent but until then all he can do is muddy her name and  be disrespectful to her memory when nothing she did caused he to be murdered. The DNA evidence proves nothing accept he is an idiot and pulling at straws to sound good. He WILL ALWAYS live with this and never be free until they prove anyone else killed her which will never happen because the state of Texas feels they got their man in HIM.. It is really sad that if you look up her name and all you find is him..It is sad when the victim is forgotten in this.

It is almost equal parts anti-war novel and science fiction, and is thoroughly enjoyable. There's never a dull moment and there are some very interesting ideas to take away. Many of those ideas are conveyed by means of the Tralfamadorians, the aliens who abduct the book's main character. Yes, the book's main character, Billy Pilgrim, gets abducted by aliens and then proceeds to tell others about it. His daughter tries to get him to stop. But at one point in the future, others actually listen to Billy and believe him. Yes, Billy Pilgrim also travels in time. Unlike most sci-fi stories of time travel, in this case Billy has no control over when he time-travels and to what point in time he travels to. As a result, we learn about things which occurred well after World War II before we learn all the details of the war. It's a very interesting way of telling the story. The main focus of the World War II portion is the bombing of Dresden by the Allied forces late in the war. Billy Pilgrim was among prisoners of war who were being kept at Dresden when the bombing happened. The narrator of the story (who is not Billy himself) was also at Dresden. The attack is the centerpiece for illustrating how awful war is - a beautiful city transformed into a barren wasteland reminiscent of the surface of the moon. Much is also made of the condition of the soldiers on both sides, with many soldiers seemingly too young or too old for war and none able to remain healthy. Besides anti-war messages, some of the most interesting ideas are the result of Billy's time travel and abduction by the Tralfamadorians. The Tralfamadorians live in four dimensions and are able to see any moment in time all the time. According to them, you never really die, you just visit different moments of your life constantly (similar to Billy's time travel). As a result they don't believe in free will - whatever happens will happen and nobody can change it. One idea they propose that humans could learn from is that since life is full of good and bad moments, it is often best to focus on the good ones.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Slaughter House Five</td><td>3.0</td><td>It bounced off the walls a bit going from one subject area to the other.

This might be a odd book to read as a minister, but there was many connection points that were helpful.  In regards to the organization of a congregation, this book was a valuable resource.  The best insights from this book was the role of the business owner.  The business owner works the business, much in the same way that the minister works in the congregation.  This is why congregations that have a pastoral mindset stop growing at 200 members.  The minister cannot do anymore for the people.  He is maxed out.  The next step is that the minister works harder, helps the congregation grow, but than there is conflict.  He no longer can be at everything, people expect him at everything, and there are hurt feelings.  The same quality of service is no longer there.  Disappointment sets in.  People leave, and the congregation falls back to the normal size.  This book helps you think through these issues.  Instead of just working in the business, you need to work on the business.  This is probably the biggest shift for a preacher.  We are trained to work in, and not on.  One of the best steps for a successful business is building a system that can be duplicated.  This means understanding who is doing what.  If you do not have a flow chart, or an organizational chart, you have a mob, and mobs destroy things.  This is a good book for understanding how an organization works.  Everything might not line up with how a church works, but there is a lot of good advice, and a good read for the topic.

Although I found it to be a let down, I was still happy to have read this. Vonnegut provided many laughs throughout, and maybe if I was paying closer attention the whole way I would have gotten more out of this. The key message does seem to be to not fret about the petty things in life. Billy Pilgrim is a crusader when it comes to not letting things get under his skin, in fact, other people actually get upset with his insane ability to not give a hoot. With that being said, I'm sure this book does offer a lot of things to learn from, but overall, I was let down. Still, if you like time travel and space and World War II stories, check this book out.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Slaughterhouse Five review</td><td>5.0</td><td>Loved the style of writing The story confirmed my feelings about the stupidity of war.

Overall, I felt the book was enjoyable (if a little predictable at times) and will read Book 2 to see what happens to this delightful cast of characters. The characters really drive this story.  You feel for Silas and Sarah Heap, who are introduced as young parents and develop into parents who are struggling to keep their family together.  They have fostered a girl who came to them as a foundling infant, just as their seventh son was prounounced dead on the day he was born. The girl is kind and intelligent, and loves her family, so you see a lot of dynamics at work when the story begins to unfold.  All of the ancilliary characters are also interesting - Boy 412 grows in importance as the book goes on, and Nicko becomes a solid and dependable companion.  Aunt Zelda, Marcia, Alther, the rat...so many characters that keep the book interesting and help develop history and context for the story.  All in all, I think the author did a great job of tying together the history and multiple stories into one, through the use of her characters. Why did I subtract one star?  Well, I would have only subtracted 1/2 star if I could.  I did feel that the story began to plod a little in the middle.  There was enough information to work out some of the mysteries by then, but the story seemed to slow down, with all the characters remaining in the dark.  It picks up the pace again at the end, and has a touching \"big reveal\" that leaves you feeling satisfied that you stuck it out to the finish.  But I had my doubts, for a while.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Loved it</td><td>5.0</td><td>This was a book that carried me for a ride.

However, as Akkarian slowly tries to expose Sonea to the reasons behind his choices, Sonea begins to understand, and even agrees to help Akkarian. Sonea has to make some very difficult choices throughout this book, dissapointing Rothen and others she respects; and yet she never wavers. She is strong mentally and magically, and challenges the other magicians to see the truth that they ignore, and the consequenses on their actions.  I loved seeing the character development of Akkarian, and the easing of his cold facade.  He became my favorite charahter! The interaction between the two magicians during their journey together is rather amusing, and touching.  I was SO MAD at the ending of this book, and yet I also loved it. I don't know what the other reader who said there was no big BANG at the end was talking about, but I thought it had plenty of OMPFH!  I highly recommend this book, along with the previous BMT books.

Canavan answered all the questions she'd previously raised as well as some she presented in this final chapter. Sonea finally comes to understand the larger picture of the happenings in the kingdom of Kyralia. What is more she is able to make a positive contribution with her magic. Though Canavan used some elements that are as common as the Coke jingle to create her melody the song she composes is enjoyable. However some of the melody lines were a duplication of effort as several of the characters trace the same steps that Sonea takes at the beginning of the book. More positively, the book ends on its own note without the common final melody presented in so many stories. All in all, Canavan's \"The High Lord\" is an uplifting end to a symphony that began rather slowly.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Highly recommend!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I came to this author late...but I have not enjoyed a book this much in a long while.

It's an interesting, informative read. On that point, a book will only be helpful if it's interesting, otherwise the reader will give up. I've read and reviewed one or two which are like that here - they fit into that category. The E-Myth Revisited isn't one of those books. The author refers to using systems to make a business work. He's absolutely right about that. The reason why McDonald's and other successful franchises work is because they have a tried and proven formula - in other words, a system.  The point is that when starting a new business or revamping one that isn't working, putting in place a system on which everything runs like clockwork is the way to go. Good advice and this book is a good read, if a bit specialised.

What do they know that others don't? In this book, Gerber talks about the reason why most small business owners fail is not because of a lack of vision or their desire to achieve greatness but not taking care of the everyday things that rests in every nook and cranny in their business. They don't pay attention to the details and they don't work on their business. Gerber goes on to explain that the problem is not that these business owners don't work hard but that they are doing the wrong work. Every owner must have a clear understanding of what is going on in their business. Throughout this book you begin to get a clear understanding of what your role as a small business owner is and what it isn't.

It's clear why this book has become a classic. In one sense it breaks all the rules of writing and sets itself apart. The author has been true to his own vision and shows the reader the fluidity of the mind of a person who has endured shellshock and has post traumatic stress disorder -- the moving in and out of time in what appear to be alternately flashbacks (the war) and hallucinations (abduction by aliens). It further addresses the horror of the Allied bombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II -- to our shame. I told my grandson to imagine that someone had just knocked on the door and ordered him to go to war. How would he feel? That's the point of view of this book. A young man is conscripted and sent to war. What does he fear? How does he view the daily life of war? Because Kurt Vonnegut was himself a prisoner in the slaughterhouse converted into a prison, his writing is that more realistic about what he witnessed in Dresden through the eyes of his protagonist. Because of the slipping in and out of time, it can be a bit confusing, especially for a young reader, but one adapts to share this amazing journey of memories and discoveries.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Classic fiction</td><td>5.0</td><td>For years I have wanted to read this book, and I finally got around to it.

He focuses his narrator on one soldier, Billy Pilgrim, who happens to time travel and was abducted by aliens for display in a zoo on the planet Tralfamador.  Billy's time travel involves constantly slipping into different moments in his life.  One moment he will be a prisoner of war in Dresden, the next he will be a middle-aged optometrist, twenty years later, and after he will be back in the trenches, pre-capture.  This time travel is the basis for a non-linear narrative structure where the futility of the war is told in parallel with much other futility.  The time travel aspect makes Billy an observer of his life, not an actor.  (In consultation, the only other novel I could identify with a similar narrative structure is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Time-Traveler-s-Wife/dp/015602943X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>.)  Vonnegut, through all this, teaches the absurdity of war, but the novel is also crammed with trippy tributaries: For example, Billy Pilgrim reads a science fiction novel about a man who travels back in time to verify whether the Messiah actually died on the cross or not.  And in the zoo on Tralfamador, Pilgrim has a child with a Hollywood starlet. (This actually leads to the one inconsistency I found in the novel.  The Tralfamadorians teach that human reproduction, in ways we do not understand, relies not on only a man and a woman but also on the existence of gay men, elderly women, babies who have died, and others.  And yet, Billy and his Hollywood lover are able to reproduce on Tralfamador despite the fact that they are - as far as we know - the only humans on the planet.  Perhaps a minor inconsistency, but otherwise everything seems to make sense, in its way.) Vonnegut - zikhrono livrakha - fought in World War 2, so he knows some of what he speaks.  Ethan Hawke's reading of the audiobook is strong. Note on content: The book has strong language scattered throughout, and it has a number of references to sex although no graphic scenes.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>love this series</td><td>5.0</td><td>If you like rick riordan or jk rowling, this series is right up your alley <3 also if you are in a slightly higher age group ie 14+ gregory mcguire is another great option.

Unfortunately for me, because so much of the painting was about other characters, I became a little annoyed with what appeared to be non-essential ramblings.

It surprised me in the way it was able to grab me from the beginning. The characters were all interesting, and the world was fairly fresh as far as fantasy worlds go. There's actually not a lot else to say, as it's a fairly simple book. It is written for children, but it is enjoyable to adults (or at least this one). The plot had a little \"surprise,\" but I figured it out a while before. That didn't take any enjoyment out. One of my favorite things was being able to get narration from many creatures. From human to shield bug, you got to see a little bit of their world. It was fantastic! One somewhat bothersome thing had to do with the words themselves oddly enough. Any word that was related to magic was bold. That could take you out of the story a bit. However, I found that to be a minor thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun story in a fascinating world.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Okay but a bit passive for me</td><td>3.0</td><td>Ordinary Wizard Silas Heap discovers a baby girl while returning to his family home. With the loss of his own son (and under instructions from ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia), Heap brings the girl into his family and raises her. Times are tough, however, especially for wizards. The Queen has been assassinated and the city taken over by evil forces who are trying to wipe out wizards and raising an army of young boys to obey their every command. Although Silas tries to keep the girl a secret, eventually Jenna is discovered--as princess and legitimate heir to the thrown. Chased by an evil Hunter, Silas, Jenna, assorted Heap family members, Marcia and one of the young army soldiers Marcia has rescued make their escape. Marcia's magic can protect them to a certain extent, but the evil powers are strong--and soon Marcia is the ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard. Final control depends on getting Jenna and when Marcia is captured, it looks like the end. Author Angie Sage follows a familiar path in this fantasy and beginning of a series. The secret princess, the supposedly dead but surely still living (as the series is named after him) Septimus Heap, seventh son of a seventh son, the evil Hunter and magical overlord all call fairy tales to mind. In a book targeting younger readers, walking the familiar road isn't that much of a liability--after all, young readers like the assurance of the known and safe. For me, the bigger problem is that the action isn't driven by the protagonists at all. Jenna and Boy 412 huddle in a cottage in the swamp, waiting, while the evil forces plot (ineffectually). With Jenna and Boy 412 spending most of their time waiting (and Boy 412 only starts talking in the last few pages of the story), we're left with a messenger rat as the most sympathetic and active character--and he's used by the evil overlord. MAGYK isn't a bad book--it's competently written, with some funny description, an interesting character in Marcia, a tragic figure in 'the apprentice' and the kind of safe danger that young readers will resonate with. I don't think it's the kind of books that will create the cross-over appeal with adult readers the way the Harry Potter series did.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>An Instant Favorite</td><td>5.0</td><td>I originally purchased this book several years ago, but I found the plot too complex and the story too boring to continue reading, so I tossed it aside. So go figure when I want to try this book again I can't find my original copy. I bought the book again and it was completely worth it. While the writing was a bit slow and the plot dry in some areas, when I was finished I loved it and immediately bought the sequel. My favorite part is the way Angie Sage spells magic--Magyk. I read on her website that she got this from the old spelling of the word, when English writing didn't have many rules. I loved Marcia Overstrand especially, even more in the following books.

I am an adult fan of Harry Potter, particularly, and Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl, generally.  I like fantasy and read YA because sometimes the story is more  imaginative than books geared for adults.  Kids are great at suspending disbelief and great kids' authors know how to capture the imagination.  All that being said, this book was not Magykal to me.  It was not terrible by any means and I certainly did not hate it.  I thought it had some fun points and interesting characters (loved the Dragon Boat).  But I felt like I'd read the story before and could generally predict how things were going to turn out. I mean I knew who Boy 412 was about 5 minutes after he was introduced.  It was maddening that it took so long for his big reveal.  At any rate, this is probably fun for young kids but not, in my opinion, for teens or adults.

I loved the well-developed characters and story-line, but most of all, it was the way that the magyk was portrayed. The magyk in this book was completely different from the magic in Harry Potter, seeing that in Harry Potter the magic is something that people are picked for and then taught, but in Magyk the magyk came from objects that had spells written on them. It was very different, but a good different.   The only thing that I didn't like too much was that, even though you know who Septimus is during almost the entire book, it isn't until the very end that we find out for sure. It was somewhat aggravating. Also, I didn't like how the book switched from character to character.

Yes, he has some things that are not the same, but it would be nice if he was not the average mentor. I also wished that we could have seen the rest of the Heaps more in the Forest, because there's not much distinction.

The only parallels that I see are that it involves a boy, who at one point is an orphan, and magic. Definitely written for a younger audience, the Septimus books have a tendency to be a little silly sometimes and the endings easily resolved. However, in contrast, Sage deftly creates an interesting world with often odd and humorous characters who have the ability to surprise the reader. The plot structures of each story vary, and, to any fantasy reader's great joy, she doesn't use the same antagonist throughout every single book. Some of the characters switch sides, and other, new bad guys emerge as the series progresses. Also, unlike many series writers, Sage will start a chain of events that last throughout several books, continuing to hook readers from book to book. She does not wrap everything up neatly, but is still able to finish a book in a way that makes the story seem complete. Then, the reader has the anticipation of discovering how some of the issues that arise in earlier books will unravel in later additions. Within this book specifically is a prime example of a complicated plot structure and set of characters that break the far too often tread mold of fantasy novels. The main bad guy is a Queen named Etheldredda, who is now a ghost attempting to live forever. However, another `bad guy' of this book is her son, Marcellus Pye who kidnaps Septimus from 500 years in the past. However, in order to create three-dimensional characters, Marcellus is shown throughout the book to be kind and fiercely intelligent, winning Septimus's admiration and trust even though he doesn't want to be back in time. Far too often, the antagonists are simply evil and have nothing more to them. It certainly makes the reading more interesting when there are levels of good and evil, and not everyone has to be simply one or the other. Even Simon, who was the bad guy in the previous book, seems to be coming around because of Lucy's influence. I recommend this to all readers 9+, skewing more toward boys. -Lindsey Miller, [...]</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Excellent story line</td><td>5.0</td><td>Well written.

I spent a week in Cambodia before coming home in 1970. The novel I wanted to read most was Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. Being drafted for service in the American army was part of a global strategy maintained for superpower purposes, and the limited warfare I took part in with a few free fire zones and secret CIA armies in neighboring countries were minor matters compared to the idea that a real war would allow us to wipe out everything we hate. Opinion polls about fighting godless Commies used unpopular as a euphemism for what many people would not allow to be printed in newspapers. In introducing Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut asked some questions of the US Air Force that got a response covering the bombing of Dresden with secrecy. Cambodia had been bombed in ways that were not revealed when Nixon claimed in 1970: Up to this point, we have scrupulously respected the sanctity of international borders. Books seemed like the best way to turn war inside out. I have read many books that other people consider obscure because books reveal human aspects of behavior that are not what anybody thinks openly. Books that have been published after the death of an author can reveal what only a fool would admit. The goal of self-overcoming that Nietzsche tried to make a style of transvaluation of all values when he was preparing his last works digs much deeper than comedy into the way a mind can find paths in thinking that has become twisted because it is never the same time. Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. The entire history of religion, philosophy, anthropology, and any expectations of an end of the world have been hopping back and forth between such weird alternatives that the idea of a learning curve with a money mudslide wiping out society keeps hopping back and forth until nobody knows what shoe to expect on the other foot the next time around.

Galapagos, like most of Vonnegut's novels, is a tribute to the complexities and boundless horizons of human imagination. Here we have a boat full of humans, well not that many, cast adrift after the start of a huge, colossal, worldwide financial collapse, accompanied by a war and a million other social upheavals.  In the middle of it is the \"Cruise of the Century,\" originally to be a luxury cruise to the Galapagos Islands for a select few of the ostensibly rich and famous.  A middle class school teacher manages to make the list, evidence that anything is possible, and that is good. Somehow, in spite of his navigational ineptitude, the incompetent Ecuadorian captain manages to wash the boat ashore on one of the Galapagos Islands, which the school teacher, from her studies of Darwin's finches, correctly identifies, and where they are the progenitors of the new human race, which won't need \"big brains,\" or even hands for that matter.  Evolution will have perfected the human being into the body of a seal. Seals don't need much to survive.  Just eyes with which to hunt, sleek bodies to part the waters, flippers with which to hold raw fish, and mouths with which to feed.  Vonnegut points the way toward a simpler, sleeker, future, in which \"mankind\" has collective bad breath from catching and eating live fish. Full of all sorts of quotes, from all sorts of great people, but perhaps Vonnegut says it best.  This book is a testament to the great imagination and sense of humor that the late Kurt Vonnegut embodied.  Five Stars.

Forbidden Planet was the earliest science fiction movie I can recall.  I  saved Quaker Oats coupons to get a free ticket.  Succinctly the villain in the movie is the physical manifestations of the thoughts and fears of the characters in the movie.  In other  words, what they thought or feared became real.  American Gods are gods who have been created by their believers.  The old gods came from the old country.  The new gods are those created by what is currently worshipped such as technology or beauty.  The premise of the book is the conflict between the old gods and the new gods. Shadow is the main protagonist who is ignorant of his conceptional roots.  He is taciturn, large and strong.  He faces many changes and makes many strange friends.  Shadow finds himself being manipulated not only  by those he loves but some he doesn't even realize exists. The book questions the underpinnings of faith and what leads to worship.  The plot is intricate and occasionally confusing.  You often find yourself wondering where am I and what is Gaiman trying to say. The book is worth reading and if you are not a fan, I suggest continuing to read anyway as you may become a fan.  The book is a re-release possibly because it is now being produced as a TV series. I recommend the book.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Excellent</td><td>5.0</td><td>Billy Pilgrim, the main character of this story, was a soldier in World War 2, a time traveller, a visitor of a distant planet, a husband and, among other things, a proud father. He was also a living witness of the tragic bombing of the city of Dresden. What else could have happened to this man? A lot. And everything is told in an incredibly simple but profound way, full of irony and wisdom. The author shows he's a master in blending humor and tragedy, always paying deep respect for the victims of war's horrors.  So it goes.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>\"But brains back then were so big that they could actually deceive their owners.\"</td><td>5.0</td><td>The villain of the story is shared by all the human characters; their big brains. Big brains cause humans to pass their lives away conducting \"experiments with unlimited greed and ambition\" (p. 185). If all of Vonnegut's exaggerated characters, imaginative scenarios, and striking insights were peeled away, I think the fundamental question of the book is \"if our brains are so great how did they get us in so much trouble?\"  He acknowledges that the human brain created symphonies the mandarax (language transcriber that also provides appropriate quote for any occasion) but is it worth the cost of also creating war, poverty, psychopathology and torture? For Vonnegut, evolution has made a huge mistake and Mary Hepburn, a retired school teacher, is the heroine that can set humanity back on the right course. A course towards smaller brains and fingerless fins.  For Vonnegut, this convoluted approach to evolution is not without precedent in the wild... he points out the cormorants of the Galapagos Islands, who sacrificed flight for the getting of fish. Vonnegut moves the story along thanks to his manipulation of time. The reader is alternatively provided glimpses into the past, present and future and distant future. The bits and pieces are just enough to pique curiosity about how things will finish up. By the end of the book, past and future meet in a crescendo of revelations. Foreshadowing, thanks to Leon Trout, is actually 20-20 hind-sight. In typical Vonnegut style, narrator is capable of entering the story as he pleases. Not much is shared about Leon until the end of the story. However, without giving the ending away to any prospective readers, I would point out that my favorite part of the book is when Leon confronts his father about entering the \"blue tunnel.\" Other favorite parts included the quotes of the mandarax and Vonnegut's descriptions of various Galapagos inhabitants' idiosyncratic survival schemes. Leon Trout made this comment about the marine iguana's stew pot strategy: \"During the million years I have spent in these islands, the Law of Natural Selection has found no way to improve, or for that matter, worsen this particular survival scheme.\"  Similarly, Mary Hepburn points to the blue footed boobies mating dance as completely unrelated to any survival scheme. She then poses the question \"Dare we call it `religion?' As a guy that has read a whole lot of Kurt Vonnegut, my one knock against him is that, especially as he got older, he takes a pretty dismal stance on humanity. One of his earlier books, \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\" had a virtuous perspective of humanity and promotes philanthropy. The moral seemed to be of we could just care about everybody, even the average folk, then everything will be okay. In Galapagos, and his subsequent novels, such as \"Timequake\" and \"A Man Without a Country\" he comes across as a bitter curmudgeon. The stance that human race is a lost cause does not resonate with me. However, he tells a great a tale and makes you think along the way.

This is a well-written juvenile story about the life of the Heap family.  At birth, Septimus Heap is announced dead on arrival, and his father arrives home with a surprise - a baby girl, abandoned in the snow outside the walls of their city.  The Heaps, with 6 children already, welcome and raise the child as their own, although most are able to tell from her appearance that the child is different from her brothers.  Fast forward to ten years later, the girl, named Jenna, narrowly escapes an assassination attempt.  She finds out that she is the only child of a murdered queen, and must take the realm in hand to save it from the former Supreme Custodian (thought dead) - who has wrestled the position away from the current custodian because she is busy saving the princess from an assassination attempt.  Along this journey she picks up a few stragglers, namely Boy 412, who almost froze to death in the snow outside the magician's castle.  The characters are well-developed (IMO) and entertaining, although there are a lot of them.  There are a lot of journeys for the different characters and surprises and humor are included.

With its meandering storyline, beautiful asides, funny and cynical writing, and memorable characters, there's no way this could be written by anyone other than Vonnegut, and much of the joy of the book comes from just enjoying Vonnegut's style. That being said, Deadeye is also one of Vonnegut's weaker books. The introduction - in which he explains some of his thoughts behind the book and gives some information as to some of the book's symbolism - helps clarify things a bit, but the book never really coalesces much, ultimately just kind of feeling ramshackle and strung together. That's okay, really; Vonnegut has always felt like that, and no one can make that sort of journey more satisfying and enjoyable. And there's definitely no shortage of events here, between a narrator who's an accidental murderer, an exploding neutron bomb, a mysterious decapitation, a Nazi-adoring father, fake painters, and more. It just never really comes together in the end to anything more than a general lament for the slow slipping-away of life, and the lack of focus ultimately leaves you feeling a little disappointed in the book or like you missed the point of it all. So, yeah, it doesn't compare to his best works. But if you're a fan, you'll enjoy the ride here, minor book and all. It's still funny, still beautifully dry, still delightful, still moving - it's just not all that focused. But it's still a great journey to take.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Don't let this one turn you off from Vonnegut</td><td>2.0</td><td>I don't put books down very often, but I put this one down.

I feel that many of the reviewers have already captured the essence of this novel, but I also feel compelled to add to it..  after all, how can one not? Typically, I have not been a fan of science fiction/fantasy books, but let me assure those of you who have not yet read this due to its label, it is far beyond and separated from novels in such a genre.  I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut, but much to my present dismay, had distanced my literary choices from his work.  That has forever changed. \"Billy Pilgram\" has left an impression on me that I may not be able to properly describe.  He is painted to be such a simple and almost uneventful character, that you'd imagine this person to bore you to tears.  However, you will learn that his life is far from simplicity and holds the burdens of heartbreak, insanity (or perhaps, just an overactive imagination that bleeds into his human character?), tolerance of negativities, and nonchalanticity (if I may create a word here), that entices the reader to feel those emotions as if their own.  Billy Pilgram does not ever seem to be confused, regardless of his travels through time and the experiences he is driven to live.  He is comfortable with what he is presented with, most likely due to the fact that he learns about fate and its inevitability.  You'll find yourself questioning your previous interpretation on time, war, imagination/dreams, love... Although, coined into an anti-war mindset, it is not a novel that attempts to draw you into any specific stance.  That aspect alone, is masterfully done.  I wish authors of current affairs would be able to so delicately yet so simply describe their feelings without judgment, persuasion, or controversy. This tale will make you smile, laugh, frown, scratch your head..  The Works.  You'll be pulled into another planet, a war, a marriage...  and may come to the conclusion that time is what we make of it.  It's an entity that we both take for granted and still ponder upon what to do with it.  Fate, destiny, they are much larger than our ability to control, and often times, fighting it or attempting to counteract it, will only yield the same result in the end, after all.  And so it goes. ;-)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Good depiction of a journey</td><td>4.0</td><td>Plenty of observations as a mysterious man named Shadow travels around America.

History has decreed World War II a Noble Fight Against the Enemies of Civilization, but Vonnegut says it was a freezing firestorm that made a mockery of our very existence.  My late grandfather was also a WWII vet. He never read any Vonnegut that I'm aware of, but he spoke of the war in the same way. I think it had something to with actually being there. Both Vonnegut and my grandfather were grunts sent out to do a dirty goddamn job. Neither of them crowed about a minute of it ever after. That doesn't surprise me. What surprises me is that they both carried on with dignity the rest of their lives, when they'd both seen the beating black heart of the worst horrors man can render upon man. I've always doubted my ability to do the same, and remain thankful to this day that I've never had to find out. Vonnegut's anti-war screed has, if anything, only gained in prescience over time. (See Iraq, War in.) Makes you wish the Decider-in-Chief read books. At least this one. The strange advice (albeit dished out by aliens who see Time akin to a Rocky Mountain panorama) to ignore what's bad in order to focus on what's good smacks of the reasoning of a man who has reached the end of all reasoning. Who can no longer compose a rationale for man's behavior. The sort of conclusion you might come to, say, if you had survived the firebombing of Dresden. As literature, per se, Vonnegut's light-hearted dalliance with both the English language and the strictures of plot structure cause you to wonder why you spend any time reading books less fun than this. Then you realize that such an ephemeral style washes over you so quickly very little is left when the book is done, other than the sour taste of a moral lesson unwittingly learned. I suspect that was Vonnegut's very point. As a general rule, I loathe literature that attempts to teach me a lesson. But I'll make an exception for Slaughterhouse-Five. Oddly, among all the carnage and contempt, the scene that stood out most in my mind comes near the novel's beginning. The narrator is at an old war buddy's house to discuss plans for his war novel. Old war buddy's wife stomps angrily around the house. Turns out she thinks the narrator is going to write a book about John Wayne fighting the war, when in fact World War II, like all wars, was fought by children. The narrator assures her John Wayne will not be making an appearance in his book. Vonnegut dedicated the book to her. I originally read this in high school. Promptly forgot it. (Ah, youth.) I'm very glad to publicly rectify that oversight right here.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>best business book!!</td><td>5.0</td><td>I own my own photography business and have read dozens and dozens of business books.

No one could have anticipated what would happen. Many years later Madeleine does figure out the surprisingly painful truth. Her father Jack had been transferred back to Canada after having been posted in Germany which he, his beautiful Acadian wife Mimi, older son Mike and Madeleine, his old buddy had loved. Jack had history in Centralia: it was here he learned to fly, and then nearly died in a freak accident, ending his piloting career. At the time he was simply an angry young man but years later he realized the accident probably saved his life because he couldn't fly missions in WWII. Many of the pilots who did fly never made it home alive. MacDonald creates strong settings that feel familiar. The timing and pacing, i.e. Jack being seen in the phone booth by Boucher, the time when Jack waved to Ricky on that fateful day are amazing. The dialogue stands out because it is so normal and mediocre until you listen to the underlying nuances of what is said and NOT said, and what is heard and NOT heard. Innocence and guilt are major themes in The Way the Crow Flies. It seems the girls who remain in class after 3pm protect their parents alls right with our world innocence by not telling them about Mr. March. It definitely takes a village to raise a child but the adults on the base were nave about their childrens lives. Most were good, well-meaning parents but feeling safe and being pre-occupied with the minutia of life they didn't worry about their children. Claire, Grace and Ricky are all innocent but left unprotected. And then there are Jack and Simon. Both are smart and committed to the Canadian Air Force. But theyve been trained to be loyal cogs and do their jobs. (We all know who else were just doing their jobs during WWII!)  Pressured by Simon, Jack is forced to make difficult decisions which have a huge impact on him, the lives of his family and others. The novels main plot is where guilt comes in. What was the moral cost of ramping up the space program in Canada and the US with mass murderers?  The US invited nazi scientists in but didn't allow many Jews from Europe safe haven during the war when our government knew these Jews would face certain death!

And this masterful writing instantly creates a resonance with anyone who has ever rode out the last days of summer, wondered about making new friends, and settled in after (another) move.  But, like the best books with a murder at the core, this warm feeling is constantly interrupted, with the reader unable to stop wondering how this sense of place and time, and the idyllic will lead us to a corpse.  [WARNING: If you read the back of the book, it will actually spoil a major plot point.  I still don't know why backs of books are written so terribly!!) Also, like the best of them, you know, with an increasing sense of dread, that the characters you've instantly gotten to know, and care about, their lives will change when all is revealed.  When you are given your first clue about the identity of the victim, you exhale, not even realizing how much tension had built up and how so many little innocuous details had grown into suspicion and paranoia. There is enough amazing-ness captured here to make the book murderless---Froelich and Jack discussing the moon while Mimi sings an Acadian folk song in the background., Madeleine getting a ride on a motor scooter, or unpacking her toys.  But, with said murder, the tension builds, along with the head-shaking and denial when you find out increasingly horrible things in regards to people you have grown to care about to a great extent. The epilogue--when everyone has grown up, (epilogue longer than some novels, so let's say, the fourth act, could have easily have been a typically portrayed lesbian explaining why the Man has got her down.  Instead, every incident and word honestly stems and derives from experiences, memories and personality established in the beginning of the book.  Any fiction, where you feel the author is on a soapbox, can stem from character's words or action ineptly formed around the message that is being forced upon you. So, from MacDonald's' skilled pen comes not words, but life, as you, me, and the next person experienced it.  And any direction explored, anything \"alternative\" or rebellious, stems from real people trying to figure out them elves and the world around them, and how tragedy inexplicably tangles the mind, until we have the years, wisdom and strength to unravel it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Eye Opening</td><td>5.0</td><td>I've been in direct sales for over 15 years.

Still, it was an absorbing read, with a very unique style of writing that I really liked. I would definitely read more books by her, though I think it would be subject dependent because I liked the way she handled the young narrator much better than the older one.

MacDonald paints a convincing picture of life on a Canadian air force base at the height of the Cold War.  There is a depth and richness to this novel that will resonate with the reader for weeks after finishing it.  As a reader, the question becomes, is the story worthy of the time required to read 800 pages?

You could substitute \"quirky\" for weird if you want, because that's what \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is:  a very quirky, oddball adventure through time and space.  And it contains a valuable message if you decide to believe in the Tralfamadore view of things.  I rather like their perspective that because someone was alive at some point then they are ALWAYS living, at least somewhere.  (Though I suppose it's only comforting when you apply that to good people, because that definition also means that Hitler and other evildoers are always living somewhere too.) The novel begins with the author struggling to find a way to tell the story of his experience in World War II as a prisoner of war and witness to the firebombing of Dresden, which took more lives (at least immediately) than the atomic bomb.  He visits a friend and finally turns in a jumbled-up mess to the publisher. This jumbled-up mess is the story of Billy Pilgrim who is (or thinks he is) unstuck in time.  Because of this, his life is in shuffle mode, so to speak, where he randomly shifts from one point in time to another.  At one point he might be standing in a field in Germany during the war, at another he's talking to the Lions club in upstate New York, and at another he's a baby in his mother's arms.  Told chronologically, Billy enters the war near the end, gets captured, witnesses the bombing of Dresden, gets repatriated after the war, marries a large, rich woman named Valencia, has a couple kids, runs a successful optometry business, and gets taken to the Tralfamadore homeworld to be put in a zoo with a porn star.  Billy even sees how he is going to die. If the book were related chronologically and if Vonnegut didn't have such a way with language--his sentences lack poetic prose, but have the same quirky, seemingly random rhythm as the plot--then this book wouldn't have been nearly as interesting.  The way it's jumbled up forces the reader to keep putting the pieces together, although Vonnegut has a tendency to over-foreshadow some things like the teapot incident.  And the style makes reading a breeze because it's very relatable for the average vocabulary--no big words to confuse people. The only real flaw is the overuse of the expression \"so it goes\" to mark anytime a person, place, or thing dies.  Wikipedia's article on the book says there are 106 references.  It seemed like many more.  I understand what Vonnegut was going for, but it did get irritating before long. I should warn you, though, that even if the sentences are easy to read, you do need to be the type of reader who can put up with the quirky nature of the book to read it.  So it's not recommended to everyone.  If you're up to putting together a puzzle and like a little sci-fi with your literature, then you'll be fine.  Maybe you won't agree with Vonnegut and the Tralfamadore's view of the universe--maybe you like to believe in free will--but you should still be able to appreciate what a creative feat this book was and what a great author wrote it. That is all.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Loved this amazingly diverse novel.</td><td>5.0</td><td>they say books take you on a journey, and wow, this one surely did. from the beginning to end, this book is a truly wonderful journey. it's rich, and diverse with characters AND places -- an amazing road-trip of strangeness and charm through the American landscape.

He is typically impatient by any measure, so became, as many other of these reviews herein have noted, early irritated and exasperated.  Having finished the work, I can understand his point of view.  I sit calmly through the waiting lines of life, so came away with a different perspective.  If you can't focus easily, and are accustomed to (and prefer) the fast pace of life in current society and expect every writer to mirror that reality, then you will, as others have, complain about the pace of this work.  The author's pace is deliberately slow by design.  The work opens, like a flower.  Once you acclimate to the pace, the work becomes a comfortable place.   I had a French mother, and I was also molested as a child.  The author reflects those realities realistically and accurately.  One of the reasons the work may seem repetitive and tedious may very well be that between each act of molestation, the child's responses are carefully drawn.  The author has done a remarkable job depicting the mindset, psychology and mental language of a child.   The French phrases, far from being annoying, brought smiles of rememberance.  There are indeed some annacronysms in this work, but then, there were so many references she could hardly have had every one correct - KODAK is and was never spelled in mixed case, for example. (Ask anyone from Rochester!) The crow cameos, quotes, and poetry inserts were a nice touch.  In sum, she has written a fine work.

It's a good book, and is a 'compelling work of art,' but we're not talking Crime and Punishment here. The art of the book, I guess, is that Vonnegut created a fun to read (albeit bizarre) fatalistic world that somehow, in the midst of the sci-fi and light humor, portrays the horror of Dresden (but not with the force of a traditional straightforward delivery, in my view).  If read aloud, one senses that a dull monotone is appropriate.  The world of this book is fatalistic, ironic, and ultimately without point.  Like 'Groundhog Day,' reality is on an endless loop, and Billy Pilgrim glides in and out of the planes of time without control or pain.  I have to admit that I didn't really get all of the nonsense about aliens and time travel and all that, but I did see that Pilgrim is portrayed as (I think) the only human in the world who really understood what was going on, and everyone else was a tragic actor in a stupid and violent play.  For me, I could not get over-the-top gaga about the book - there is too much absurdity for that to happen.  And while it is not an endorsement of war, certainly, its message of anti-war is lost a bit in the clutter.  Give Vonnegut some leeway; he was probably stoned out of his mind while he wrote this.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look at other offerings from this author.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>\"We Exist in the Cracks at the Edges of Society...\"</td><td>4.0</td><td>Neil Gaiman's own introduction describes this book as: \"big and odd and meandering\" and in his postscript as: \"a thriller, and a murder mystery, and a romance, and a road trip.\" Suffice to say that you'll be getting a quite an eclectic mix of genres, tones, characters and themes when you crack open \"American Gods.\" Only days before his release from prison, introverted and taciturn Shadow gets the news that his wife Laura has died in a car accident. Numb with grief, he boards a plane heading for home, only to get a job offer from a man calling himself Mr Wednesday. The deal is simple: Shadow acts as a driver, bodyguard and gofer as Mr Wednesday goes about his mysterious business  what that might be isn't entirely clear, but Shadow is an observant man, and the puzzle pieces are gradually put together... I don't want to say too much more about the plot, as for a long time it's deliberately kept ambiguous as to what exactly Mr Wednesday is doing. Like Shadow, the reader can only pay attention as best she/he can, and appreciate all the sights and sounds that the fantasy road trip offers them. Along with completely original people and places, Gaiman also incorporates real American landmarks such as Rock City and the House on the Rock (though describes them in such a way that makes you question their existence!) To be honest, it took me a while to get into \"American Gods\". It starts off pretty slowly, and for the longest time you have no idea what's going on. There are chapters and passages that seem rather meaningless, and it's not until the book's halfway point that things start to make sense: characters' motivations become clear; disparate plot-lines start getting woven together. But one thing became clear as I made my way through the book  to enjoy the novel to its full extent you just HAVE to have a fairly thorough grasp of ancient mythology and the various pantheons of gods. Half the fun is getting a description of a new character's appearance, personality and traits, and figuring out which of the ancient gods they really are. (An old man with one eye? With an affinity for Wednesday? I know who this is!) Though Gaiman eventually identifies each god explicitly, that still won't mean much if you have no context for them. It's also jam-packed with other references, from Herodotus to The Beatles to obscure Scottish fairy tales collected by Joseph Jacobs. This is a book where Shadow can tell a raven to say: \"nevermore\" without any explanation, so expect a lot of sneaky allusions to go over your head, as I'm sure many of them did with me. As it happens, there are several editions of the novel floating around, and my recommendation is that you read the one published as \"the author's preferred text\". It contains about twelve thousand more words that the original edition, and comes with supplementary material such as reading group questions, an interview with the author, and \"The Monarch of the Glen\", a novella that details another of Shadow's adventures with the ancient gods. It's a deep and complex novel, one that's soon to be adapted for television, which was part of the impetus for me reading it in the first place. In many ways it's vintage Gaiman, specifically in his technique of updating old myths into contemporary settings, reforming them into something fresh but familiar. More than that, it's a story of America's identity, as explored by a (relatively) recent immigrant, and the thousands of contradictory components that make up its whole.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Very good book, loved it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>4.0</td><td>This one had a little too much history.

The setting is the Reconstruction Era. I like the fact that Oscar Dunn and Henry Adams are mentioned in this story. These were unknown heroes of the RE. It sent me scrambling to do research. Zahra aka the \"Butterfly\" during the Civil War was a spy for the Union soldiers. In a beginning scene, Zahra rescues Archer. I love the way Ms. Jenkins describes scenes in her stories. It makes the reader feel he/she is there. At times, I got disgusted with Archer. He almost allowed Zahra, the love of his life to get away. There are some erotic scenes in this book  since some of the action occurred  in a whorehouse. There are many humorous scenes. One of the funniest is when Zahra is disguised as an old woman and she eats at Archer's hotel. Even Archer is fooled. Sable and Zahra both laugh so much they have tears in their eyes. Then there is the earlier scene when the whores ride into town in a red coach. The character I disliked most was Wilma.

It was okay..</td><td>3.0</td><td>I've had an interest for awhile in reading this book by Kurt Vonnegut Slaughterhouse Five. I don't know exactly what drew me to this book but I think the title was a big part of it.. it just sounds like a really cool book.. This is the first book that I have read by Kurt Vonnegut and since he just passed away recently I thought there was no better time then to read something by him.. and I had Slaughterhouse Five on my shelf.. Slaughterhouse Five well what can I say.. Honestly I didn't really understand alot of this book.. not alot of it clicked.. it seemed like it was scattered all over the place to where it was very hard to follow exactly what was going on.. The whole idea that I picked up in this book is a mind that is unstable in the state of war.. it's hard to think clearly and be straight in a time when war breaks loose.. and maybe that was the intent on why it was written in this type of way.. so you can see what happens to the human mind when war occurs.. \"The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamodorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\" \"When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad conidition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments, Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians says about dead people, which is 'So it goes.'\" I'm pretty sure this is the type of book that needs to be reread in order to really sink it in.. and since I have just read it once.. maybe that's a reason why it just didn't do much for me.. And so it goes.. Justin</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Very Good</td><td>4.0</td><td>I enjoy historical romance novels, and I certainly enjoyed this one!

Yet I had never read anything by Vonnegut. With the advent of his death, I figured it was finally time. I enjoyed the book but am happy I saw the movie first. The story revolves around a man who does not live his life in a normal aging sequence but instead, thanks in part to some strange extraterrestrials,  lives by being \"unstuck in time;\" he jumps randomly from time period to time period. So, like the movie \"Pulp Fiction,\" we get a current event and go into the past to undertstand how he got there or we see the past and eventually it ties into the present. I believe the film captures the spirit of the book very well yet there are enough differences between the two for me to be very satisfied with both. The parts that differ from the movie really added to my enjoyment. The novel also alerts you to the fact that some of the action may have been taken directly from Vonnegut's life and the message Vonnegut was trying to get across is maybe a bit clearer than the movie can make it. Funny, I am not sure I would have enjoyed the book without seeing the movie. Why? Well, I am not a big fantasy/sci-fi reader so it is quite possible the subject would have been difficult for me to embrace. I am not sure I would have \"gotten it\" without the film to provide the framework. I could also visualize the characters and their predicaments with the film to fall back on. So my overall point is that this is a book you should enjoy immensely if you have seen the movie.  Of course, I can't tell you otherwise.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A very thematic and descriptive read</td><td>4.0</td><td>Gaiman always encapsulates the scenery of his epic stories so well.

Zahra takes great pride in her small contribution to the civil war efforts, but she's never forgotten one of the men she saved - Archer Le Veq.  The war is over but Zahra has been requested for a special mission - posing as the madam of a brothel in New Orleans. Archer Le Veq owns a prominent hotel in New Orleans.  During the war, he had worked for the Bureau of Military Information, collecting intelligence on the Confederacy.  Until he was captured and came close to losing his life, only to be rescued by a mysterious woman known only as the Butterfly. In the days following the war, the country is in a state of Reconstruction.  For many it's a time of rebuilding and hope.  For others, it's a time of a questionable future as they struggle to be accepted into society.  Zahra was content with her life in South Carolina.  She'd done her part to help her people during the war.  She had no intention of going back into the service of the country, but President Grant requested Zahra and promised to look into the situation involving her parents getting their land back.  Hoping the president would honor his word and help her parents, Zahra takes the assignment.  In order to collect information involving the perilous situations that people of color faced, Zahra will travel to New Orleans posing as the madam of a newly established brothel.  Nobody would suspect the proprietor of such an establishment of gathering information.  To protect her identity, Zahra wears a domino which only seems to entice the men, including Archer's brother, Phillipe.  Everybody wants to know the story behind the mysterious Madam Domino.  Archer fully intends to stay away from the house of ill-repute until circumstances bring them together and he finds himself just as enamored of Madam Domino as everyone else.  Unlike the others though, Archer has a feeling he's met her before, if he could only remember where . . . Beverly Jenkins WINDS OF THE STORM is an awesome tale.  You not only get a fabulous love story but you get further insight into the history behind the figures who struggled to help ensure every man, woman, and child of every race were treated equally.  Zahra is one of the most memorable characters I've ever encountered in a storyline.  She's strong willed, incredibly smart, and selfless.  Archer is everything Zahra needs in a man - virile, sexy, and he accepts her and the roles she plays in an effort to help their people.  There are other equally great characters in this story that do bear mentioning but that would make this review way too long.  I highly recommend this book. You'll want to meet the other great characters from this period in our history. This book is a follow up to Ms. Jenkins book THROUGH THE STORM.  I'm sincerely hoping there will be a third book involving Phillipe.  He's a dynamic character throughout the plot in this story who had me smiling with his antics.  This is a powerfully moving tale that has earned permanent spot on my keeper shelf.

When I first picked up Slaughterhouse Five I expected it to be like so many other standard \"this happened, then this happened, and so on\" books. After the first chapter though, I was hooked. The character of Billy Pilgrim is perfect in that he illustrates the carelessness we have about war. The aliens and their perspective about \"fate\" also gives into this concept that \"war is inevitable\" which Vonnegut is in fact arguing against. I don't want to give away to much, so I'll stop here on the substance. But beyond the \"meaning\" of the book the way it is written is also brilliant. The story goes back and forth and lets us see every moment in its full context. Also, Vonnegut does this clever tactic of bringing up seemingly small and irrelevant material in the course of reading the book only to bring it up again later in the book thus having you turn back the pages and ferociously look for the references. This is at the top-tier of American literature and deserves all the praise it has received over the years.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut</td><td>4.0</td><td>Slaughterhouse Five is not what I expected it to be... then again, in the first chapter, the author tells the readers exactly what to expect. Or at least an idea but even after being told the first and last sentence or two and the climax I wasn't prepared for what I got. Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Nothing happens. Let me correct that: people die, Billy Pilgrim (the main character) is abducted by aliens, he is part of the most horrendous bombing that took place in the second world war, and he becomes a common image on the TV. But none of it matters because none of it ever takes any precedence. A climax is impossible, a beginning and end are impossible for that matter. This book does not start or finish it is endless and rambling. Kurt Vonnegut is writing of Billy Pilgrim, a man that has become \"unstuck in time\". This means that he travels to the future and the past, although that statement isn't entirely correct. All moments coexist universally, thus there is no possibility for a future and a past. The problem is describing the book means to enter into the book's world, which is impossible if you don't know what that world is: paradox. The book supplied me with a lot of thought. My mind was always screwing itself up in reading it. The book makes you trip over the guidelines you lay out to understand it. I realize that much more powerfully in describing it now. The peculiarity and tendency to perplex however does not make it a bad book, it's very good on the other hand. Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five brought up interesting issues although what it brought up is not what it's famous for in my opinion. They say it's an anti-war novel but I would say it's more like an anti-human mind novel. Oddly enough it says to us that humanity has no control whatsoever over what happens but it also says that there is nothing else that is in control but just what exists. What exists is there and is unalterable. Everything is laid out carefully, a perfect law that appears to be extreme chaos. I don't necessarily agree with all that Kurt Vonnegut brings up in this famous novel but I do admit that I enjoyed the book for bringing these things up. I felt a new perspective stated clearly and without baggage. I could read this book without applying a philosophical label to it. All in all Slaughterhouse Five is a good discussion novel. It's great for its themes and the conversation that I'm sure will come out of it. The book though well written has very little to it without its ideas though. I would suggest it but only if you leave time for discussion and debate afterwards.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>E-Myth</td><td>5.0</td><td>For me this book was like a light bulb switching on.

The best way, he says, to think of this is to imagine if you had to \"franchise\" your business. Is the way you're doing things systematic enough that it can be replicated all over the country? In reality, of course, the odds that you WILL franchise your business are negligible, but the same method of thinking will allow you to: ...expand your business to include more employees ...allow you to go on VACATION with a free and easy conscience ....allow someone else to pick up the slack if you fall ill. There are some other good points in here (the value of consistency, etc.) A definite must read for the small business owner.

Mr. Gerber downplays this idea, just referring to it sporadically through out the book, and yet I now realize that these values are what makes the systematization come alive.

There, he witnesses the horrible firebombing of the city by Allied forces.  Eventually he returns home and marries and takes over the family optometry business. A secondary stream flows underneath this basic story.  Billy Pilgrim is purportedly able to travel through time.  He is also abducted by aliens and kept in their zoo with a young starlet as his \"mate\". Vonnegut's prose is simple, clear, and powerful.  It is all plain English, and he doesn't make any effort to dress up the story with anything pretensions.  Reading his work is refreshing because he never talks down to the reader, he just tells the story.  (In this sense, he is a lot like Nabokov but with a smidgen less zest.) Delve deeper into the meaning of the story, though, and you will find that the story is as deep as you want to go.  Billy Pilgrim is obviously \"shell-shocked\" and suffering internally, though from all outward appearances he seems to be fine.  In his own mind he thinks himself fine, though his frequent flashbacks to his past and his imaginary alien abduction tell otherwise.  So what exactly is going on with Billy? If all this is happening to Billy, what is Vonnegut trying to say?  What are the demons that haunt him, the author?  Vonnegut, too, was at the Dresden firebombing, and in a very real sense this book is his attempt at self-therapy.  How much of Vonnegut is reflected in Billy? The aliens are presented not as time travelers, but as beings that simply \"are\".  They, as well as Billy, see time as a solid mass which can be examined in any order.  Therefore, to them, wars are inevitable, as too are happy times.  The key, they tell Billy, is to look at the happy times rather than dwell on the sad times.  However, the realness of the aliens is certainly in doubt.  Perhaps Billy created the aliens, or picked up the idea from a book, in order to help him cope with his internal pain. The book has a strong anti-war message, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it.  The most repeated phrase is \"So it goes\" which is a way to accept a preordained fate as it comes, but perhaps we don't have to accept that fate is preordained, that we have free-will to choose our fate.  The aliens would scoff at this, but if Vonnegut meant for this to be an anti-war novel, then he must believe that we can control our fate enough to avoid war. The book is a great read.  It is easy enough for young students and meaningful enough for older folks.  5 stars, easily.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Cat Breaking Free</td><td>5.0</td><td>I have to say I absolutely enjoyed this book.

Its basic proposition is that the key to real prosperity in business is to work on your enterprise, not in it. In another words, the book aims to be a lifeline to those stuck in the quagmire. The book is a recipe for putting your self back in control of your working hours - in short, to be able to work on your business, not in it. The distinct Gerber's message is that if your business is to thrive, it will engage you in a process of constant personal development. For it to change, you have to change too. In order to do this, you must have written goals. As Watson put it:\" Everyday at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business\". Finally, the success of this book coincides with the boom in business franchising, in what Gerber called \"turnkey revolution\". Franchising has a system (eg Mc Donald) which epitomises speed, orderliness and simplicity. This is another way of saying that the key to real prosperity in business is to work on your business, not in it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Funny Morbid Poignant Bizarre</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is my favorite Vonnegut so far.

One error keeps appearing in other reviews here that for some reason is bothering me.  Billy's trip to Tralfamadore did NOT teach him how to travel in time, and he did NOT travel at will.  On the first page of Chapter 2: \"Billy is spastic in time, has no control over where he is going next, and the trips aren't necessarily fun.\"  Later in the same chapter: \"The Tralfamadorians didn't have anything to do with his coming unstuck.  They were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on.\" Thank you for listening, and enjoy the book.  One other thing: Chapter 1 may put you off and seem boring.

I love the interactions between the cats, and that Joe Grey has a delightful sense of humor. Shirley Murphy answers the question many of us ponder - \"If our pets could talk, what would they say?\" Her plots are interesting and never recycled. I highly recommend this series to any one who loves cat mysteries, or is looking for a good book to curl up with on a rainy day.

This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes. The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes. Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes. Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \"The Destruction of Dresdon\". So it goes. Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life. So it goes.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A firestorm of humor</td><td>5.0</td><td>The bombing of Dresden is what Slaughterhouse 5 is really about.

A comment which is true, this is not a big book, just over 150 pages, but even with that Dresden remains a presence. Something inevitable and dark, which can't be shifted, and reflects throughout the real tragedy that is Billy Pilgrim's life. Even if he manages to shrug everything else off, we the reader are left with the effect of Vonnegut's story.

I will say right from the start that YES ITS SIMPLIFIED, NO ITS NOT THAT EASY, but thats exactly what makes this a great book.  I read the critics' reviews and they seem to be basing their entire opinion of this man's teachings off of one book.  If it were physically possible to fit enough information in one paperback book  to run a business, then running a business would not be difficult at all. But no, this is not a how-to manual or a solve-all method, this is the beginning of a process.  Gerber introduces us to the three personalities of a entrepreneur (technician, manager, and entrepreneur or visionary) and discusses how most small businesses face a similar problem and that is letting the technician take over the business and killing off the other two. He discusses how the greatest one-time small businesses in the world have overcome that obstacle.  He does this mainly through praising the franchise system.  In this way I consider this book also on economics- explaining a little bit how small businesses' affect world economy. The franchise system allows all personalities to excel, and when they excel the customer is better served and better satisfied.  The system works.  So managers and technicians can have a business that will be successful and they will be fulfilled working on.  But it does not stop there.  He also teaches that entrepreneurs must create their small businesses according to a \"franchise prototype,\" basically set-up systems and operations so the business can work most effectively (like as if they were to sell it, even if they don't plan to). When you set-up you business as something you could sell if you wanted to, then you are creating a business of value.  When you do that, then you can be most successful and fulfilled.  What is the point in going into business if after 5 years you've only created more work for yourself and nothing to show for it? In the book's simple story-telling format, Gerber travels with his protege (and the reader) and walks her through the mindset.  In order to go from unsuccessful to wildly successful- your mindset has to be the first thing to change.  (Read the \"one star\" reviews to see the effects of a closed mind). This book reminds me of the simplicity of \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" and its philosophical take on business.  No, its not a well-laid out instruction manual, thats your job to create a manual.  This book will inspire you to do more than you have previously thought possible.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Insightful. Revealing. Clear-Sighted. Inspiring.</td><td>5.0</td><td>THE E_MYTH REVISITED is worth reading and revisiting. Gerber reminds the reader about the basic premise of business: satisfying the customer, in a new, entertaining, and insightful way. He proposes that the three key characteristics (skills) of a successful business owner are: skilled technician, entrepeneur, and manager. This is sound advise and a proper balance of the three prevents tyranny by any one personality. I have seen exagerations of all three of these skill sets to the ruin of the afflicted enterprises; mine included. As a case study, he follows Sarah, owner of All About Pies, as he leads her through her catharsis from exhausted technician to balanced, productive and fulfilled business owner. There is a great deal of truth that Gerber captures and teaches along with room for some disagreement. Not every business, for example, is suited to be franchised. Not every service can easily be documented. Nonetheless, this quick read is worth its weight in gold to the young or new businessman.

Dealing with both personal experiences, fiction and introducing himself as a character, the writer has created a unique work that will remain in the literary cannon forever. It is hard to tell what this novel is about, because it is sometimes funny, sometimes a sci-fiction, and sometimes very very sad. By using such device, Vonnegut shows the reader the absurdity of the war and of the 20 century as well. Death and life are side by side in his words. At the same time, the novel is a personal journey towards the center of himself. Using a fragmented prose only enhances the experience of reading this novel. With such technique, the book requires more attention from the reader, and increases the curiosity of what will happen next, and when this part of the narrative will be resumed. This is one reason why many readers find Vonnegut's work stranger than the average writer. So he is, but in a good way. This elliptic narrative is very sophisticated and beautiful to those who read a book and care about language, character development and plot. Vonnegut's sense of humor and sarcasm are brilliant turning what could be a tacky story into a deep work, filled with undertones and, psychological and political ideas. The constant use of the sentence `So it goes' display a high level of sophistication, that many veteran writers will never acquire. All in all, `Slaughterhouse-Five' is an important read for everyone who is interested in good and profound books. Those works that make us care more about the world we live, the society we are building everyday and, above all, the life we are leading.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Insights</td><td>4.0</td><td>a few good insights, a lot of repetition, some discipline required.

However, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is certainly the best of what I've read of him, and unlike some of his other books (\"Breakfast of Champions,\" for instance) holds up well to multiple readings. \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is typical Vonnegut in many ways, but it works better than the majority of his novels due to an emotional element that is usually lacking.  I felt for Billy Pigrim as a person and really cared whether or not he was able to pick up the pieces of his life and recover from the hell-on-earth atmosphere of World War II.  One scene stands out clearly in my mind---Billy at the window of a factory that manufactures (maple syrup I think?  Anyway, something sweet) and crying as he licks a spoon---crying because of the utter simplicity and unqualified pleasure something like maple syrup can give him.  It's as if the intensity of the horror he experiences during the fire-storming of Dresden increases the intensity of all other experiences as well, so that for this one moment, his whole world has come down to the taste of maple syrup on a spoon.  Wow, what a great scene. This novel inevitably gets compared to \"Catch-22\" because of its subject matter and quirky tone, but really the two books aren't very similar.  I like \"Catch-22\" better, but would still recommend \"Slaughterhouse-Five.\"</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Oof, oof</td><td>5.0</td><td>Sometimes I say, Oof.

I had no choice but to keep reading, and when I was done, I was done. I had to take a breather before moving on to something else. (Okay, a twenty-minute breather.) But the exhaustion American Gods left in its wake is the best kind. Its the exhaustion of a book that made you think and swept you off your feet with its writing, characters, and story. Not a bad problem to have. You wouldnt think a big, muscly convict would have a name like Shadow. But when Shadow was a kid, he was shy and bookish, and hes still got a little of that left in him. Once he gets out of prison, all he wants to do is see his wife, take a bath, get a good job, and forget the whole thing ever happened. But a few days before Shadow is released, his wife and future employer are both killed in a car crash, and a strange man with a glass eye shows up, offering Shadow a job to work for him. Shadow doesnt know what exactly hell be doing, but hes desperate. So he says yes. Little does he know that hes working for an honest-to-goodness god  or that every god that has ever been brought through immigrants to America is living somewhere in the country. Their existence has been rough at best, but a new schism threatens all of them. And Shadow, who only wanted a hot bath, is trapped in the middle of it. American Gods is challenging in a number of ways. Its over five hundred pages long. Its plot is often vague and jumps around at what seem like inconvenient times. Its an American epic by a Brit. And, of course, the idea that all these gods are real at the same time takes some getting used to, even if you grew up with Rick Riordan. But all those elements that make the book challenging actually strengthen it. All the gods being real means that no particular religion is knocked; I, as a Christian, did some deep thinking about my faith as a result of reading American Gods, but I didn't feel like Neil Gaiman was dissing it. I personally did not notice Gaimans Britness at all. And the length and the plot are never too much. There are occasional snapshots of early American life and the gods/creatures people of those eras followed, and though I understand why people would be annoyed by them, I was fascinated. The several chapters Shadow spends in a small Michigan town are fabulous; you expect to be bored when theres no supernatural stuff going on, and you're not in the least. Theres a reason so many American authors set their stories in the middle of nowhere, after all. This is in many ways an outrageous book, and its not for the faint of heart or the very young.

Well, since I liked the first book so much, I'm going to give this book the benefit of the doubt. The mystery involves the murder of an elderly beloved movie star, and the additional finding of buried children's bones.  Once again the antics of the feline \"talkers\" found clues that they relayed to the police by phone as 'unknown snitches' which lead to finding clues to these intertwined murders.

Lots of fluff.</td><td>3.0</td><td>This book has a high rating because it really does contain a couple very powerful ideas for the small business owner. My problem with this book is that those ideas could be presented in about 4 or 5 chapters, maximum. A fair portion of the 18 chapters of this book is pure fluff. Especially toward the end, where some of the chapters were complete zeroes. I suppose the author had to pad it out for the publisher to make it look like a serious business book. Furthermore, this author has what I'd call a high word-to-data ratio. I've read few books where so many words are used to say so little. Probably worth reading for the good ideas contained, but be prepared to be frustrated by all the gloss you have to wade through.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Small biz aid</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great stuff and a must have - appears to be simplistic but after you really study Gerber's well articulated strategy carefully - it will then reveal its true value.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A book that defies categories</td><td>5.0</td><td>An amazing journey of a book that can (and should) be read on so many levels.

The E-Myth was recommended to me a decade ago by a very successful advertizing executive on a flight from Seattle into LA and then on his way to scuba dive the Barrier Reef for a month. The E-Myth provides the best way to view the various aspects of \"getting there\" and has even helped me in my work at the large commercial aircraft company I work for. It helped me through years of working my own side business and the recent E-Myth Manager book made me realize its time to go back to grad school (which is where I am now). Amazingly on one level Gerber's books are the best \"self help books out there\" I feel sorry for all the readers who didn't buy the book because of Hupalo's or other negative reviews.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Granddaughters enjoyed the book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>loved it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Not for everyone, but if you liked kerouac and Vonnegut, it is worth a read.</td><td>4.0</td><td>It is somewhat like a mix of Kerouac meets Vonnegut...with a pinch of Pynchon thrown in which is not a bad mixture in my book.

Tolan. The book is realistic fiction. If this book were a movie, it would be rated PG. I would give Listen a rating of 4.5 stars. In this book 12-year-old Charley is recovering from an accident that shattered her leg, but that is not as hard as facing the loneliness of a summer without friends and a father who does nothing but work. During the summer Charley finds a mysterious dog across the lake. Charley must bond with the dog in the woods that her mother loved. Three things that I enjoyed about this book were that it had a dog in it, it showed love and compassion for animals, and it's in the perspective of Charley.  The writing style in this story is in the 3rd person. Stephanie S. Tolan always said Charley not I. For example: \"Charley is running along a twilight road between towering trees, chasing a figure that she can barely make out ahead of her.\" I would recommend this book to anyone who likes dogs or animals because Coyote is a dog and an animal and he is the main part of the book Listen. I don't think there is anything that should be changed in this book because it is great the way it is.

It would be similar to calling \"Beowolf\" a poem or \"Dr. Strangelove\" a black comedy. It is a truthful assesment, it just doesn't do the work justice. Slaughterhouse is a brilliant satire/black comedy of not just war and science-fiction, but humanity, love, death, friendship, and any other ideals that we as a race hold dear. It is this that causes the biggest problem with Vonnegut's appreciation by mass audiences, \"How can he make fun of that?\" Simple, he just brings in a space-craft. My favorite character of not only Slaughterhouse, but all of Vonnegut's collective work is by far and away Kilgore Trout. The essential paperback writer, and perhaps an insight to what might have been with Vonnegut (consider what would have happened to him had his work been released at a less tolerable time-period during the history of American Literature and you will see what I mean) Trout is a pat on the back for any independent artist, regardless of the genre, that the effect your work has on a small group is not lessened by the size of your audience, but, instead, confirmed by the reaction of the few. He is also hilarious and brilliant. Other then Trout, however, the story revolves around the life of Billy Pilgram. Not the life as you or I, or a lesser writer even would see it, but as according to the view of Tralfamadorians, an alien race who has a greater understanding of the view-point of time then humans ever will. So it is through their eyes that we witness the fascinating life of Pilgrim. From his days in captivity by the German army during World War II leading up to the fire-bombing of Dresden, to his abduction by aliens and use as a museum piece as he \"mates\" with porn-star Montana Wildhack, through marriage, plane crashes, insanity, and death we not only watch his fascinating life, but find ourselves laughing at our own ridiculous society. If you enjoy satire, black comedy, and poking fun of all that you hold dear, then Slaughterhouse is defenitely for you. If not... then read it anyway.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>4.0</td><td>Lots of great tips</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>I don't really agree with this book.</td><td>3.0</td><td>I don't agree with this book because I don't believe that the mob did her.

That soulless horrific unstoppable force that rolls on forever destroying everything in its path. Billy Pilgrim is described as a bee in amber who can do nothing but exist in a world he cannot control (This metaphor can of course be extended the entire human race.)  Vonnegut uses the aliens and Billy Pilgrim's time travel to show the futility of trying to stop war.  The aliens while they know all about war and even the destruction of the universe do nothing to stop it because it is just the way of things. So it goes. This phrase used throughout the book seems to say what difference does it really make we are all going to die anyway.  Also especially interesting is the time travel for instance at one point Billy Pilgrim sees a bombing in reverse order.  He sees the planes take back the bombs and stop the fires, he sees the bombs being disassembled, and finally he sees the raw materials hidden into the mountain where they can't hurt anyone anymore. So it goes. The irony that permeates Billy's experiences is not only dogmatic but also well developed in this classic work of fiction.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Amazing, dreamlike adventure past the dark depths of realism</td><td>5.0</td><td>One of the trippiest and most surreal books I've ever read, in all the best ways possible.

Vonnegut's quirkiness, wit, and humanity are honed to perfect pitch in this story of the complacent Billy Pilgrim's random and unhinged journey through time, from the firebombing of Dresden in 1945 (\"I was there too.  Me.  The author of this book.\") to his life as an optometrist in Ilium, NY (that is, Schenectady) in the 1960's. But why should I say anything?  This is a unique novel, a great, moving read, & a quick one too--you can read it in one sitting if you want to (I think I did it in 2 or 3 over one weekend).

Also I am not an environmentalist so the overall theme of the book \"Humans will destroy the Earth if we don't do something\" didn't touch me.  The only character in the book who is compelling is the headless son of Kilgore Trout.  His roll is the events is so passive that you can't \"root\" for him.

THE BOTTOM LINE: Parents are constantly on the lookout for a new children's book for their kids' shelf that takes language, art and some sort of lesson and incorporates all those elements in a nice package: this one fits the order. MY REVIEW: THE GOOD: Every now and then parents come across a children's book that leaves the entire family in a euphoric state. Since it happened to most current parents when they were younger and their parents opened up and read \" Green Eggs And Ham\", now they're on the prowl for more books to fit their kids' bookshelves. Unfortunately we come across a lot of dusty dud-tomes in our book hunt but every now and then we get a gem that has our three year old staring, our six year old smiling and the parents enjoying the read. This book does all that. The author uses cookies (and so many things related to cookies) to teach words and simultaneously share some (very funny) life lessons such as: \"Trustworthy means, if you ask me to hold your cookie until you come back, when you come back, I will still be holding your cookie.\" This would be great in itself, but Jane Dyer goes above and beyond with her lifelike illustrations with almost a nod to Norman Rockwell with their detailed beauty by showing on that \"Trustworthy\" page the little girl, holding and staring at a cookie and biting the side of her lip. You can't beat that. Definitely a great read that'll leave parents wanting more pages and kids wanting a reread with cookies, please. THE BAD: I wish there were more pages? There was nothing bad. Well, except maybe the desire for some kids to want cookies. THE UGLY: Nothing ugly about this book. Printed on nice paper, the cover is a nice stock and the illustration is repeated on the hardcover. Even the inside flaps are an enjoyable read highlighting words like \"SHAMELESS\" when it comes to the author (you can check out Amy Krouse Rosenthal's site here) plugging her own work and \"ILLUSTRIOUS\" as defined with the illustrator's name (Jane Dyer).</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Excellent!</td><td>5.0</td><td>We bought this for our 20 month old.

I think the reviewer who lauded the book and described it as not one story, but many, was probably the most helpful to me to understand what it is that I missed. I enjoyed reading the book, but it was easy for me to put down. There were segments, like the time spent in the more or less real world while Shadow was in Wisconsin, that I enjoyed, but the scenes with the gods in their various forms left me confused. I will chalk that up to my ignorance of the gods and mythology and my lack of interest in the fantasy world that Gaiman created. My comments reflect my personal tastes and limitations. Even though I didn't love the book, I was in awe of Gaimans ability to create such a detailed imaginary world.

Her stories 'Rootbound' and 'The Blessing of Brokenness' were great little reads and highlights of the book. Honorable mention to Fidelis Morgan for 'Down and Dirty' as well.

Must Read!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Surviving the Applewhites is a fantastic story about a troubled teen who has been shipped from home to home and school to school. \"Jake\" finds an identity as the troublesome teen and even when he isn't the cause of trouble he takes the blame for the attention and because he knows that no one would believe him if he denied having caused the problem. When Jake takes less than two weeks to be kicked out of a small town school the Eccentric Applewhite family take him into the homeschool they've set up for their talented children. Jake learns self reliance, self esteem, and how to take responsibility and care for others in his time with the Applewhites. Most of all he discovers himself in an extremely surprising and very non-cheesy way. The book is a fantastic read that every middle school-high school student should read. It's fun, different, and subconsciously teaches lessons. I can not stress this enough.

In the case of \"Surviving the Applewhites\", it was a recommendation featured in Discovery Girls magazine, and definitely deserving of the spot. The story is heart-warming, and, because our daughter grew up on musicals, and, in particular, \"The Sound of Music\", the adventures of the Applewhites resonated strongly with her.  I can see quite easily how life with the Applewhites can be made into a TV series like \"The Waltons\" - in fact, it's rather a shame it hasn't been done! In the words of said daughter: \"The book, `Surviving the Applewhites' by Stephanie S. Tolan is a funny, good-for-the-soul sort of book. \"Jake Semple is known as a bad boy. He set fire to his old school and got kicked out of every school in Rhode Island.  And he has spiky red hair, an eyebrow pierce and as many earrings as you can count. Now, only the Creative Academy in North Carolina at the home of the Applewhites will take him on as a student. Then Randolph Applewhite decides to cast Jake in his production of `The Sound of Music' as Rolf. Can Jake dance, act and sing as perfectly as everyone says he will? And can Jake and E.D., the only Applewhite who isn't artistic, survive each other? \"My favorite part was when Jake meets everyone in the Applewhite family. There's E.D., a smart, sensible girl; Cordelia, E.D.'s sister, a beautiful dancer; Ms. Lucille, aunt, an optimistic poet; Mr. Randolph, father,  a stubborn director; Ms. Sybil, mother, famous author; Destiny, E.D's four-year-old brother; Hal, E.D. big brother, recluse; Mr. Archie, Lucille's husband, carpenter; and Mr. Zebediah, grandfather, leader and carpenter. \"I would give this book five stars: two stars for the original and funny plot, two stars for the funny characters that made me wish I lived next-door to them, and one star for the humor shown throughout and in the plot. \"I would recommend this book to anyone who is home-schooled.

I read and LOVED Fragile Things (Collection of the short stories where my favorite was a story with this book's character Shadow), Star Dust (probably my #1 favorite), The Ocean at the End of the Lane (mysterious and compelling, you just had to know what next!) and Neverwhere (only 10% into the book, not yet hooked!). And as for American Gods, which I listened to on audio, I loved the protagonist, Shadow. I could relate to his cluelessness as I - the reader - spent much of the book being only slightly more than clueless but all in all, I am very glad to have read American Gods. What I found most difficult was not the fantasy, I love fantasy and can imagine anything, but accepting gods and dead people in human form. As a reader, when I couldn't imagine my characters - especially these \"gods\" - I couldn't get on board with the assumptions of the author, and thus I didn't bond as deeply with the characters and I kept reading mainly because I was curious and wanted to see where it would all lead Shadow. I find it strange that I felt this way about American Gods. I was on board with far more super natural and fantastical plots and characters in the other works by Gaiman but I just couldn't shake the doubt and ridicule my mind would conjure up around gods being in human form. And that blocked my true enjoyment of this work, which is still a genius piece by a genius writer, one that I simply could not fully appreciate. This is the kind of book you can appreciate greatly if you know a whole lot about the gods and deities of all cultures, past and present. The symbolism is all over the place. You'll see African gods, Russian gods, old tribal gods, ancient gods, Norwegian gods, and so much more but most of these gods are not American (hence my playful headline above.) You'll read about the sacrifices, the rituals, the tortures, the believers and the doubters, the old and the new gods. It all builds up to one premise: That America is not a place where gods survive or do particularly well. Gods don't belong here in this land and because the immigrants over thousands (yes, Gaiman believes settlers have been coming to America for many thousands of years!) brought their gods over in their minds, then those gods took form and shape and therefore existed because people believed in them. The new gods, Gaiman tells us, are the gods of cars, technology and a fast paced life (Hmmmm. Okay!!) and even those change quickly, proving yet again that Americans do not have loyalty to one or any type of god. I really should put \"god\" in quotations. Highly imaginative, with the usual excellent story telling and style, I only wish I could get appreciate the story more to give it a full 5-stars. That is my heart-felt review of the American Gods. This won't be the last book I read by Gaiman. Here's to the next journey with this talented writer.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>It works</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Undeserving of the hype</td><td>3.0</td><td>SPOILERS BELOW!! Finally got around to reading this novel I bought several years ago.  Tried then but couldn't get into it.  I had better luck this time.  I don't understand the effusive praise for this book.  There is no doubt that Gaiman is a talented author and has a certain flavor and flourish with language, but I was  over four-hundred pages into this before anything really happened. This book is almost all set-up, all prologue.  There's a war coming between the gods, old and new, we are told repeatedly.  While we wait for this war, we follow the protagonist Shadow around, as he eats, sleeps, does odd jobs, hangs out in a small town, meets iconic and well-known )but hardly fleshed out in this story) characters, gets visited by his dead wife, and dreams.  Not a lot else goes on for hundreds and hundreds of pages. When Gaiman finally decides to wrap it up, we discover the truth about some characters and see that the war we were promised is basically averted.  There is no great battle between the gods, and if there is even any minor clash between them it is largely downplayed. I get it.  The book isn't about that.  Despite the title and the endless prattling about the great war among the gods for once and for all, we don't get one.  Whatever.  The book was written well enough to be mildly enjoyable even if the story basically meandered for its entire length.  I just really expected more, given the reviews, ratings and praise heaped upon this somewhat interesting but essentially pointless novel.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Compelling True Life Story</td><td>5.0</td><td>This story is so compelling.

There were a number of reasons for this, but the biggest was that the plot dragged along. I could probably forgive this, if it was in favor of world building, but the author makes next to no attempt to actually flesh out the world she's plopped her protagonist into. For example, the magicians project their thoughts to each other to have conversations while in separate places, but we aren't given any type of introduction to it, so the limits seem nonsensical (although now I've written that, I wonder if they perhaps are nonsensical and that's why they aren't explained). It's almost like the author wanted to write a book about class uprising and the rest just didn't matter at all to her. The only reason I gave it 2 stars, instead of the 1 because there isn't really anything I liked about the book so far, is because it's possible that it got better in the chapters I didn't read.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>One of my favorite cookbooks!</td><td>5.0</td><td>This, along with the SBD SuperQuick cookbook, has become a staple in our house.

Angered by the annual purging of the slums where she lives, she throws a rock at the magician's magical shield and manages to break it. This sets the magicians on Sonea's trail as they wish to locate the untrained mage before she destroys the city. Magician's Guild is a fairly decent fantasy read. Sonea is realistically characterised as a mistrusting slum dweller and we get a look at the magician's who are trying to find her. We spend a good deal of the book, watching Sonea hide from the mage's and more time watching the mage's talk about her. That may sound like a criticism, but it's not really. We get to spend time with these characters, we understand their motivations and dreams. The world building is very good; not quite on the level of Robin Hobb, but at least I don't feel the persistent need to strangle the main character, even if she is slightly annoying and a little passive at times.  I do want to find out more about her and her future. Not particularly sold on the budding romance, but there's two more books to go.

I worked in two different locations in the Sierra with wilderness management being a major responsbility at one. I took part in the annual Central-South Sierra Wilderness managers working group and made a lot of friends as a result. The group was incredibly knowledgeable, professional and experienced managing the second largest area of designated wilderness in the lower 48 states, an area that is harder to manage than any other large wilderness area in the U.S.  I know, or know of, many of the people the author writes about in this book.  He hits the nail on the head on all of these. I did not know Randy personally, but knew many people like him, at least in most ways.  His lack of faithfulness to his wife and seeming unwillingness to balance his love of the wilderness with a good marriage did not endear him to me. His dedication and idealism were such that I'm sure we could have had long conversations next to a fire long into the night, comparing notes and sharing the same frustrations. I remember very well the fliers with Randy's picture on it and found it highly unusual to hear of an instance where a fellow employee was missing. In my career, which I am now retired from, I only heard of two employees ever being lost and both of these were in a very remote area of New Mexico where a new employee and a volunteer from the east got turned around. People who seek jobs in the outdoors, even those who are bright, shiny and new, have the skills to take care of themselves enough to show up at the end of the day or the end of a ten day tour. Of that group, those who want to work in wilderness or backcountry areas show up with even more outdoor savvy.  To have a BOLO (be on the lookout) flier arrive in your mailbox was something routine, but one with a park ranger's face and description was shocking.  I just didn't think it possible.  Several years later I was involved in putting a perimeter around Yosemite NP when a female ranger escaped a would be kidnapper and that, while unusual, happened a few times during my career. Given that background, I disagree with some reviewers who indicate, rather cynically, that Morgenson's disappearance did not warrant a book be written about it. They don't realize how rare this event was, and continues to be. I think Eric Blehm does a fabulous job of portraying employees of land management agencies in a realistic manner, most especially revealing the downside of being an employee for one of the four major land management agencies of the federal government.  The vast majority of them do so because they are dedicated and committed to the lands so many citizens take for granted. For most, choosing a career in the field is part of a life plan, not something that they fell into by circumstance. The public, by and large, doesn't understand the difficulties and sacrifices that natural resource agency employees make in pursuing their careers, especially if one decides to stay in the field for most or all of it, while staying dedicated.  I don't recall how many hundreds of times I was told I had the greatest job in the world or people who would say \"and I suppose you call this work.\"  Most often I would say \"you don't know the tenth of it!\"  On the other side of the coin Mr. Blehm was able to bring in some of the good aspects to the job, especially pointing out the sense of humor and how insightful people gain do it. I hope the fact that these employees are well above average intelligence is understood after the reader finishes the book. At times, during my career, I felt out of my league in the face of this. I compliment the author for being able to insert himself in a situation, and I hope I'm not exaggerating, that was highly emotionally charged. It would have been so easy to step on many toes and have a large number of people give him stone silence. While reading the book I became very aware of this and realized that he seemed to have spoken with nearly everyone who knew Randy. Given Morgenson's complexity I would think that this was not an easy line to walk. I highly recommend this book to a large group of people, not just those who love and travel in wilderness areas, but for others who haven't had much, or any, outdoor experience.  There is much to be gained by reading it. But there is one lingering question.  Where IS the meeting of the Gay Rangers for Christ being held?!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Great!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Sticks with you</td><td>5.0</td><td>This is a terrific book that takes you inside the life, and head, of a very admirable, but imperfect, person...Randy Morgenson, a park ranger in the Sierra Nevada. The book reads like a compelling mystery novel, but it's true. It is a very fitting tribute to Randy, who had much to share with human kind, but who was not able to find success as a writer himself. This book sticks with you, long after you've finished reading it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>A real page-turner</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am a sucker for Neil Gaiman books.

Those who knew him personally and wrote reviews on this site can answer that much better than I, but somehow my intuition tells me he would. Blehm does a commendable job of piecing together the life of a complex man who lived according to his own ideals, the love/respect for nature being among the highest. Like anyone, Randy's life was not without its blemishes and complications, but in many ways he was a self-made man, educated by one of the grandest and most reliable and trustworthy of teachers--nature herself. Unfortunately, such a teacher is greatly undervalued, if it is even given any passing respect or credibility today. Randy knew this and he knew nature's teachings in an intimate way that others might only dream of. It is sad and ironic that a man who harbored his own writing ambitions didn't live to tell his story, but I see Randy as one of those living artists whose canvass is reality itself. He carved out a deeply human story while living season after season in the grand Sierra mountain range. His life (while far, far from perfect) was a kind of high art whenever he put on his ranger uniform and followed his calling. I liked one simple antecdote Blehm gave that captures much of Randy's philosophy that often put him at odds with greater society. He would let the front lawn of his home grow and grow, leave it to its natural state, while the neighbors would be up in arms about this \"transgression.\" The lawn didn't get cut until Randy's wife finally did it. There are a great many things to explore and discover in this book!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Pleased</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Weird, sprawling, exquisitely written.</td><td>5.0</td><td>Book Report: Neil Gaiman's - American Gods.

In brief the story follows 3 woman- 1 Franny, a doctor who's recently lost a pediatric patient to cancer, 1 - Karen a inmate on death row and the last Celia whose husband was murdered. So it comes to pass that Frannys Uncle, who raised her after her parents died, dies-so Franny ditches her fianc, heads to her old hometown, and has some type of revelation- she ditches her well paid job ( all with the fianc) and takes up her Uncles old job at the prison ( he too was a MD) where she ends up taking care of Karen. And we're told early on that Karen killed Celia's spouse. The story's supposed to revolve around loss and grief and forgiveness - but good god what a boring read! There's too much time spent detailing the crimes of the other women on death row - you think they will have a bigger part to play in this novel, but they don't. Granny comes across as a self-centered selfish bitch-she dumps her fianc for no clear reason, is meaner than a cat in a sack to him when he comes to her hometown to try and help her deal with losing her Uncle-then she seems to just drink a lot and feel sorry for Karen. Celia has sex with a young fella and buys a bikini ( I know, what the hell does this have to do with the story) but she does work toward forgiving Karen, but that \" journey\" barely merits one page in the whole book. Sorry fellow readers-sloppy put together, I ended up thinking all 3 women should get killed off - I only kept reading out of frustration, I thought there would be a terrific twist ( as there was in \" how to be lost\" and boy was it a stunner!) but no such joy.  Stay away!  Or read How to be Lost</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Good Easy Read</td><td>4.0</td><td>The characters in this book are very likable. It's a fairly standard pleasure read fantasy book which was great for me since I'm fond of that style of book. The only thing that bothered me while reading it was that the characters tend to be super set in their ways and require great feats of evidence to change their views.

The book did not take long in terms of growing on me though it does feel like it is targeted at teens. The story moves at a blistering pace and is based on the life of Sonea, a girl with magical powers who does not know that she has them. She realizes that she can perform magic at a very inappropriate moment and heads back to the slums where her closest allies dwell. The story picks up from there as the magicians of the Guild start hunting for this talented stranger. The plot: It is exciting, fast paced but extremely simple. There is very little politics and the number of characters leaves nothing to the reader's imagination. You know who the bad guy is from the very start. Even then, it does not stop you from reading on. The characters: I would have to say that the characters are probably the best part of this book. Rothen really leaves an impression on the reader and comes across as a kind person. Similarly some of the support characters are also woven very well. The writing style: I am uncertain what to say about the writing style. It is good enough and I read the book fairly quickly. It is, like the plot, very simple but not necessarily the kind that makes you sit at the edge of your sofa forgetting about the coffee. The language is very simple and you do get the feeling that unlike other fantasies, this is specifically targeted to the teenage community. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will be starting the second book today (which is when I finished this). I would recommend this as a nice book to anyone who likes fantasy. It does not have the rich details that Robin Hobb, Tolkien or GRR Martin can generate but it is definitely something very readable.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Totally Compelling...</td><td>5.0</td><td>I read this book in 2 days.

You feel each woman's pain so clearly you feel you know them.  I actually teared up at the end!  It leaves you wanting more: what happened next with Franny and Celia? Questions on the death penalty, forgiveness and life itself will haunt you.  If you like books like Memory Keeper's Daughter and Time Traveler's Wife, you will become as totally engrossed in this book as I did.

While I don't feel the story is quite as compelling, or full of as much angst of living, like Everett Ruess, it is still a great story that is captivating. Its a story of the untamed nature, and Randy Morgenson's journey into, through and ultimately getting lost therein. As an avid back packer I enjoyed the description of the high country in Yosemite and Sequoia and the history and evolution of the wilderness system. The book covers Randy's life growing up in Yosemite, and his intense love of the Sierras. His passion and obsession with life as a back country ranger consumed every facet of his life and ultimately cost him everything. The focal point is the mystery surrounding his dissapearance, which pulls you through the book.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Imaginative and wild</td><td>4.0</td><td>I didn't know what to expect from this book, but I actually really liked it. This is an imaginative story in which a young girl meets a fellow with wild hair. She tries to help him tame it, but gets sucked in by a bear (yep, bears and much weirder things live in this mans hair). Dave McKeans unique and engaging illustrations mesh wonderfully with the story. Some may argue they are a little dark, but my sisters kids like them. As someone with curly, unruly hair (though not to the extent of Gaimans), it was easy to see what his inspiration probably was. Its fun to imagine what might be living up there. -Tanya Read (Read.

He is suppose to think woman are money hungry and manipulative and Honoria is suppose to show him their not? Honoria is worse than Marcus yet Karen wants to make her more lovable than him. She trys to portrays Marcus purchase of a nobalemans land as dastardardlly and cold harted when the man keeps drincking and gaming his fortune away yet Honoria is suppose to be a poor girl down on her luck. She does this a lot in her books. The woman say one thing is bad about the men and they are just as bad if not worse. I love her secondary characters and if you overlook Honoria actions at times then the story line is good you just wish they got together in a better way.

The story follows Chu, a little panda with a destructive sneeze, through his day as his parents take him to the library, a restaurant, and the circus. The illustrations are really the only thing that provides any substance to the story  they were creative and I think a kid would enjoy them.

All to often everything is \"awesome\" or \"amazing\".  If everything is extraordinary then doesn't that just mean its ordinary?  But I get it.  This isn't as severe a criticism as it may seem, and I'm not guiltless.  People communicating in a relaxed fashion don't really need to be rigorous.  But this tendency may rob you when you really want to deliver a message. So when I say this book is unique, I need the full meaning and impact of that word to come across to you reader.  I cannot say that I've ever quite read a book that I can adequately compare it to.  It's mythology, history, crime fiction, fantasy, satire and humanism kinda all rolled into one.  Gaiman really is good at creating atmosphere.  It is a gentle but inexorable sense of intrigue.  And the characters are illuminated in varying sharp and then subtle brushstrokes.  This book is like a tour of some fascinating museum.

The first story \"The Case of Four and Twenty Blackbirds\" was my favorite by far! As a detective tries to solve the murder of Humpty Dumpty, the story goes on to involve many more nursery rhymes characters, and I found myself chuckling and shaking my head at the absurdity of it all. But I loved it, absolutely loved it. October in the Chair was another favourite of mine. How Gaiman was able to capture the essence of each month and brought them to life...I mean, wow. And then there was Don't Ask Jack, which was a story revolving around a jack-in-the-box, which gives you chills. Finally, there was The Witch's Headstone, which was a glimpse at Neil Gaiman's other book The Graveyard Book, which I had already read. But it was still nice to go reread an excerpt of it almost and know that at the end of it, there is much more to the story.

Well, I did and I must admit that this is one of the most brilliantly boring books that I have ever read. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, Gaiman took me on a meandering road trip to places I never wanted to see. Dont get me wrong, its not all bad. Gaiman has created some interesting, well developed characters. The story is filled with moments of brilliance, with excellent dialogue and incredible humor. He has done an excellent job of getting into the American psyche, the old traditions that people brought from the old country and how it all has been watered down and lost through the great American melting pot. These gods are being slowly replaced by the new gods that we worship, the story is even more relevant now than it was when it was written. My biggest problem with the book was that I just didn't care. For all of its brilliance, there was no connection created. Its hard to be passionate about a passionless character. Shadow was a pawn, a tool used for everyones games, and he let it happen; he went with the flow and never got riled up. All in all, was American Gods a bad book? Absolutely not! Was it a great book? Not for me, but I suppose that depends on what you are looking for. Generally, I read for funAmerican Gods was not a fun book. Is Neil Gaiman an incredible author? Hell, yes. Will I be lining up for the next chapter in Shadows story? No way.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>just as it says</td><td>4.0</td><td>Just as it promises, this is a fine book to get condensed knowledge on just about anything.

The novel blends DARPA military technology and  genetics with mystical Arabian Djinn powers to produce this intriguing story line dating back to the Queen of  Sheba. Arabian folklore along with biblical history  paved  the way for its climatic ending. The characters were well developed and the mystery as to which one of the six was the other mole was riveting, yet surprising once the traitor was revealed at the novel's end.

I've never read something quite so imaginative yet understated. There's a magic to this novel that's hard to describe, sort of like the magic of the gods in the story. A lot of the events in this story are obviously fictional, yet I can't shake this subconscious feeling of extreme relevance. There's a lot that isn't explained in this novel, and I imagine that makes this a divisive piece of work. You have to be like the main character, Shadow, and simply accept certain things in order to enjoy this novel. It isn't for everyone, but if you can get into it it'll feel like something you were destined to read. It'll make you reexamine faith, America, and life in general.

Alexander is having one of those days too.  From the moment he gets out of bed in the morning, it seems like the whole world is lined up against him.  His brothers get toys in their breakfast cereal but he doesnt.  He has to sit in the middle seat during the carpool ride to school.  His friends all have better lunches than he does.  The day just keeps getting worse as it goes on, and eventually Alexander thinks that the best course of action might be for him to simply chuck it all and move to Australia! I love this book because its so easy to sympathize with Alexander and the situations that hes facing on this one particular day.  For example, anyone who has brothers or sisters knows how hard it can be to share a bathroom!  When you're having a bad day, even something thats normally fun, like going shopping for new sneakers, can quickly descend into arguments or even fistfights!  I imagine that Mrs. Viorst must be a mother or a teacher, because she certainly knows how young men can sometimes act out when things don't go our way.  The book follows Alexander through every heartbreaking moment of his bad day, and the hilarious illustrations by Ray Cruz do an awesome job of making the reader feel sympathetic.  Some of the pictures might seem a little dated since this book is now over forty years old, but I think that even kids raised up with Playstations and iPhones will still be able to relate to them. One of my favorite things about this book is the fact that it doesnt condescend to the reader, even though its a picture book aimed at younger men.  Sometimes youll feel like things aren't going your way, and theres absolutely nothing you can do but keep trying.  The world doesnt revolve around you, after all.  In the end, I actually appreciated the fact that no one rushes in to save Alexander from his bad day because, as his mother says, some days are like that. Even in Australia.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Used for school</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Adorable panda tale</td><td>5.0</td><td>I don't read a lot of kids' books. But put Neil Gaiman's name on the cover and I'll give it a try. Open the thick cover of \"Chu's Day\" and read these auspicious words: \"When Chu sneezed, bad things happened.\" Well, that just sets the imagination firing, doesn't it? We follow Chu and his worried parents to a library, a diner and a circus, all of which have allergens a-plenty. Does Chu finally sneeze and, if so, where? I'm afraid I shouldn't say. This book is recommended for kids age 4-8 on the back cover but seems targeted at the lower end of the scale. Gaiman, in the press materials that accompanied it, says this is \"the first book I've ever written for really little kids. Ones who cannot read. Ones who can only just walk. Those ones.\" It's a read-aloud tale that gives the reader license to use dramatic voices and goofy expressions to get the tale across. It's perfectly accompanied by illustrations by Adam Rex, whose tiny panda faces are particularly adorable. And it makes the subtle point -- spelled out on the back cover just to be sure you get it -- that \"even the smallest child can make big things happen.\" Cute. by Tom Knapp, the Rambles.

Otherwise, the book ended in an interesting way. I recommend you hit your local library and check it out or pick it up from the bargain bin when it goes on sale.

The people in it are complex and a lot more realistic than some works of fiction... The main characters are a cop that comes from a cooking background, a shrink that has enough mental problems of her own as well as a woman who may or may not be a psychotic killer or the savior of a small band of a people in a distant village. Plus a cast of interesting supporting characters that are very much alive themselves and could stand on their own just as easily as they help round out peopling the book's plot and pages. I'd say it's on par with another author, Carl Hiaasen... It has similar depth, humor and grit with out being overdone and weighty. As well as a more real world romance that unlike most \"dime store romance novels\" would likely see the characters staying together beyond the story of the one book or series.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>One of the only childhood books I have memorized!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>love it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>A Riveting Read!</td><td>5.0</td><td>Imagine Indiana Jones, (his name is Omaha Dunn here), taking-on 'the perfect storm' in the great Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, in central Arabia. In this desert place, beneath the burning sun, hurricane force winds blow up quickly. One can drown in an ocean of sand and remain interred forever. Add to this mix, the obsession to find a great fabled city, and a civilization lost thousands of years ago, now buried beneath the shifting dunes. Ubar, a rich and fabulous trading center of ancient Arabia, ruled by the Queen of Sheba, once rose out of the desert and then mysteriously vanished back into the sands. References to Ubar in the Koran, the Arabian Nights, and countless Bedouin tales told around desert campfires have captivated the imaginations of explorers and archaeologists. But all searches have been fruitless and the city remained lost. The storm, the search for Ubar and for a source of energy strong enough to fuel the entire earth, are just the basics of this enthralling story. James Rollins' \"Sandstorm\" also contains various subplots, no less exciting than the primary adventure, a terrific cast of characters, fascinating historical and scientific information, a love triangle and enough action, suspense and thrills to keep you reading long into the night. This is one of the most addictive novels I have read in some time. Once I began, I just couldn't put it down. Dr. Safia Al-Maaz, curator of the Arabian wing of the British Museum was abruptly awakened one night by the smell of smoke and the sound of sirens. She looked out her window and saw her wing of the museum in flames, and chaos in the streets. Dressing in panic she ran to the site, a short distance from her flat. The Arabian wing, priceless artifacts, and all the work she had accomplished over a 10-year period, were totally destroyed by a tremendous explosion. Clandestine organizations worldwide were alerted to this event almost before Safia reached the disaster area. And so begins a dangerous, lethal race to discover what caused the explosion, why it happened and what it means. Lady Kara Kensington, Safia's best friend and sponsor to the Arabian gallery, is devastated also. Both women have strong roots in the deserts of Arabia. Painter Crowe, member of a secret American government organization, is tasked with finding the incredibly powerful source of the explosion before anyone else does, and if possible, to contain it. Answers to these questions and many more are to be found in the desert country of Oman and the Rub al-Khali, a forbidden land where evil spirits reign, and where, perhaps, lies the mysterious city of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. Lady Kensintron organizes a small expedition, including Dr. Al-Maaz and Crowe, to travel to Oman to find these answers. However, Kara's expedition is not the only group determined to discover the desert's secrets; other shadowy groups trail the expeditions every move. Again, I was completely riveted. The historic detail is amazing. A great read & highly recommended!

The End is a meta-commentary on the murkiness of \"good and evil\" and as usual, Snicket borrows (or steals? depends on how you look at it, ha) from the literary greats in his library, most notably The Tempest by Shakespeare and The Odyssey by Homer. Two amazing works that, if you are familiar with them, demonstrate Snicket is working with themes of great depth and significance and ALSO that when held up to other writers who have tackled it before, Snicket fails to deliver. He's toiled away at creating a world where nothing is significant, red herrings abound, and there's no satisfaction at the end of the journey. Such is life. However, this doesn't excuse the extreme melodrama that is so tired by now, the one-sided characters, the endless string of deus ex machinas or the massive amounts of suspension of disbelief required to get through this book. The characters in the book are inflated caricatures of adult fears, arrogance, worries, cynicism, and intellectual atrophy. At the same time the kids are sniveling wimps ever moving towards adulthood. What do they have to look forward to? Life as caricatures! It makes no sense, unless we are meant to mourn the passing of the Beaudelaire's \"innocence\". Snicket stresses that fluffy books with lessons and morals are ridiculous but even Shakespeare wrapped his stories in life-lessons gleaned from life experiences. So what did the Beaudelaires and the readers learn by the end? That you can't trust everyone (or anyone almost), that adults are bad, that animals are good, that life is unfair. Oh well, it's emo for embryos. You can't trust a writer to write a good book even if it's a bestseller smash hit, adults sometimes make bad writers, animals (humans aside) don't read so good for them escaping this drivel and life is proved unfair when you've invested a good amount of time and hope into a writer who fails to deliver at the end of the day. Ah, maybe that's Snicket's answer to his critics: \"Life ain't fair, I'm rich, deal with it.\"</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Not sure.</td><td>4.0</td><td>Still thinking about it.

When her beloved exhibit explodes, she's reminded of everything she ran away from- bombs, terrorists, a fiance. She never dreamed that a ruined exhibit, would force her to return to her home. Accompanied by the exhibit's benefactor, who is also Safia's best friend, they form a rag tag team to find the mysterious phenomenon that caused the exhibit to blow up.

Up to these pages in the book I thought I was going to have a super read, but alas I was disappointed and the writing went downhill from here until the ending. Well the ending was a terrible disappointment. There were so many loose ends that needed answers that I have to wonder why this book was entitled \"The End.\" Young adults may find this book a great read, but I wonder if that is true. I believe the author gave this group of readers a big let-down in this series, and that's a shame because there are so few great young adult novels out there being published today. In summary, I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>favorite book</td><td>5.0</td><td>3 year olds favorite bedtime book.

As a rule, Lemony Snicket writes bad beginnings (pun intended).  Since book nine, the beginnings of these books were as tedious as \"The Little Engine That Could\" (referenced as the most tedious bedtime story ever in \"The End\").  However, this book like the ones that preceded it took flight about half-way through, never to look back.  There were metaphors galore, and many beautifully, disturbingly accurate depictions of how life really is, demonstrated by the absurd actions of characters. Count Olaf's character is taken to a place I never suspected, and I thoroughly enjoyed that.  I also liked that Snicket left many questions unanswered, because that--in truth--is the way the world works.  The way he chose to satisfy his loyal readers was to subtly tie everything together, while leaving a bit to the imagination. I laughed (particularly at the 'roast lamb' bit of CHAPTER FOURTEEN), I cried, and I enjoyed this book.  However, I am glad it is over.  It was great while it lasted, but one more book would have been one too many. \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" was a great series, and I will always remember how much I enjoyed it.  And, being that this is a review for the last book of the series and not the series of the whole, I have to rate \"The End.\"  I say that \"The End\" is a great end to the series, as is \"The End\" of \"The End\" which can be found at \"The End\" of \"The End\". 8/10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Loved it!</td><td>4.0</td><td>I discovered this book after reading FaceOff which included a short story by the author which included the same character.

This novel in the series is mainly set in Hollywood.  I knew right then that sometime serial killer and full time lunatic Serge would find plenty of candidates worthy of being dispatched.  He does not disappoint.  The narrator does a wonderful job with all of the voices. Two of my favorite characters (bad guys) are the two brother studio bosses, the Glicks, who fulfill every bad stereotype ever conceived about such movie people.  They are just about equalled in awfulness by the director of the biggest movie shooting at the studio, Ptoemkin. I wondered throughout how Serge would give them their coup de grace.  He outdoes himself.  There is another character who is being betrayed by this bunch and we don't know his relationship to Serge until the end.  He is an aspiring screenwriter who has a screenplay stolen by the brothers. This was a first class narration job so I would highly recommend doing this novel as an audio experience instead of a print one.

Tim Dorsey's The Big Bamboo is a novel that continues the lively Florida-centric antics of your favorite serial killer, Serge, and his always intoxicated sidekick, Coleman. While Dorsey usually keeps Serge in Florida, in this installment, he makes his way to Hollywood, with the usual hilarious results. Serge has gotten it into his head that Florida needs to retake the movie making crown from Hollywood, and attempts to write a screenplay that will once again make Florida the center of the movie industry. But the screenplay is a work in progress, as Serge continues to revise it to match his adventure, or the novel changes to match Serge's screenplay. I am not sure which. As Serge is writing, and rewriting, his screenplay, he finds time to get himself mixed up with an unscrupulous nursing home owner, Japanese mafia, \"redneck\" mafia, a group of retirees running a scam, his grandfather (not quite as \"eccentric\" as Serge), and a couple of Hollywood movie makers. As with all of Serge's adventures, this one does not lack for characters or laughs. This novel takes Serge out of his precious Florida, and with that, it seems that a little something was missing. And yet, it was an extremely enjoyable read. While most of the people with whom Serge interacts never know quite what to expect, putting him in Hollywood gives Dorsey ample opportunity to raise the bar, adding unique California characters and situations. Further, readers familiar with Serge, know that he can't sit still long. Placing him on an airplane for the trip to California was one of the highlights of the book. You may think that you have had bad flights, but they will pale in comparison to one described in the book. Finally, Dorsey pulls all of the characters together in an excellent climax, one that may require you to reread, as so many things occur, with great effect. Unusual in that the action does not occur exclusively in Florida, The Big Bamboo is a very good addition to the Serge Storms novels.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Serge Strikes Again!</td><td>4.0</td><td>Tim Dorsey has a wonderful way of making you side with the bad guy--his subtle twists and turns keep you guessing right up until the end!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>the novel was easy to read and a good story line</td><td>4.0</td><td>A very interesting outlook on the new American gods. i never even thought that people would worship technology. the novel was easy to read and a good story line.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>false</td><td>Lovely and Deep</td><td>5.0</td><td>It's Neil Gaiman.

Storms and his always drunk and buzzed sidekick Coleman. Following a scam set forth by his grandfather Sergio, Serge takes off on a frantic run into movieland. In the mix are piles of wanna-be-screenwriters, a massively over budgeted and delayed \"epic\" movie, coked-out studio heads, kidnapped model-turned actress, hitmen, and Dallas who is always searching for the next big party spot. It's crazy and fast paced with a change of scenery. I enjoy all the Serge books of Dorsey but thought several of them fell short of the regular output of this author. I found myself reading a hundred pages at a time on this one and not even realizing it. As the series progresses, Serge's frenetic and imaginative killing is dropping into low single digits per book and that may be a plus for the series. Afterall, is it really right for us to enjoy a book about a psychotic serial killer and a pot junky as the main characters? Overall, I liked the story/scam and even the trip to Hollywood for Serge & Coleman and I read it much faster than I expected to. It's a welcome addition to the series and I can't wait for more.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>4.0</td><td>good read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>It's still possible: a really original story!</td><td>4.0</td><td>Out of the ordinary and mainstream.

The basic premise is that every \"believer\" in America has brought with them their corresponding god. But as belief in the power of technology, the promises of science, and the ecstasy of sexuality have grown, the belief in classical deities has waned. As a result, these Gods have been left to fend for themselves ... scraping up whatever worship (and pocket cash) they can. But their frustration is growing, and the book charts the rise of conflict between these groups through the perspective of an unlikely narrator. (I will leave the rest to the reader's discovery) Overall, I loved the ways in which Gaiman was able to enflesh some of the traditional characteristics of the deities ... and yet at the same time, this was one of the significant shortcomings if the book. Just like the pantheon of Greek gods, the gods of Gaiman's world are flawed ... often tragically and dangerously so. But the one link that might have helped to bridge this would have been the role of the respective gods' believers in shaping the tragic flaws that become evident. Indeed, given the (narrative) possibility if multiple versions of each god being present in different locations and with different bodies of believers, I think Gaiman missed the chance to develop these differences (and perhaps even arrange meetings) between the deities of different sects within the same belief system. As it stands, Gaiman's book functions as a helpful critique, both of the ultimate ends of sacrifice-only-loving deities, as well as of the (sometimes unspoken) \"eternal\" promises of technology, medical science, entertainment, and consumerism. He does a magnificent job of paralleling our modern day \"worship\" of these ends with the millennia-old worship of deities. There was tremendous promise for me in the full narrative arc of Shadow, but it left me just a little unsatisfied in the end. Admittedly, however, this may be due in part to my own inability to grasp the full significance of the events in the last third of the book. In any event, the quality of the storytelling and the originality of the story makes me want to go back and see what I might have missed. I look forward, with pleasure, to rereading it ... and this itself might be the best compliment I can pay to this fascinating book.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>5.0</td><td>Good book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>4.0</td><td>Great book.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Nice start to the series</td><td>5.0</td><td>Nice start to the series.

But of course, it's not that simple. It's never that simple. They need motivation and they get it from Serge's Grampa, Sergio. You remember him from Cadillac Beach, Dorsey's prequel. Let's see, two Pretzel heads, Mark and Ford, from Zanesville Ohio, work their way to Holly-land and wind up as prop men for a less-than-ethical movie studio run by the brothers Glick and owned by Japanese mafia of sorts. Of course, everybody, from street vendors to movie grips to tourists from Minnesota, have scripts to sell. Including Ford. Of course, the Glick brothers scam Ford out of his. While all this is going on, the Glick brothers are trying to convince their artistic director, Potemkin, to finish his epic, All That Glitters. Then their newly discovered leading lady, Ally Street, is abducted and supposedly murdered. Is there money, lotsa money, involved? Is there gonna be mayhem? Is there gonna be a convoluted plot? Are there bad guys, really bad guys? How about The Tat and The Fullback, and bunches of other snuffable villains in big, black cars! Are our boys involved? Whaddaya think! I was a little leery of Dorsey taking on the Hollywood scene. After all, there should be enough Hollywood - and Disneyland - in Florida to provide fodder for another dozen Serge books. But, I have a sneaking feeling that Dorsey has spent a bunch of time \"out there,\" probably being wined and dined far too many times over movie rights to his first book, Torpedo Juice. And after Dorsey's seventh book, where he, Dorsey, took over the litany of geographical or locational minutae that Serge always did, I worried that he would do the same here. But Serge is back to his old mind-dump routine - great long lists of movies that were filmed in Florida, or those that were filmed in other places but attributed to Florida, or locations and descriptions of actors' abodes, or even the great detail of where and how Janice Joplin died - \"She hit face-first right where you're standing. October third, twenty-six years ago.\" Fantastic! These are the things that complete Serge's loveable psychopathic character. Thank God he's off his lithium for a while! Even Serge's offing of the bad guys is true Hollywood! Car chases, collapsing buildings, even the unparting of the Red Sea! Still, I think even Serge is losing a half-step after all these years. I mean, he ruined a perfect assassination of a bad guy by not having the right sized nails! I mean, that wouldn't have happened to the Serge of old, now would it? And even Serge is getting more than a little annoyed at Coleman who does nothing but drugs and booze, ordering him off the island (think Survivor). Oh, and mystery readers who love to read the last chapter first to find out who did it - go ahead! It ain't gonna help! And I'm sure it will make Serge and Dorsey's day! Tim, great job! Now bring Serge back to Florida! Please! We need him here!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>books</td><td>true</td><td>Love the book</td><td>5.0</td><td>I love this book and the author.

I was very happily proven wrong in that aspect. While Im not really a huge fan of Sci-Fi, I do like books that have so focus on aliens (Rama!), and I really enjoyed the whole time travel/existing at all times aspect to be very neat.

         "This was a spectacular continuation to the Black Magician series.  After reading the first book in the series I wasn't sure if I would continue it; but I am so glad I did.  This book is much better than the first one and incredibly interesting and engaging. I listened to this on audiobook and I really love the narrator of these books.  He is a pleasure to listen to and does an awesome job with character voices and emotion.  I would highly recommend listening to this series on audiobook. There is so much tension throughout this book, it just about kills you.  Sonea, Lord Robin, and the Administrator know a deadly secret about the High Lord Akkarin that they are desperately trying to keep secret.  As if this isn't enough stress Soneas fellow classmates have taken a strong dislike to her.  Sonea remains admirable through the book; she is smart and resourceful but continues to get caught up in events that test her.  I loved her character and my heart just broke for her throughout this book; there were a couple of times I just wanted to scream Enough, give the girl a break and some happiness! Much of the story is also told from Dannyls perspective.  I adored his parts of the book just as much as Soneas.  Dannyl does a lot of traveling and ends up on a quest to trace Akkarins travels and find out more about the ancient history of magic.  These parts of the book had a lot of adventure and history involved in them and I loved them.  Both Sonea and Dannyl develope love interests in this book; much of that is in the background but it was nice for these characters to have some happiness in midst of all of their trials. The only thing that really irked me throughout this book was everyones fear and assumption that The High Lord Akkarin was evil.  Yes, Sonea saw him practicing black magic but did anyone ever try to figure out why Akkarin would do that?  Throughout the book Akkarin remains alof, intimidating, and at times strict and even a bit cruel.  However, he is never outright evil and I cant help but believe he isn't the problem in this book.  It bothered me that all the magicians and novices that know his secret just assume that he is evil without finding out if maybe he has a greater ulterior motive.  It made me disappointed in the intelligence of the surrounding characters and seemed short-sighted to me.  I was especially disappointed in Robin and the Administrator. The other thing I found frustrating was how all the magicians turned a blind eye to how Sonea was tormented by her classmates; at times this torment is so severe as to be torture.  I found it disturbing that the adults in this book are okay with the students ganging up on and torturing one young girl. Overall aside from the above two complaints I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  The whole book is written in a fantasy style that feels a bit older to me (like 90s epic fantasy) and I enjoyed it a lot.  There is some excellent world-building in here along with a complex plot and characters that are easy to engage with and relate to.  The book ends on a cliffhanger that will absolutely kill you; I want to read the third book immediately!  I would recommend to fans of classic fantasy.",

         "While Tess Monaghan gives a workshop at the Baltimore Beacon-Light, her boyfriend Crow is busy making his regular deliveries to the area soup kitchens. He meets a young black teen who offers to change the slashed tire on the car Crow's been driving. During the course of changing the tire, Crow learns that Lloyd drifts because he no longer feels welcome at home. His mother has a new man in her life who doesn't accept most of Lloyd's stories of innocence (no matter what the issue or problem). It's a brutally cold day out and Crow takes Lloyd to eat the evening meal and then to Crow and Tess' home. Tess isn't nearly as accepting of the young man as Crow but agrees to let him spend the night. During casual conversation, Tess mentions the death of an assistant US Attorney, Gregory Youssef. Lloyd has a strange reaction to the information. During the early hours of the morning, Lloyd decides to rob Tess and Crow. Instead of stealing a few items and making a getaway in Tess' Lexus, Lloyd is involved in a wreck and runs away on foot. Lloyd's strange reaction to Youssef's name bothers Tess and she sets out to find him. Tess' curiosity brings a number of unexpected legal and moral consequences. Crow takes Lloyd out of Baltimore while Tess faces a dangerous threesome from the government. They threaten to take her life apart and do the same with her parents, Crow, his parents, their relatives, etc. By the time they started overturning the rocks in Tess and Crow's lives, I was boiling mad. If the government can do even a portion of what is outlined in this book, John Q Public is in serious jeopardy. This is a slick story with lots of red herrings. Crow takes a more central position in this book and the reader learns more about Crow's character. I enjoy the fact that there are returning characters who grow and change, adding a new dimension. 4 Stars",

         "I admit, I haven't read much Gaiman. The Graveyard Book and Good Omens are all Ive ever known of Gaimans work. And while I thoroughly enjoyed both books, I was never quite prone to picking up another one of his works. That has since changed. American Gods has been on my reading list for a while and after getting annoyed with myself for not reading it sooner, a friend of mine put it on our book clubs reading list. I was so thankful to finally have a reason to crack this one open. Do you ever have a book that just feels good in your hands? Well, my copy of American Gods was exactly like that. I loved just flipping through the pages and feeling its weight. That being said, this book was difficult for me to get through. Gaimans writing style is at its best. His proficient use in descriptions and alluring paragraphs does nothing but amplify the classic this book will become. However, I found the book exhausting to complete. Gaiman weaves in story after story that tell of the Gods of old. And while they do give a nice background to the characters involved, they mostly seem unnecessary and tiring. Gaiman did everything correctly in creating American Gods and his ultimate lesson in all of it is strong. But the ending left something to be desired. All in all, a decent read albeit long. I cant wait to see what they do with it in the TV remake.",

         "Are you entrepreneurial material? It's best to find out before you invest your money. Your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are. As a Master Trainer for the United Nations Entrepreneurship Capacity Building Program, I can vouch for the importance of a mindset change from being a technician, a task-doer so to speak, to providing results. Having technical capacity is not the problem; making your business a success is. That's where the managerial and entrepreneurial aspects of a business play a part. Let me give you an example: Having delivered more than ten thousand hours of training in several countries, I can affirm that the first challenge is in setting goals that give long-term vision and short-term motivation. For many people, the urge to jump right to action even before they set goals is strong, but as Yogi Berra used to say, If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else. In the book, Gerber quotes the book of survival by Anthony Greenbank who says, to live through an impossible situation, you don't need the reflexes of a Grand Prix driver, or the muscles of a Hercules, the mind of an Einstein. You simply need to know what to do. Don't think you will be reading a how-to type of book. Far from it. This book has a plethora of sharp insights for inspiration to set your attitude straight and begin producing results! You will understand that when you know the difference between working in your business versus working on their business, i.e., making your business grow. I highly recommend this book because instead of continue looking at your business as a one-off operation, you will see it a prototype for a large number of franchises you may add later on. Such simple mindset change will put you to work in the business not only as a technician but also as a manager (putting systems and controls in place) and, above all, as an entrepreneur (having a vision of how the business can create sustainable added value for all key stakeholders).",

         "A short book, with stylized Chinese fish on its cover, Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather was an intriguing foray into foreign short stories for me. The author is a Nobel prize winner, so I knew at the outset that this wouldn't be light reading. But the stories are truly fascinating. In the first tale I feel like a fly on the wall, listening to someone speak; is he remembering the past? Is he talking to his family, or to his wife, or to the pictures in his mind? The stories each left me slightly off-balance, not quite sure what I was reading. But the title story, Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather, suddenly centered me as the narrator looks into memories of his past and finds himself lost in change. The final story, In an Instant, fills most of the second half of the book. It is a beautiful piece, reminding me of a Chinese plate my grandmother had. I don't remember much about the plate, except that there were blue pictures, a temple and a bridge, trees, and a feeling that the closer I looked at one image the more likely I was to find myself in another. The writing flows in the same way between scenes, adding imagination to each and drawing the reader on with the movement of the prose. There's no story as such, but there's reflection and change; it's oddly mesmerizing, like that moment of falling asleep or of waking up, when objects take on meanings that really belong to something else. It takes much more than an instant to read, and stays longer than an instant in the mind, but it's beautiful in the same way as that plate. So now I'll go back and reread them all, in light of the mysteries of memory and time, and in appreciation of something truly different and impressive.",

         "The Novice is the second book in The Black Magician trilogy. In it, we see Sonea actually moving into the Guild as a full-fledged novice, including classes and classmates. Sonea doesn't have an easy time of it, mostly because her background is unacceptable to most of her classmates. One in particular sets out to make her life miserable and turns the entire group against her and tries to make her look bad to the rest of the Guild as well. While not unfamiliar - it's an oft used trope, the first that springs to my mind is Talia's story in Arrows of the Queen - it's an effective one as most people and especially teens will be able to identify with it, as almost everyone has experienced bullying in real life, be it. A victim, a perpetrator or a bystander. Akkarin plays a larger role this time around; while he was an ominous, mysterious and shadowy figure in the background in the first book, he takes a far more active part here, though no less ominous. Through Sonea, we get glimpses of the man, but what we see is of course heavily coloured by her distrust and dislike of him. And I got my wish about seeing more of Dannyl and Lorlen as they both got their own points of view. We see far less of Rothen, due to the fact Sonea and Lorlen aren't allowed to speak to him or each other, and I missed the warm bond between Rothen and Sonea, as I loved those scenes in the first book. The addition of Dorrien, Rothen's son, is a nice one and gives Sonea yet another friend, but also another liability. Dorrien is a fun character and I liked that he brought some light and levity to Sonea's rather bleak world in this book. We also see more world building with Dannyl travelling abroad, not just Elyne, the land he's sent to as an ambassador, but also Vin and Lonmar. I like Dannyl's storyline, not just because of the chance to see more of this world, but also as it touches on another hotbed issue: about intolerance and accepting who you are in the face of it. I loved Dannyl's growth in this and the fact that the author shows that it isn't just those who blatantly discriminate against people who are 'other' who are harmful, but also those who just stand by and let it happen, even if they themselves don't feel that way. Sonea shows a lot of growth from the first book as well, she reads a lot older than she did in the previous book and she gains in confidence, power and skill, which make it easier for her to defend herself against Regin and the isolation she finds herself in after becoming the High Lord's novice. Regin is a cretin, I found him utterly loathsome and I still don't understand why no adults stepped in sooner to stop him. I loved how Sonea finally stood up to him and how smart she is in beating him without stooping to his level or hiding behind her status. The Novice doesn't suffer from second book syndrome. While it's a natural continuation of the storyline from book one and it sets stuff up for book three, it does have enough action in and of itself to not drag. I loved this second book and am looking forward to the next one, called The High Lord, to see if the finish of this trilogy is as good as I remember it.",

Trudi Canavan has spun a very enticing web of politics, action and magic however at times I have found the writing style to be wanting. The plot is just as strong as the first book with more twists and some of our questions being answered. Trudi keeps the reader absolutely confused about the reality surrounding the strange activities of the High Lord and this ambiguity is handled very well. I am sure Dannyl's character will appeal to many readers as he ventures on a journey of not just his new duties but self discovery. It did not take me long to finish this book and it was like a delicious bite of a flapjack just before the big crunch to finish it off! I have enjoyed this fantasy thoroughly thus far and would recommend it to all fantasy readers. It is different in terms of the plot, the \"world\" and the balance of magic and reality.

In this second book, Canavan is more assured as a writer and, most notably, sets up a much more contained story that, as a result, is more gripping. Again the book is hardly original in its elements. Sonea, our titular heroine novice, is at a school for magicians, after all, and we get a fair amount of the Usual Stuff in this area. But the setup quickly puts her, her mentor Rothen, and others into a difficult situation. Plus she has conflict with another novice. The character development is sensible and there is some palpable tension as the story progresses. Less good is the homosexual subplot involving Dannyl. While there is nothing offensive or bad about it, it isn't particularly necessary or even that well-developed. It doesn't serve any particular purpose, when really it should. Overall the book is enjoyable for the tension it develops. It's good beach fare and the high point of the trilogy.",

         "The first half or more of this book is lyrically beautiful. Paradoxically it is a memoir by a young woman whose lower jaw is destroyed as a child by a rare form of deadly cancer. The treatment that saves her life not only disfigures her but basically takes away her childhood at the age of 10. That she can review those years with poetry is remarkable, and that the poetry is beautiful is breathtaking. But the book is fundamentally flawed. The author is an 'unreliable narrator' in her own story. Her memory of medical procedures is very clear,and these are among the most haunting images in the book. Her memory of family, school and social events are cloudy, and I think we need to regard them as metaphorical more than factual. For example, it does not seem likely that her father could simply not come home from work one day, stay in a hospital for months before dying, that the author (who clearly loved him deeply) saw him only once and was casual about his death? It seems she is more comfortable talking about her face than about her life. The last one-third of the book lacks poetry or coherence,and simply fades away. Her 'insights' into true beauty do not ring true; there is no epiphany or resolution and I do not think any of us really believe that she finds peace.  As in life she did not. It's too bad. It could have been a beautiful book and a beautiful life.",

I don't think this is as good as his best novels.  I think this one stands out as far and away a great work.  I don't even want to call it just literature, because its really a kind of scientific paper, or one of those books by Stephen Jay Gould that throws in some data, anecdotes, talks with others, and tries to make a grand conclusion about something in nature.  Vonnegut does that in his least cloying, least clever and most truly natural and funny way here.  I am glad that I waited 30 years to read this book.

         "Present day. United States. A young land where the beliefs of old withered amidst the speedy rise of capitalism. A land where time was money and there was no time for antiquity. The old gods grow restless as the new ones of Technology and Media grow powerful and ambitious. It may result in war, and at what cost and with whose lives? At the center is an unlikely protagonist: Shadow. Large, burly, slow to speech, Shadow is not slow of thought. A tangled youth and a complicated life send him down the wrong path, made worse for the loss of the one he loved. How does one even begin to review such a tome? It is literary, fantasy in a contemporary setting; skating the line between magic and magical prose. This is no slugfest of the gods, but a deep question of who we are, and what we stand for. Along the way we meet with a medley of characters you half know from legend, scraping by in a land that has forgotten them, their powers diminished. But there is a gathering, a last battle; one where you don't know if it is for good or ill. At times Shadow makes the oddest of choices, always furthering the book and intriguing, but not always consistent, but then, here is a man embroiled in turmoil that I can hardly conceive. If his decisions seem unlikely, so is his predicament. The one failing I felt for the book was an unfulfilled expectation. All along I expected the gods to battle, for magic to play a greater spot in this struggle. It does and it does not. Most of it is behind the scenes, alluded to with finesse and skill. It does not take from the book, only from my expectation. Which, coming from a love of epic fantasy, it is only to be expected that I would harbor desires of epic confrontations with visceral results. Instead the struggle is beautifully portrayed in prose that flirts and holds hands with the literary, but rarely feels overdone. This is a book to enjoy and one to make you think. While I haven't seen the new TV series, I hear good things. Have you seen the new show, have you read the book? And what do you think of the adaptation?

The ship is near Galapagos and we meet the few people who are either soon to die or soon to journey from Galapagos to a nearby island where they will make a home for the future of mankind (but they don't know that). The narrator is a ghost related to Kilgore Trout (recurring character in Vonnegut's works) and we get a bit of each person's backstory. Theirs quite a bit of Classic Vonnegut type commentary on the state if current society, how our current \"big brains\" function (human thinking) and how it differs in the future. Overall it's quite enjoyable but it doesn't resonate with me as other works of his.",

         "When I first picked up this book and scanned what it was about, I expected it to be a straight-forward account - it is a memoir about growing up with cancer and subsequently, a disfigurement. Therefore, I was surprised when I realized that the book was not what I had been expecting. It turned out to be so much more than just going through the emotional process with her. Even without my being able to relate to the childhood that she had undergone, I still found Grealy to be relatable. She does a very good job of communicating the normalcy that exists for someone who most would not view as normal. Immediately, I found that endearing. She is an award-winning poet and it shows in her writing, but for the most part, her account does not get lost in the indulgence that sometimes happens with poets. The structure is still clean and easy to walk through, as though you really are just walking along with the author on this journey. I found the last couple of chapters to have many moments of repetition. She struggles with the concepts of truth and beauty and continually re-mentions this challenge - often the same thoughts, just worded differently. These ideals are clearly important to Grealy and it shows in her need to keep bringing them up. With repetition being the case however, those moments can be taken with grace because there is an understanding that, given what her book is about, these are the focus items of discovery for her (and hopefully for the audience). All in all, I enjoyed it - she was charming and sweet in this account of her life.",

         "If there are any constants in Lois Bujold's writing, there are two: trials of the spirit and surprises, and this book is no exception. Ingrey kin Wolfcliff has his duty: to investigate what seems to be a strange murder, and to bring to justice an even stranger murderess, one possessed of, and by, a leopard.  But, of course, not all is as it seems, and Ingrey ends up facing challenges moral, physical and, ultimately, philosophical, before his Long Night can end. This book has it all. Comedy high and low. Tragedy to make even the Gods weep. Treachery and forgiveness. Laughter and heartache. Mercy and vengeance. And the true horror implied by the words \"mostly dead,\" which for me will never again be funny. Above all, Bujold's characters are always *people*, with all the strengths and weaknesses that implies. Along with all of the above, this book is a most wonderful romance, as Ingrey and Ijada meet, utter strangers, and go on to find first friendship, and then love, and learn why their hearts must truly beat as one, if either is to beat at all. \"Hallowed Hunt\" is even better than \"Paladin of Souls,\" and I wouldn't have believed that possible before I had read it.",

And while the others spent a lot of time on the complex religion, this one got a lot more in-depth and included an earlier, native belief system. Generally, it was just boring.

         "Beyond the time-jumping science fiction premise, the story of this novel is actually a somewhat somber one that is truly satirical and not plainly comedic. The book does deal with stories of the war after all, and there's no way to dress that up in any manner. The repeated element of the narrator saying \"So it goes\" whenever death is discussed is an odd one. It's there to sort of soften the blow of all the deaths that Billy has witnessed, but there's no dressing that up in any true fashion, I suppose. The book may seem a little confusing at first given the non-linear flow of events. At the very least all stories that take place during the way follow one another more or less chronologically leading up to the actual bombing of Dresden. Everything else is sort of fair game for mixing up and even I had a bit of a struggle putting things together right away. It doesn't help that I'm instinctively trying to read into why we're made to experience certain flashbacks in the order they are presented. It all has to make sense somehow, right? There are slow burn TV shows and this is a bit of a slow burn book, primarily because of its disjoint narrative flow. But when things come together, they really come together and the end result is pretty heavy. The whole notion of being able to travel back and forth along one's timeline does push the notion that our lives are more or less fixed and there's nothing that we can do to change the course of our lives. And while that sort of feels like a defeated attitude to take, it's a sort of understandable perspective to take when it comes to a man having seen a massacre like Dresden. Beyond the aliens and the time travel, this book is really about Billy finding a way to come to terms with what he had experienced during the war. There's the added challenge that he actually has to re-live the events over and over again at random intervals because of his odd new ability. And that could be enough to break just about anyone, but still he manages to persevere and he gains new perspective on things given his traveling. Slaughterhouse Five isn't an easy book to read, but it's certainly a compelling and fulfilling one. I doubt that this review can be used to help anyone write any sort of school paper about this book, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone tries to do precisely that should they read this review all the way to the end.",

         "After reading Slaughterhouse Five, I proudly gave the book four stars. I was fascinated by the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim's, journey. He \"time travels\" to various points in his life, an ability he says he learned from the aliens that abducted him. Without giving too much more away, you begin to see how every stop in his journey all revolves around the infamous firebombing of Dresden, the main setting of the book. The firebombing really changed him and reliving all of these moments gives his experiences much more meaning.  I also liked the use of actual imagery in the book. The pictures aid a little in making the story more personal despite the outlandish alien abduction. I did not like the vulgar language used in the book because I felt it covered up Pilgrim's innocence. This was more of a personal thing and probably was used for that same purpose. I would recommend this to those looking for a radically different read. The common phrase used in the book \"So it goes\" will probably become your own explanation for death as it was for Pilgrim, who experiences frequently. It would be the perfect epitaph for the man who has experienced it all and sees it all on a daily basis.",

Unlike them, especially unlike Ista, he _is_ quite capable of physical deeds of derring-do. When we meet him, he seems to be trying to keep his head down (and on his shoulders) and do his job. However, his job brings him into the presence of a woman who reminds me, and possibly only me, of Cordelia Naismith Vorkosigan, from whom \"honor flows as from a fountain\" and he has to involve himself in great and perilous things for her sake.

         "I read this book in May 2013 (I really need to get better about posting timely reviews), and while its been criticized as being choppy, disjointed, all over the place, and unintelligible, I came away with a profound sense of the disastrous effects of war on the human psyche. The book is based on Vonneguts own experience as a prisoner of war where he, by a strange twist of fate, survived the fire-bombing of Dresden during World War II. The main character, Billy Pilgrim, was a prisoner of war held captive in an underground meat locker of a slaughter house, Slaughterhouse 5, that is.  In a reversal of fortune, his prison had become his salvation, delivering him from an apocalyptic scene of unimaginable destruction when the city of Dresden was almost obliterated from the earth. In the aftermath, his surviving captors forced him to perform the harrowing task of recovering and burning the bodies of the deceased. The book isn't written in chronological order. Instead, it jumps forward and backward in time, jarringly, to various periods in the main characters life including time spent with aliens on the planet Tralfamadore. Yes, aliens. Was the character abducted by aliens? Did he become unstuck in time? Or were these just coping mechanisms in the aftermath of war? Reading this book reminded me a little of someone who had experienced psychological trauma so severe that their personality split as a means to deal with reality. This condition, known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder) is a trauma-based disorder. Its interesting that PTSD, common among war veterans, is also a trauma based disorder, and considering Vonnegut was a war veteran my perception of the novel may not be far off the mark. Vonnegut himself described the book as so short and jumbled and jangledbecause there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre. When youve experienced atrocities so unimaginable, its hard to make sense of anything and its easy to understand how Billy Pilgrim became unstuck in time and found refuge in another world. And so it goes Opening Line: All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. Memorable quotes: - Why me?  That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?  Yes.  Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.  And Lots wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human. So she was turned into a pillar of salt. So it goes. Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.",

         4,
         "This is a good biography of an important leader during World War II. There can be no doubt that General Marshall made extremely important contributions to World War II and these authors have given Marshall due credit. But these authors have gone further: Marshall despite being a critical wartime leader was no troop commander; the authors therefore had a difficult task of separating accomplishment as a manager from the accomplishments that the management made possible. If the book at times seems somewhat critical of Marshall, it could have been even more critical. But the authors successfully avoided the pitfalls of doing so. A manager, such as Marshall, was needed because of the complexity of the war and the sad military state that the United States entered the war with. Anything less than Marshall's managerial skills would have been disastrous for the Allies. But, by military standards, managers are criticized for not being leaders on the battlefield. Fortunately the authors recognized this and avoided the overt attempts to defame Marshall for this. At times, the book drags as the authors attempt to explain the political predicaments that Marshall was forced to endure. The authors point out that Marshall was apolitical: but this is hardly true. In order to survive in the realms that Marshall worked in, he had to have political acuity. In fact, his very appointment as Chief of Staff was a very political process which Marshall succeeded. Thus, thus authors, in my opinion, have overlooked and understated some facts in Marshall's life.",

I was utterly convinced that I'd read it before, but I remembered really bizarre parts of it, such as Shadow being cold in Lakeside and the secret of the klunker on the lake. I even watched season 1 of the new television show (enjoying it immensely), and had myself convinced that I was thinking of an entirely different book. So I read it, and realized that I had read this before. I have no idea why my brain lost literally all the interesting things about it (a visit from Shadow, perhaps?), so I enjoyed this revisit. Since this book is much-beloved (though I will admit to not seeing the obsessive appeal) and has over 500k ratings on Goodreads, I'm not sure there's much I can add to the conversation around it. Having just watched the television show, I can comment on how brilliantly cast it is. I was completely unable to disconnect Ian McShane from Mr Wednesday as I read, and I was genuinely startled by every physical description of Shadow that did not match that of Ricky Whittle. I do appreciate some of the updates that have been made from the book to the show, based on era of storytelling. In 2001, the image of Technical Boy as a black trenchcoat-wearing, acne-scarred, overweight \"kid\" was entirely accurate. Today, an obnoxious hipster with a vape is even more appropriate. I can easily see myself re-reading this book for a third time (possibly after Shadow has removed all the interesting bits from my head again), but I'll definitely see if I can find an annotated version of some sort. Because so much of what's interesting about the gods in this novel are what Shadow doesn't know, and that's what I want to find out.",

One example of Manns thought-provoking observations involves the influence of the artist and concludes that the trust the public places in us is highly ridiculous, education of the young through art something that should be forbidden. Because how can someone be a good teacher when he has an inborn drive towards the abyss? My father, a highly respected high school and college teacher of art and art history disproves this conclusion.  In any case, if the novel contained more of these assertions, I might understand how it has attained a certain level of literary prominence, but there are three elements of this book that are difficult to understand: 1. The protagonists infatuation and obsession with young Tadziu defies comprehension even though the author devotes most of the book to this endeavor. 2. It is also difficult to understand how a novel about an esteemed author, which contains many reflections on his life and his art, contains only three brief sentences about his family.  There are not very many concise sentences in this novella, but the sentences about his family are three of them. 3. From the perspective of this reviewer, it is incomprehensible that this author won the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature.",

         5,
         "This short novel by Thomas Mann has become a classic on its own merit first and then because he has been adapted to the cinema and the stage quite many times. The best known adaptations are Viscontis film in 1971 and the opera by Benjamin Britten in 1973. This book was also written at the end of Thomas Manns life and though it cannot really be said to be autobiographical, which anyway has no value to discuss and appreciate it, it is obvious that Thomas Mann has had that kind of experience first hand: becoming old, feeling death crawling and creeping behind the wings closer and closer, and attaching his dream of a second youth to the first youth one meets and sublimates into a fancy of beauty as an aesthetic dimension to cover up the deep psychological need to find a recipient for the mission of continuing the exploration of the world, mental and physical, intellectual and material, that one has done all along their life. This need, this desire, this quest is universal among all artists and intellectuals, maybe among all human beings as the survival instinct of the mind. It cannot be fulfilled genetically. It does not lead to anything hormonal which could be seen as unethical, and would have been seen as unethical in Thomas Manns time: it would have been pedophilic love, since Tadzio is hardly 15, probably less. It is symbolical, spiritual, mental maybe psychical. Apart from and beyond this personal existential remark, the book has tremendous qualities. The first one is its shortness. The subject  in a way it is an artistic testament  is treated in very few pages with very little action but always precisely stated and clearly described. No useless embellishment on the action itself. That enables the author to concentrate on the sole mind of the main character who is a successful German author who has preached all his life the separation of arts from life, from passion, from sentiments, from feelings. Arts are supposed to cultivate beauty in themselves and to look for beauty in the world. Gustav von Aschenbach is trapped by his own aesthetic ambition and practice when in his old age he meets with his eyes, and that will never be a meeting on any other level, and when his mind relays that vision into a deep reflection on what life is, what beauty is, what purity is. His eyes meet a young Polish youth that can be deemed to be 15 or less years old. The main character is attracted to this Knabe as he calls him in German, boy as is translated in English, visually, hence by the only vision of the boys body since he cannot understand Polish and that foreign language becomes some kind of music. The shape of the body, the proportions, the flexibility and articulations of that body that is fit without being athletic, still young and not wrapped up in too much muscle and fat. He is attracted by the face and the hair of this young teenager and at this level no one can describe the beauty of a face. Words can eventually describe the face but they cannot capture the beauty itself which is a very complex conglomerate of elements. The last attractive element is the light, very light indeed before the First World War, nudity of the young teenager since he is mostly on a beach in some bathing suit, which is a suit really. It only liberates or undress the arms and the legs from the knees down, maybe half thigh down. Visconti makes the boy bathe in the sea is some kind of swimming trunks that denude his body from the waist up. I am not sure at all that was standard in 1911. This first quality of the book is amplified tremendously by the Greek mythical references all along the pages. I am not going to list them all but systematically they refer to love (probably identified as identical to intercourse) that leads to death in a way or another. Some of these gods or semi-gods are messengers of death or have the power of saving someone who is close to death or dying, like Zeus taking Dionysus in his thigh, or Zeus against and others turning some victims of jealousy into stars and constellations. These references establish a full parallel between the main character and these victims of love and jealousy. But he goes one step further by referring to Socrates and Phaedo, particularly the death scene in Platos text, The Death Scene from the Phaedo, [...] The death of Socrates drinking his hemlock to which he had been sentenced is to be set in parallel with the death of Gustav von Aschenbach in the story. Note here how the name of the character is conveying the idea of death: a river of ashes. A close study of these references and their mapping in the story would show how symbolical they are. But let me give you one example of how the main characters wording of his approach of beauty is also symbolical and of what. The original for The happiness of writers is the thought that can be entirely emotion and the emotion that can be entirely thought, is Glck des Schriftstellers, der ganz Gedanke, der ganz Gefhl, das ganz Gedanke zu werden vermag. Apart from the fact that I find the translation less concise, less poetic and more abstract in its use of the generic plural writers or the generic philosophical  definite article in the thought or the emotion and even the happiness where Thomas Mann had used the adjective ganz to particularize what thought or emotion he was speaking of, the thought and the emotion that the author was constructing or experiencing right now, hence the necessary singular of Schriftsteller But the translation misses something more important: the symbolic music of the sentence. The first alliteration in /g/ seven times and the closing semi-alliteration in /w-v/ at the end bringing that seven to nine and the first alliteration in fact is one /g/ plus then alternating /ganz/ - /Gedanke/ - /ganz/ - /Gefhl/ - /ganz/ - /Gedanke/ which is a perfect Davids Star or number of Solomon, three adjectives-three nouns all carrying the same alliteration and alternating. It is obvious that the very deep and ancient wisdom of Solomon expanded into the seven days of the week of creation (6 days of work and one day of rest) or the seven days of the Holy Passion ending with the death and resurrection of Jesus in the last three days are turned into a diabolical reference to the Apocalypse, the Beast, the end of this world and life, and maybe salvation at Doomsday. The English translation is far from carrying that kind of symbolism. This novella should be analyzed from that original German version to understand how Thomas Mann is a symbolical mind that sees beauty in those patterns, Gestalten would be the German plural word, that are both the symbols and the expression of the mind and the conception of beauty it develops or constructs. If we take this novella as being in the tradition of symbolism in German arts we find out that the death of Venice is also the death of Gustav von Aschenbach, and this latter death does not enable him to actually transmit the mission of continuing his work to Tadzio. The transmission is expressed at the end in the last look but in the reverse order: it is Tadzio who becomes Hermes and by looking back at Gustav from the sea and locking his eyes onto Gustavs eyes takes him into the infinity of death and Gustav dies in his chair on the beach. Tadzio becomes the psychopomp of Gustav von Aschenbach into the immensity of space and death. That is a phenomenal vision of mental and sqpiritual survival and the failure that Thomas Mann wants to express as for Gustav von Aschenbach who just did not have the courage to confront and brave social conventions and norms and establish contact and communication with Tadzio. This contact, this communication with a younger character who becomes the surrogate of his own youth and the continuation of his own life after his own death was close at hand but he did not choose it, he did not have the courage of surviving intellectually, spiritually by committing his remaining years of life to a pure and spiritual friendship that is love without the hormonal side of things. But this reveals an important element in Thomas Mann German psyche: he cannot imagine any friendship of this type in his society because he would be convicted (in a court of justice if necessary) of improper behavior. Just think of Oscar Wilde. That sure is a masterpiece but its magnitude can only be captured in German. Just try to get it there:[...], many standards available. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

I once read that if you were a true Harry Potter fan, you would have read the books, listened to the recorded books, and watched the movies.  I haven't read this book the old fashioned way, but I can say that this audible version is over the top.  When they say that this is a \"special edition\" they mean it. I am possibly an unlikely fan --a middle aged woman in several book clubs reading historical fiction, old classics and award winning literature only.  I went rogue and returned to my roots of late -- this is my true love genre.  Neil Gaiman, and especially this particular book,  can't be boxed into any set category... but in general, the magical, thriller, other worldly and dark-ish one.  I'm sorry, but he is a genius.  Plain and simple.  About 19 hours of listening - and I almost couldn't turn it off.  I can't believe I took such a long hiatus from reading his books.  The silver lining is that I get to go back and catch up. Thank you for American Gods Neil Gaiman -- I'm back, and I  love it!",

Perhaps because it was perpetrated by the Americans and the British.  The title had kept me from reading this for years until I found out why it was so named.

         "This was Okay. I will keep in mind that this is a children's book but I do want to be honest because I definitely thought this was a promising child/adult series. I am not sure that I myself would read past this installment of the series though I am REALLY curious and want to keep going. I only say that i don't want to continue because somewhere along the line i was reading and not retaining. I got bored. This is a self thing i know but it happens. So this installment in my opinion was a little less on the violent side of things than the 1st one. However I thought that it would have been a teeny bit scary if I was a kid. In this book Simon comes back and he is not really a good guy anymore. He is set on destroying his sister, the extraordinary wizard and his baby brother. I get the way that Simon feels because I am the first child myself but I am pretty sure its kind of rude to go around using darke magyck to try and annihilate your siblings. Also Marcia isn't herself and its a little scary. Septimus from book 1 has grown so much and has learned more about himself which is great but he ends up going on an adventure to save his sister alone. Yes, he takes Nicko with him but they are kids!! So they get into a great amount of trouble trying to find Jenna and then also when they actually do find her. It was a little harrowing if you remember for a second that these are kids. So other than the obvious danger and potential death - this was fun. We learned a great many things. We finally saw the Queens room, Simon finally does accept that he is related to septimus, the mystery of grandpa Heap is solved along with the weirdness of the green rock that Sep is carrying. Oh! And we learn about wolf boy! That was interesting! I really hope that things work out for that guy. All in all - Its 50/50 with me.",

His first stop was Trieste, which he detested, so, bathed in memories from his past, he sets off for Venice, a city the romantic qualities of which begin to set off the emotional explosion which becomes the soul of this magnificent novella. Gustav becomes fixated and obsessed with a 14 year old Polish boy, Tadizo, who is vacationing with his mother and sisters at the same hotel where he, Gustav, is staying....Over the course of the the second half of this tale, Gustav becomes ever more obsessed with the young man - an obsession which gradually takes such complete control of his entire life that every other dimension of his selfhood is completely and totally effaced. In the end, this is the story of the progressive domination and destruction of a personality built on one ideal (Apollonistic) that is totally taken down by the chaotic Dionysian forces and powers that inhabit us all. Nothing less than a masterpiece.",

         "Writing his novels, Vonnegut is weaving a single mosaic, his own cats cradle of mans limitations.  Woven from the gossamer of mans futility, it is a web which, as the spiders, defines neither the meaning nor the escape from an existence he neither controls nor comprehends.  Individually and collectively, his novels are to be read as a sequence of  brief urgent messages with no beginnings, no ends, no suspense, no morals, no causes, no effects, butan image of life that is beautiful, surprising, and deep.  Vonnegut is, has been, and always will be inscribing a single punctuation mark - the period which ends historys apocalyptic sentence. To fully appreciate any Vonnegut novel it must be understood as one part of a continuum. Read Cats Cradle, the read Galapagos.  See the cat, see the cradle, see the island, see the hubris. Chronology matters.  The metaphors vary, but the template remains.  Cats Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five are best read in tandem.  Both tell his story  the fire bombing of Dresden, but you have to read Cats Cradle as anti-matter (fire is ice), Slaughterhouse-Five as matter (fire is fire).  See Slaughterhouse-Five as a photograph, Cats Cradle as the negative. After Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut promises to set all his characters free.  In Galapalagos, he resurrects a few, though with brand new names.  Read carefully, he retells the story of Cats Cradle,  - different metaphor, same theme. In both, Vonnegut telescopes historys kaleidoscope of apocalypse into a single surreal archetype,  macrocosm into microcosm.  In Galapalagos,  Vonnegut sets himself free, satirizing himself, his writing, his fans, thumbing his nose at you know who. Galapagos is a must tongue in cheek read for the Vonnegut aficiando.",

         "Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five certainly looks a lot different to me than it did ten years ago back in UMKC. For one, I thought postmodernist literature was just some yuppie terminology for a new writing trend. I didn't know that it was something I've been doing as an author all along. Granted, I found Billy Pilgrim's rambling narratives as annoying as those of Ray Bradbury's Montag in Fahrenheit 451 (which I'm now reading as well). It just goes to show what happens when you don't take time to stop and smell the roses on the cactus bush. Vonnegut's editors should have warned him that his 'time travel' gimmick with the Tralfamadorians was like running with scissors, and it ended up getting the story shot to spit. If he would have approached the Dresden holocaust with the reverence shown by Dalton Trumbo in Johnny Got His Gun, this could have been one of the greatest anti-war books ever written. Instead, we get these metaphors for hallucinatory flashbacks that, like the flying saucers, sailed right over the heads of most folk. Took me a whole decade to go back and look for this frisbee. Billy Pilgrim's Kafkaesque gift for understatement and depressive ennui make this a work of genius just as much as it can easily put off its audience. It's almost impossible to like this guy, but if you can hang in long enough to let Vonnegut show you what (or what doesn't) make him tick, this can turn into a compelling postmodernist read.",

         "Thomas Mann's Death in Venice tells the tale of a successful German writer who takes a holiday in Venice, falls in love from afar with a little boy, the child of a vacationing Polish family, contracts cholera and dies. The writer uses imagery from Greek mythology throughout the novella to describe his erotic infatuation with the boy. Ironically he actually begins to leave but uses a mix-up over lost and returned luggage as an excuse to stay at the resort and to continue to clandestinely adore the child.  Even when he discovers that Venice is undergoing an outbreak of a deadly strain of cholera, he decides to stay to be in sight of the boy.  He writes a philosophical page about aesthetics, how beauty allows humankind to comprehend truth and divinity. On the day the Polish family is packed and preparing to leave, he sees the boy one last time walking in the ocean.  The boy appears to to beckon to him, and the German writer falls out of his beach chair and dies. The entire narrative takes place in the mind of the writer and was for me a combination of a chaste version of Nabokov's Lolita and one of the half hour screenplays of Alfred Hitchcock Presents in the 1950's.  I read the novella in one sitting and thought to myself when the German expired, \"This is what Western sensibilities would be like if ancient Greek mores informed modern Western aesthetics and eroticism.\"",

         "It is interesting to see how people respond to stories differently. Here is another work of literatre that does not engage me emotionally, but is fascinating as a work of art. Mann the author as well as the narrator seemed to desire the reader to maintain a critical distance from the main character rather than to identify and sympathize with him. Readers interested in a romantic experience, being wrapped up in the story, transported away from their mundane lives, and so on had probably better turn elsewhere. But readers willing or eager to work out a complicated allegory of the artist's quest for perfection will appreciate this cerebral work. I suppose I've said enough; I don't intend to summarize the plot and I'm not sure I can offer a very insightful interpretation of the allegory yet. I'm probably a couple readings away from being able to do that. It's enough for now to alert prospective readers that the bare plot is not the heart of the matter, that this story is really all about its symbolism and the intellectual experience you will have working it out rather than the emotional experience you will have identifying with the joys and pains of the characters: most people probably won't, and I'd like to relieve you of the obligation of trying to. If you do have a strong reaction, it probably won't be pleasant. Either way, you will get a lot more out of the work if you keep its intellectual project in mind. The one thing I can say is that the Norton Critical Edition is more than satisfactory for me. I might pick up another edition sometime; I'm interested in the introduction that so offended other readers. But the NCE comes with a few very nice little essays, so if you think you might read them I'd say it's worth the trouble to seek it out. Finally, I'd suggest reading The Magic Mountain first. Although it is at least ten times as long as Death in Venice, I think most readers will enjoy it more, and on more levels; regardless of enjoyment, I'd frankly argue that The Magic Mountain is a more complete work of art and a more important cultural and intellectual experience. That kind of comparison may not be welcome to some people: by all means, read both in either order and make up your own mind! However, if you're only going to read one, read TMM; and if you haven't liked DiV, read TMM nevertheless. (And more than once!)",

         "When nature collides with corporate greed, and mysticism in the form of Santeria is tossed into the mix, the result is an exciting and entertaining supernatural thriller by Michael Gruber. Night of the Jaguar is the final installment in a trilogy that began with Tropic of Night and Valley of Bones. Each of the three Gruber novels feature Jimmy Paz, a Miami police detective. In Night of the Jaguar, Paz has retired from the police department and works in his mother's Cuban restaurant. He has married psychologist Lorna Wise and is raising his young daughter. Miami businessmen are dying horrific deaths and the police are puzzled by the lack of clues (other than the huge, catlike footprints that appear at each murder). Paz is brought out of retirement to help the police solve the unsolvable crimes. With Paz's involvement in the murders, he and his daughter Amelia begin to dream about huge jungle cats. And as Paz begins his investigation, he discovers an Indian, Moie, newly arrived to the United States from an area of Colombia that the victims planned to develop. Moie is taken in by Jenny Simpson and her band of environmental activists, and Paz wants to know what his connection is to the murders. The more involved Paz becomes in the case, the closer the danger comes to him and his family. His own daughter's life could hang in the balance if he doesn't solve the murders. Armchair Interviews says: Night of the Jaguar is a fascinating look at the mystical and those who practice it. If you enjoy supernatural thrillers, you'll love Gruber's Night of the Jaguar.",

We get into the head of the main character in a brilliant manner as only Thomas Mann could take us.  Astounding!!!

One of them is Jimmy Paz's father, from whom he is long estranged. This is a terrific shamanic thriller.

It continues the story of Jimmy Paz' life, career(s), and loves. As before, Paz is a wonderfully rich and interesting character - a black Cuban ex-cop who now cooks for his mom's wonderful restaurant, and is father to a wonderfully engrossing little girl. Like the two previous Jimmy Paz novels, this one combines the multiple story lines of several very different - and very well-drawn - characters.  But it does these similar things in ways that make it completely unique from the other two novels in the series (so far...) Two of the major characters are a young, uneducated hippie girl, and a shaman from a small tribe in the depths of the rainforest. Gruber brings the reader right into the minds of these wildly various characters, giving  the thoughtful reader plenty of points of view of the same circumstances... This is an exciting, warm, thought-provoking tale. I desperately hope that this is not the last of the Jimmy Paz novels! I hope to hear of more... I will buy and read every one!!!",

This caused me to not understand the plot, and I quit reading the series. Now at the age of 12, after I saw my friend reading it, I decided to give it another go. The books blew me away. So much detail, the characters are facinating. There are so many interesting characters in this story, including a long lost princess, a cat that was turned into a duck, a mother who has lost her seventh son, a mysterious boy from a army camp, a spy next door, and a malicious villian. The plot is well written, this is a good read for anyone who loved Harry Potter! I love how this story keeps you at the edge of your seat, and just as you think the character is safe, a new problem emerges. The names of the characters and things are unique and hard to forget, like Septimus, Beetle, Rhubarb lumps, Banana bears, and Marcia Overstrand. Anyone who loves fantasy would enjoy this book. There are dragons, ghosts, wizards, spirits, and of course, Magyk. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of seven, only because it is a bit hard to follow with all the characters if you are that young. Overall, I give this book a five star rating because it was a terrific read. I loved the characters, the suspense, and the plot. Once again, I highly recommend this to HARRY POTTER FANS.

If a review is in order at this point in time (thirty-six years after its publication) it ought not deal with its merit, that's a given, but should address some aspect of the work that makes it relevant today. At a time when our country is war-logged, tired to death of the war in Afghanistan, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" reminds us of all that is wrong with depending on the military to sort out the world's problems. Billy Pilgrim, the hapless World War II Chaplin's Assistant whose experiences toward the end of the war are at the center of Vonnegut's tale, could not have been less suited for active duty. Separated from his unit virtually from the time he reached the front at the Battle of the Bulge, he never got his bearings and soon came to grief. Hurting, in way over his head, Pilgrim wanted to be left to die, but couldn't manage even that.  Roland Weary, a buddy, refused to leave him behind, and bullied him along.  When captured, Weary and Pilgrim were in such sad shape that their captors published photographs of them \"as heartening evidence of how miserably equipped the American Army often was.\"  Vonnegut, whose actual World War II service provided much of the raw material for the book, never lets the reader forget the reasons for his antiwar views. These become most clear in the account of the aftermath of the bombing raid on Dresden, the centerpiece of the book. In gross violation of the rules of war, the raid was designed to immolate Dresden's civilian population in the course of burning the city to the ground. Winston Churchill is said to have approved the raid because he wanted to deal with Stalin at the upcoming Yalta Conference from a position of strength. The fact that adverse weather conditions delayed the planned attack until after Yalta did not persuade Churchill to back off. The great old city of Dresden, a place of no military value, one which the Red Cross considered an open city, i.e.  one that would not be bombed, was wiped out. Billy Pilgrim was part of a small group of American prisoners who were housed (as Vonnegut had been) in a deep underground meat locker, Slaughterhouse-Five, away from the city center. It is where Pilgrim (and Vonnegut) spent the night of the bombing. \"There were sounds like giant footsteps above. . . . There was a fire-storm out there. Dresden was one big flame. The one flame ate everything organic, everything that would burn. . . . When the Americans and their guards did come out [the next day], the sky was black with smoke. The sun was an angry little pinhead. Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals. The stones were hot. Everybody else in the neighborhood was dead. So it goes.\" For practical purposes, this gut-wrenching account was for a great many Americans their first accurate look at what had happened to Dresden at the hands of our Eighth Air Force. \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" not only revealed the extent of the atrocity, it makes clear Vonnegut's contempt for our government's efforts to conceal it from us. As Vonnegut writes \"Even then [back in the days fairly soon after the War] I was supposedly writing a book about Dresden. It wasn't a famous air raid back then in America. Not many Americans knew how much worse it had been than Hiroshima, for instance. I didn't know that either. There hadn't been that much publicity.\" See the End Note. Vonnegut uses the phrase \"so it goes\" to emphasize the finality of death.  It appears at least 84 times in the book including the one quoted above. The editors of the 2009 Dial Press trade paper edition missed a great chance to use it to good purpose in the brief biographical note on the book's back cover. It ends: \"Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.\" If Vonnegut had been alive to compose that note, he would have added \"so it goes.\" End Note. Midway through Chapter 9 of \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" the narrator, alter ego for the author, states \"the thing was, though, there was almost nothing in the 27 volumes [of the \"Official History of the Army Air Force in World War Two\"] about the Dresden raid, even though it was a howling success.\" So true. The account of operations for the night of February13-14 simply says \"461 B17s are dispatched to hit the marshaling yard at Dresden (311).\" The number in parenthesis apparently refers to the number of targets destroyed in the marshaling yard-- a place where\"railway [cars] are shunted and made up into trains and where engines, carriages, etc. are kept when not in use.\" Contrast that with the account of operations in the Pacific on August 6, 1945: \"The world's first atomic attack takes place. . . . At 0915 hours (0815 hours Japan time) the atomic bomb is released over Hiroshima from 31,600 feet (9,632 meters), it explodes 50 seconds later. 80+% of the city's buildings are destroyed and over 71,000 people (Japanese figures say from 70,000 to 80,000) are killed.\"",

Vonnegut does have some creative ideas, such as in this case, the use of non-linear time.  He also makes good ethical points, such as the awful suffering and pointlessness of war.  You can tell he has had some creative thoughts, it just isn't enough. The main problem with his books is that they are so two dimensional.  Everthing is a list of what is happening, there is no insight into any of the characters.  One never really know why they did anything that they did.  Without this, there is no means for becoming vested in the story.  One does not care what happens to the characters, even the main ones.  If they die, they were only a detail in the book anyway, they were not real people. Also, he needs to stop saying \"so it goes\" so much.  A couple times may be \"poetic\", but a hundred times is repetitive and annoying.  Maybe he was trying to highlight the pointlessness of death, but there must be a better way of doing so. In the end, not the worst book I've read.  It was easy to read and flowed well.  I'd say possibly better for a younger crowd, such as high school.  I just never cared what happened and was glad when it was done.  And so it went...",

         "This is considered a classic and deservedly so. It is almost equal parts anti-war novel and science fiction, and is thoroughly enjoyable. There's never a dull moment and there are some very interesting ideas to take away. Many of those ideas are conveyed by means of the Tralfamadorians, the aliens who abduct the book's main character. Yes, the book's main character, Billy Pilgrim, gets abducted by aliens and then proceeds to tell others about it. His daughter tries to get him to stop. But at one point in the future, others actually listen to Billy and believe him. Yes, Billy Pilgrim also travels in time. Unlike most sci-fi stories of time travel, in this case Billy has no control over when he time-travels and to what point in time he travels to. As a result, we learn about things which occurred well after World War II before we learn all the details of the war. It's a very interesting way of telling the story. The main focus of the World War II portion is the bombing of Dresden by the Allied forces late in the war. Billy Pilgrim was among prisoners of war who were being kept at Dresden when the bombing happened. The narrator of the story (who is not Billy himself) was also at Dresden. The attack is the centerpiece for illustrating how awful war is - a beautiful city transformed into a barren wasteland reminiscent of the surface of the moon. Much is also made of the condition of the soldiers on both sides, with many soldiers seemingly too young or too old for war and none able to remain healthy. Besides anti-war messages, some of the most interesting ideas are the result of Billy's time travel and abduction by the Tralfamadorians. The Tralfamadorians live in four dimensions and are able to see any moment in time all the time. According to them, you never really die, you just visit different moments of your life constantly (similar to Billy's time travel). As a result they don't believe in free will - whatever happens will happen and nobody can change it. One idea they propose that humans could learn from is that since life is full of good and bad moments, it is often best to focus on the good ones.",

In regards to the organization of a congregation, this book was a valuable resource.  The best insights from this book was the role of the business owner.  The business owner works the business, much in the same way that the minister works in the congregation.  This is why congregations that have a pastoral mindset stop growing at 200 members.  The minister cannot do anymore for the people.  He is maxed out.  The next step is that the minister works harder, helps the congregation grow, but than there is conflict.  He no longer can be at everything, people expect him at everything, and there are hurt feelings.  The same quality of service is no longer there.  Disappointment sets in.  People leave, and the congregation falls back to the normal size.  This book helps you think through these issues.  Instead of just working in the business, you need to work on the business.  This is probably the biggest shift for a preacher.  We are trained to work in, and not on.  One of the best steps for a successful business is building a system that can be duplicated.  This means understanding who is doing what.  If you do not have a flow chart, or an organizational chart, you have a mob, and mobs destroy things.  This is a good book for understanding how an organization works.  Everything might not line up with how a church works, but there is a lot of good advice, and a good read for the topic.

Vonnegut provided many laughs throughout, and maybe if I was paying closer attention the whole way I would have gotten more out of this. The key message does seem to be to not fret about the petty things in life. Billy Pilgrim is a crusader when it comes to not letting things get under his skin, in fact, other people actually get upset with his insane ability to not give a hoot.

         "This is the first time I have read anything by Angie Sage.  Overall, I felt the book was enjoyable (if a little predictable at times) and will read Book 2 to see what happens to this delightful cast of characters. The characters really drive this story.  You feel for Silas and Sarah Heap, who are introduced as young parents and develop into parents who are struggling to keep their family together.  They have fostered a girl who came to them as a foundling infant, just as their seventh son was prounounced dead on the day he was born. The girl is kind and intelligent, and loves her family, so you see a lot of dynamics at work when the story begins to unfold.  All of the ancilliary characters are also interesting - Boy 412 grows in importance as the book goes on, and Nicko becomes a solid and dependable companion.  Aunt Zelda, Marcia, Alther, the rat...so many characters that keep the book interesting and help develop history and context for the story.  All in all, I think the author did a great job of tying together the history and multiple stories into one, through the use of her characters. Why did I subtract one star?  Well, I would have only subtracted 1/2 star if I could.  I did feel that the story began to plod a little in the middle.  There was enough information to work out some of the mysteries by then, but the story seemed to slow down, with all the characters remaining in the dark.  It picks up the pace again at the end, and has a touching \"big reveal\" that leaves you feeling satisfied that you stuck it out to the finish.  But I had my doubts, for a while.",

However, as Akkarian slowly tries to expose Sonea to the reasons behind his choices, Sonea begins to understand, and even agrees to help Akkarian. Sonea has to make some very difficult choices throughout this book, dissapointing Rothen and others she respects; and yet she never wavers. She is strong mentally and magically, and challenges the other magicians to see the truth that they ignore, and the consequenses on their actions.  I loved seeing the character development of Akkarian, and the easing of his cold facade.  He became my favorite charahter! The interaction between the two magicians during their journey together is rather amusing, and touching.  I was SO MAD at the ending of this book, and yet I also loved it. I don't know what the other reader who said there was no big BANG at the end was talking about, but I thought it had plenty of OMPFH!  I highly recommend this book, along with the previous BMT books.

Canavan answered all the questions she'd previously raised as well as some she presented in this final chapter. Sonea finally comes to understand the larger picture of the happenings in the kingdom of Kyralia. What is more she is able to make a positive contribution with her magic. Though Canavan used some elements that are as common as the Coke jingle to create her melody the song she composes is enjoyable. However some of the melody lines were a duplication of effort as several of the characters trace the same steps that Sonea takes at the beginning of the book. More positively, the book ends on its own note without the common final melody presented in so many stories. All in all, Canavan's \"The High Lord\" is an uplifting end to a symphony that began rather slowly.",

He's absolutely right about that. The reason why McDonald's and other successful franchises work is because they have a tried and proven formula - in other words, a system.  The point is that when starting a new business or revamping one that isn't working, putting in place a system on which everything runs like clockwork is the way to go.

They don't pay attention to the details and they don't work on their business. Gerber goes on to explain that the problem is not that these business owners don't work hard but that they are doing the wrong work. Every owner must have a clear understanding of what is going on in their business.

In one sense it breaks all the rules of writing and sets itself apart. The author has been true to his own vision and shows the reader the fluidity of the mind of a person who has endured shellshock and has post traumatic stress disorder -- the moving in and out of time in what appear to be alternately flashbacks (the war) and hallucinations (abduction by aliens). It further addresses the horror of the Allied bombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II -- to our shame. I told my grandson to imagine that someone had just knocked on the door and ordered him to go to war. How would he feel? That's the point of view of this book. A young man is conscripted and sent to war. What does he fear? How does he view the daily life of war? Because Kurt Vonnegut was himself a prisoner in the slaughterhouse converted into a prison, his writing is that more realistic about what he witnessed in Dresden through the eyes of his protagonist. Because of the slipping in and out of time, it can be a bit confusing, especially for a young reader, but one adapts to share this amazing journey of memories and discoveries.",

         4,
         "Kurt Vonnegut, the narrator, wants to write a book about the World War 2 bombing of Desden, Germany.  He focuses his narrator on one soldier, Billy Pilgrim, who happens to time travel and was abducted by aliens for display in a zoo on the planet Tralfamador.  Billy's time travel involves constantly slipping into different moments in his life.  One moment he will be a prisoner of war in Dresden, the next he will be a middle-aged optometrist, twenty years later, and after he will be back in the trenches, pre-capture.  This time travel is the basis for a non-linear narrative structure where the futility of the war is told in parallel with much other futility.  The time travel aspect makes Billy an observer of his life, not an actor.  (In consultation, the only other novel I could identify with a similar narrative structure is&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Time-Traveler-s-Wife/dp/015602943X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>.)  Vonnegut, through all this, teaches the absurdity of war, but the novel is also crammed with trippy tributaries: For example, Billy Pilgrim reads a science fiction novel about a man who travels back in time to verify whether the Messiah actually died on the cross or not.  And in the zoo on Tralfamador, Pilgrim has a child with a Hollywood starlet. (This actually leads to the one inconsistency I found in the novel.  The Tralfamadorians teach that human reproduction, in ways we do not understand, relies not on only a man and a woman but also on the existence of gay men, elderly women, babies who have died, and others.  And yet, Billy and his Hollywood lover are able to reproduce on Tralfamador despite the fact that they are - as far as we know - the only humans on the planet.  Perhaps a minor inconsistency, but otherwise everything seems to make sense, in its way.) Vonnegut - zikhrono livrakha - fought in World War 2, so he knows some of what he speaks.  Ethan Hawke's reading of the audiobook is strong. Note on content: The book has strong language scattered throughout, and it has a number of references to sex although no graphic scenes.",

The ending of Magyk suggested that future books in the series would feature Septimus more, so I jumped right into the second book (which I soon thereafter put down without finishing because of the boredom that it inflicted).",

The characters were all interesting, and the world was fairly fresh as far as fantasy worlds go. There's actually not a lot else to say, as it's a fairly simple book. It is written for children, but it is enjoyable to adults (or at least this one). The plot had a little \"surprise,\" but I figured it out a while before. That didn't take any enjoyment out. One of my favorite things was being able to get narration from many creatures. From human to shield bug, you got to see a little bit of their world. It was fantastic! One somewhat bothersome thing had to do with the words themselves oddly enough. Any word that was related to magic was bold. That could take you out of the story a bit. However, I found that to be a minor thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun story in a fascinating world.",

         "Ordinary Wizard Silas Heap discovers a baby girl while returning to his family home. With the loss of his own son (and under instructions from ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia), Heap brings the girl into his family and raises her. Times are tough, however, especially for wizards. The Queen has been assassinated and the city taken over by evil forces who are trying to wipe out wizards and raising an army of young boys to obey their every command. Although Silas tries to keep the girl a secret, eventually Jenna is discovered--as princess and legitimate heir to the thrown. Chased by an evil Hunter, Silas, Jenna, assorted Heap family members, Marcia and one of the young army soldiers Marcia has rescued make their escape. Marcia's magic can protect them to a certain extent, but the evil powers are strong--and soon Marcia is the ex-ExtraOrdinary Wizard. Final control depends on getting Jenna and when Marcia is captured, it looks like the end. Author Angie Sage follows a familiar path in this fantasy and beginning of a series. The secret princess, the supposedly dead but surely still living (as the series is named after him) Septimus Heap, seventh son of a seventh son, the evil Hunter and magical overlord all call fairy tales to mind. In a book targeting younger readers, walking the familiar road isn't that much of a liability--after all, young readers like the assurance of the known and safe. For me, the bigger problem is that the action isn't driven by the protagonists at all. Jenna and Boy 412 huddle in a cottage in the swamp, waiting, while the evil forces plot (ineffectually). With Jenna and Boy 412 spending most of their time waiting (and Boy 412 only starts talking in the last few pages of the story), we're left with a messenger rat as the most sympathetic and active character--and he's used by the evil overlord. MAGYK isn't a bad book--it's competently written, with some funny description, an interesting character in Marcia, a tragic figure in 'the apprentice' and the kind of safe danger that young readers will resonate with. I don't think it's the kind of books that will create the cross-over appeal with adult readers the way the Harry Potter series did.",

So go figure when I want to try this book again I can't find my original copy. I bought the book again and it was completely worth it. While the writing was a bit slow and the plot dry in some areas, when I was finished I loved it and immediately bought the sequel. My favorite part is the way Angie Sage spells magic--Magyk. I read on her website that she got this from the old spelling of the word, when English writing didn't have many rules. I loved Marcia Overstrand especially, even more in the following books. I recommend this book to anyone who likes magic, fantasy, and fiction. Enjoy!",

I like fantasy and read YA because sometimes the story is more  imaginative than books geared for adults.  Kids are great at suspending disbelief and great kids' authors know how to capture the imagination.  All that being said, this book was not Magykal to me.  It was not terrible by any means and I certainly did not hate it.  I thought it had some fun points and interesting characters (loved the Dragon Boat).  But I felt like I'd read the story before and could generally predict how things were going to turn out. I mean I knew who Boy 412 was about 5 minutes after he was introduced.  It was maddening that it took so long for his big reveal.  At any rate, this is probably fun for young kids but not, in my opinion, for teens or adults.  I won't be reading the next ones.",

The magyk in this book was completely different from the magic in Harry Potter, seeing that in Harry Potter the magic is something that people are picked for and then taught, but in Magyk the magyk came from objects that had spells written on them. It was very different, but a good different.   The only thing that I didn't like too much was that, even though you know who Septimus is during almost the entire book, it isn't until the very end that we find out for sure.

Yes, he has some things that are not the same, but it would be nice if he was not the average mentor.

         "This series is often compared to Harry Potter, but I think in many ways it's much different. The only parallels that I see are that it involves a boy, who at one point is an orphan, and magic. Definitely written for a younger audience, the Septimus books have a tendency to be a little silly sometimes and the endings easily resolved. However, in contrast, Sage deftly creates an interesting world with often odd and humorous characters who have the ability to surprise the reader. The plot structures of each story vary, and, to any fantasy reader's great joy, she doesn't use the same antagonist throughout every single book. Some of the characters switch sides, and other, new bad guys emerge as the series progresses. Also, unlike many series writers, Sage will start a chain of events that last throughout several books, continuing to hook readers from book to book. She does not wrap everything up neatly, but is still able to finish a book in a way that makes the story seem complete. Then, the reader has the anticipation of discovering how some of the issues that arise in earlier books will unravel in later additions. Within this book specifically is a prime example of a complicated plot structure and set of characters that break the far too often tread mold of fantasy novels. The main bad guy is a Queen named Etheldredda, who is now a ghost attempting to live forever. However, another `bad guy' of this book is her son, Marcellus Pye who kidnaps Septimus from 500 years in the past. However, in order to create three-dimensional characters, Marcellus is shown throughout the book to be kind and fiercely intelligent, winning Septimus's admiration and trust even though he doesn't want to be back in time. Far too often, the antagonists are simply evil and have nothing more to them. It certainly makes the reading more interesting when there are levels of good and evil, and not everyone has to be simply one or the other. Even Simon, who was the bad guy in the previous book, seems to be coming around because of Lucy's influence. I recommend this to all readers 9+, skewing more toward boys. -Lindsey Miller, [...]",

         "I saw a few magazines when I was in Vietnam. I spent a week in Cambodia before coming home in 1970. The novel I wanted to read most was Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five. Being drafted for service in the American army was part of a global strategy maintained for superpower purposes, and the limited warfare I took part in with a few free fire zones and secret CIA armies in neighboring countries were minor matters compared to the idea that a real war would allow us to wipe out everything we hate. Opinion polls about fighting godless Commies used unpopular as a euphemism for what many people would not allow to be printed in newspapers. In introducing Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut asked some questions of the US Air Force that got a response covering the bombing of Dresden with secrecy. Cambodia had been bombed in ways that were not revealed when Nixon claimed in 1970: Up to this point, we have scrupulously respected the sanctity of international borders. Books seemed like the best way to turn war inside out. I have read many books that other people consider obscure because books reveal human aspects of behavior that are not what anybody thinks openly. Books that have been published after the death of an author can reveal what only a fool would admit. The goal of self-overcoming that Nietzsche tried to make a style of transvaluation of all values when he was preparing his last works digs much deeper than comedy into the way a mind can find paths in thinking that has become twisted because it is never the same time. Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time. The entire history of religion, philosophy, anthropology, and any expectations of an end of the world have been hopping back and forth between such weird alternatives that the idea of a learning curve with a money mudslide wiping out society keeps hopping back and forth until nobody knows what shoe to expect on the other foot the next time around.

         5,
         "I recently read this book for the second time. Galapagos, like most of Vonnegut's novels, is a tribute to the complexities and boundless horizons of human imagination. Here we have a boat full of humans, well not that many, cast adrift after the start of a huge, colossal, worldwide financial collapse, accompanied by a war and a million other social upheavals.  In the middle of it is the \"Cruise of the Century,\" originally to be a luxury cruise to the Galapagos Islands for a select few of the ostensibly rich and famous.  A middle class school teacher manages to make the list, evidence that anything is possible, and that is good. Somehow, in spite of his navigational ineptitude, the incompetent Ecuadorian captain manages to wash the boat ashore on one of the Galapagos Islands, which the school teacher, from her studies of Darwin's finches, correctly identifies, and where they are the progenitors of the new human race, which won't need \"big brains,\" or even hands for that matter.  Evolution will have perfected the human being into the body of a seal. Seals don't need much to survive.  Just eyes with which to hunt, sleek bodies to part the waters, flippers with which to hold raw fish, and mouths with which to feed.  Vonnegut points the way toward a simpler, sleeker, future, in which \"mankind\" has collective bad breath from catching and eating live fish. Full of all sorts of quotes, from all sorts of great people, but perhaps Vonnegut says it best.  This book is a testament to the great imagination and sense of humor that the late Kurt Vonnegut embodied.  Five Stars.  Check it out!",

         "American Gods by Neil Gaiman This book has an interesting premise regarding godhood.  Forbidden Planet was the earliest science fiction movie I can recall.  I  saved Quaker Oats coupons to get a free ticket.  Succinctly the villain in the movie is the physical manifestations of the thoughts and fears of the characters in the movie.  In other  words, what they thought or feared became real.  American Gods are gods who have been created by their believers.  The old gods came from the old country.  The new gods are those created by what is currently worshipped such as technology or beauty.  The premise of the book is the conflict between the old gods and the new gods. Shadow is the main protagonist who is ignorant of his conceptional roots.  He is taciturn, large and strong.  He faces many changes and makes many strange friends.  Shadow finds himself being manipulated not only  by those he loves but some he doesn't even realize exists. The book questions the underpinnings of faith and what leads to worship.  The plot is intricate and occasionally confusing.  You often find yourself wondering where am I and what is Gaiman trying to say. The book is worth reading and if you are not a fan, I suggest continuing to read anyway as you may become a fan.  The book is a re-release possibly because it is now being produced as a TV series. I recommend the book.",

         "\"But brains back then were so big that they could actually deceive their owners.\"",
         5,
         "The villain of the story is shared by all the human characters; their big brains. Big brains cause humans to pass their lives away conducting \"experiments with unlimited greed and ambition\" (p. 185). If all of Vonnegut's exaggerated characters, imaginative scenarios, and striking insights were peeled away, I think the fundamental question of the book is \"if our brains are so great how did they get us in so much trouble?\"  He acknowledges that the human brain created symphonies the mandarax (language transcriber that also provides appropriate quote for any occasion) but is it worth the cost of also creating war, poverty, psychopathology and torture? For Vonnegut, evolution has made a huge mistake and Mary Hepburn, a retired school teacher, is the heroine that can set humanity back on the right course. A course towards smaller brains and fingerless fins.  For Vonnegut, this convoluted approach to evolution is not without precedent in the wild... he points out the cormorants of the Galapagos Islands, who sacrificed flight for the getting of fish. Vonnegut moves the story along thanks to his manipulation of time. The reader is alternatively provided glimpses into the past, present and future and distant future. The bits and pieces are just enough to pique curiosity about how things will finish up. By the end of the book, past and future meet in a crescendo of revelations. Foreshadowing, thanks to Leon Trout, is actually 20-20 hind-sight. In typical Vonnegut style, narrator is capable of entering the story as he pleases. Not much is shared about Leon until the end of the story. However, without giving the ending away to any prospective readers, I would point out that my favorite part of the book is when Leon confronts his father about entering the \"blue tunnel.\" Other favorite parts included the quotes of the mandarax and Vonnegut's descriptions of various Galapagos inhabitants' idiosyncratic survival schemes. Leon Trout made this comment about the marine iguana's stew pot strategy: \"During the million years I have spent in these islands, the Law of Natural Selection has found no way to improve, or for that matter, worsen this particular survival scheme.\"  Similarly, Mary Hepburn points to the blue footed boobies mating dance as completely unrelated to any survival scheme. She then poses the question \"Dare we call it `religion?' As a guy that has read a whole lot of Kurt Vonnegut, my one knock against him is that, especially as he got older, he takes a pretty dismal stance on humanity. One of his earlier books, \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\" had a virtuous perspective of humanity and promotes philanthropy. The moral seemed to be of we could just care about everybody, even the average folk, then everything will be okay. In Galapagos, and his subsequent novels, such as \"Timequake\" and \"A Man Without a Country\" he comes across as a bitter curmudgeon. The stance that human race is a lost cause does not resonate with me. However, he tells a great a tale and makes you think along the way. Overall, Galapagos is a worthy use of your big brain!",

At birth, Septimus Heap is announced dead on arrival, and his father arrives home with a surprise - a baby girl, abandoned in the snow outside the walls of their city.  The Heaps, with 6 children already, welcome and raise the child as their own, although most are able to tell from her appearance that the child is different from her brothers.  Fast forward to ten years later, the girl, named Jenna, narrowly escapes an assassination attempt.  She finds out that she is the only child of a murdered queen, and must take the realm in hand to save it from the former Supreme Custodian (thought dead) - who has wrestled the position away from the current custodian because she is busy saving the princess from an assassination attempt.  Along this journey she picks up a few stragglers, namely Boy 412, who almost froze to death in the snow outside the magician's castle.  The characters are well-developed (IMO) and entertaining, although there are a lot of them.  There are a lot of journeys for the different characters and surprises and humor are included.

         "Deadeye Dick is unmistakably a Kurt Vonnegut book. With its meandering storyline, beautiful asides, funny and cynical writing, and memorable characters, there's no way this could be written by anyone other than Vonnegut, and much of the joy of the book comes from just enjoying Vonnegut's style. That being said, Deadeye is also one of Vonnegut's weaker books. The introduction - in which he explains some of his thoughts behind the book and gives some information as to some of the book's symbolism - helps clarify things a bit, but the book never really coalesces much, ultimately just kind of feeling ramshackle and strung together. That's okay, really; Vonnegut has always felt like that, and no one can make that sort of journey more satisfying and enjoyable. And there's definitely no shortage of events here, between a narrator who's an accidental murderer, an exploding neutron bomb, a mysterious decapitation, a Nazi-adoring father, fake painters, and more. It just never really comes together in the end to anything more than a general lament for the slow slipping-away of life, and the lack of focus ultimately leaves you feeling a little disappointed in the book or like you missed the point of it all. So, yeah, it doesn't compare to his best works. But if you're a fan, you'll enjoy the ride here, minor book and all. It's still funny, still beautifully dry, still delightful, still moving - it's just not all that focused. But it's still a great journey to take.",

Typically, I have not been a fan of science fiction/fantasy books, but let me assure those of you who have not yet read this due to its label, it is far beyond and separated from novels in such a genre.  I had heard of Kurt Vonnegut, but much to my present dismay, had distanced my literary choices from his work.  That has forever changed. \"Billy Pilgram\" has left an impression on me that I may not be able to properly describe.  He is painted to be such a simple and almost uneventful character, that you'd imagine this person to bore you to tears.  However, you will learn that his life is far from simplicity and holds the burdens of heartbreak, insanity (or perhaps, just an overactive imagination that bleeds into his human character?), tolerance of negativities, and nonchalanticity (if I may create a word here), that entices the reader to feel those emotions as if their own.  Billy Pilgram does not ever seem to be confused, regardless of his travels through time and the experiences he is driven to live.  He is comfortable with what he is presented with, most likely due to the fact that he learns about fate and its inevitability.  You'll find yourself questioning your previous interpretation on time, war, imagination/dreams, love... Although, coined into an anti-war mindset, it is not a novel that attempts to draw you into any specific stance.  That aspect alone, is masterfully done.  I wish authors of current affairs would be able to so delicately yet so simply describe their feelings without judgment, persuasion, or controversy. This tale will make you smile, laugh, frown, scratch your head..  The Works.  You'll be pulled into another planet, a war, a marriage...  and may come to the conclusion that time is what we make of it.  It's an entity that we both take for granted and still ponder upon what to do with it.  Fate, destiny, they are much larger than our ability to control, and often times, fighting it or attempting to counteract it, will only yield the same result in the end, after all.

The story slowly comes together and the references and mythology get pieced together. There are a lot of seemingly pointless vignettes, but the main story is very enjoyable. So much detail is put into American Gods by Gaiman to develop a clear picture of modern American and its heritage, but it can get convoluted. I still enjoyed the novel very much and I'm glad to have read it.",

         "What's wonderful about this book is how Vonnegut launches a head-on assault on the mythology of the 20th century's one Good War. History has decreed World War II a Noble Fight Against the Enemies of Civilization, but Vonnegut says it was a freezing firestorm that made a mockery of our very existence.  My late grandfather was also a WWII vet. He never read any Vonnegut that I'm aware of, but he spoke of the war in the same way. I think it had something to with actually being there. Both Vonnegut and my grandfather were grunts sent out to do a dirty goddamn job. Neither of them crowed about a minute of it ever after. That doesn't surprise me. What surprises me is that they both carried on with dignity the rest of their lives, when they'd both seen the beating black heart of the worst horrors man can render upon man. I've always doubted my ability to do the same, and remain thankful to this day that I've never had to find out. Vonnegut's anti-war screed has, if anything, only gained in prescience over time. (See Iraq, War in.) Makes you wish the Decider-in-Chief read books. At least this one. The strange advice (albeit dished out by aliens who see Time akin to a Rocky Mountain panorama) to ignore what's bad in order to focus on what's good smacks of the reasoning of a man who has reached the end of all reasoning. Who can no longer compose a rationale for man's behavior. The sort of conclusion you might come to, say, if you had survived the firebombing of Dresden. As literature, per se, Vonnegut's light-hearted dalliance with both the English language and the strictures of plot structure cause you to wonder why you spend any time reading books less fun than this. Then you realize that such an ephemeral style washes over you so quickly very little is left when the book is done, other than the sour taste of a moral lesson unwittingly learned. I suspect that was Vonnegut's very point. As a general rule, I loathe literature that attempts to teach me a lesson. But I'll make an exception for Slaughterhouse-Five. Oddly, among all the carnage and contempt, the scene that stood out most in my mind comes near the novel's beginning. The narrator is at an old war buddy's house to discuss plans for his war novel. Old war buddy's wife stomps angrily around the house. Turns out she thinks the narrator is going to write a book about John Wayne fighting the war, when in fact World War II, like all wars, was fought by children. The narrator assures her John Wayne will not be making an appearance in his book. Vonnegut dedicated the book to her. I originally read this in high school. Promptly forgot it. (Ah, youth.) I'm very glad to publicly rectify that oversight right here.",

         "Precocious, smart and funny 9-year old Madeleine is not prepared for the series of events that occur on the Canadian air force base of Centralia in early 60's. No one could have anticipated what would happen. Many years later Madeleine does figure out the surprisingly painful truth. Her father Jack had been transferred back to Canada after having been posted in Germany which he, his beautiful Acadian wife Mimi, older son Mike and Madeleine, his old buddy had loved. Jack had history in Centralia: it was here he learned to fly, and then nearly died in a freak accident, ending his piloting career. At the time he was simply an angry young man but years later he realized the accident probably saved his life because he couldn't fly missions in WWII. Many of the pilots who did fly never made it home alive. MacDonald creates strong settings that feel familiar. The timing and pacing, i.e. Jack being seen in the phone booth by Boucher, the time when Jack waved to Ricky on that fateful day are amazing. The dialogue stands out because it is so normal and mediocre until you listen to the underlying nuances of what is said and NOT said, and what is heard and NOT heard. Innocence and guilt are major themes in The Way the Crow Flies. It seems the girls who remain in class after 3pm protect their parents alls right with our world innocence by not telling them about Mr. March. It definitely takes a village to raise a child but the adults on the base were nave about their childrens lives. Most were good, well-meaning parents but feeling safe and being pre-occupied with the minutia of life they didn't worry about their children. Claire, Grace and Ricky are all innocent but left unprotected. And then there are Jack and Simon. Both are smart and committed to the Canadian Air Force. But theyve been trained to be loyal cogs and do their jobs. (We all know who else were just doing their jobs during WWII!)  Pressured by Simon, Jack is forced to make difficult decisions which have a huge impact on him, the lives of his family and others. The novels main plot is where guilt comes in. What was the moral cost of ramping up the space program in Canada and the US with mass murderers?  The US invited nazi scientists in but didn't allow many Jews from Europe safe haven during the war when our government knew these Jews would face certain death! Outstanding and substantial novel with much food for thought and discussion.",

         "If it weren't for the opening page, this book would seem a dreamy, rich view of the haze of summer, childhood, and family life as recounted by a military family moving back to Canada.  And this masterful writing instantly creates a resonance with anyone who has ever rode out the last days of summer, wondered about making new friends, and settled in after (another) move.  But, like the best books with a murder at the core, this warm feeling is constantly interrupted, with the reader unable to stop wondering how this sense of place and time, and the idyllic will lead us to a corpse.  [WARNING: If you read the back of the book, it will actually spoil a major plot point.  I still don't know why backs of books are written so terribly!!) Also, like the best of them, you know, with an increasing sense of dread, that the characters you've instantly gotten to know, and care about, their lives will change when all is revealed.  When you are given your first clue about the identity of the victim, you exhale, not even realizing how much tension had built up and how so many little innocuous details had grown into suspicion and paranoia. There is enough amazing-ness captured here to make the book murderless---Froelich and Jack discussing the moon while Mimi sings an Acadian folk song in the background., Madeleine getting a ride on a motor scooter, or unpacking her toys.  But, with said murder, the tension builds, along with the head-shaking and denial when you find out increasingly horrible things in regards to people you have grown to care about to a great extent. The epilogue--when everyone has grown up, (epilogue longer than some novels, so let's say, the fourth act, could have easily have been a typically portrayed lesbian explaining why the Man has got her down.  Instead, every incident and word honestly stems and derives from experiences, memories and personality established in the beginning of the book.  Any fiction, where you feel the author is on a soapbox, can stem from character's words or action ineptly formed around the message that is being forced upon you. So, from MacDonald's' skilled pen comes not words, but life, as you, me, and the next person experienced it.  And any direction explored, anything \"alternative\" or rebellious, stems from real people trying to figure out them elves and the world around them, and how tragedy inexplicably tangles the mind, until we have the years, wisdom and strength to unravel it.",

         "There are two words to describe this book:  weird and wonderful.  You could substitute \"quirky\" for weird if you want, because that's what \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is:  a very quirky, oddball adventure through time and space.  And it contains a valuable message if you decide to believe in the Tralfamadore view of things.  I rather like their perspective that because someone was alive at some point then they are ALWAYS living, at least somewhere.  (Though I suppose it's only comforting when you apply that to good people, because that definition also means that Hitler and other evildoers are always living somewhere too.) The novel begins with the author struggling to find a way to tell the story of his experience in World War II as a prisoner of war and witness to the firebombing of Dresden, which took more lives (at least immediately) than the atomic bomb.  He visits a friend and finally turns in a jumbled-up mess to the publisher. This jumbled-up mess is the story of Billy Pilgrim who is (or thinks he is) unstuck in time.  Because of this, his life is in shuffle mode, so to speak, where he randomly shifts from one point in time to another.  At one point he might be standing in a field in Germany during the war, at another he's talking to the Lions club in upstate New York, and at another he's a baby in his mother's arms.  Told chronologically, Billy enters the war near the end, gets captured, witnesses the bombing of Dresden, gets repatriated after the war, marries a large, rich woman named Valencia, has a couple kids, runs a successful optometry business, and gets taken to the Tralfamadore homeworld to be put in a zoo with a porn star.  Billy even sees how he is going to die. If the book were related chronologically and if Vonnegut didn't have such a way with language--his sentences lack poetic prose, but have the same quirky, seemingly random rhythm as the plot--then this book wouldn't have been nearly as interesting.  The way it's jumbled up forces the reader to keep putting the pieces together, although Vonnegut has a tendency to over-foreshadow some things like the teapot incident.  And the style makes reading a breeze because it's very relatable for the average vocabulary--no big words to confuse people. The only real flaw is the overuse of the expression \"so it goes\" to mark anytime a person, place, or thing dies.  Wikipedia's article on the book says there are 106 references.  It seemed like many more.  I understand what Vonnegut was going for, but it did get irritating before long. I should warn you, though, that even if the sentences are easy to read, you do need to be the type of reader who can put up with the quirky nature of the book to read it.  So it's not recommended to everyone.  If you're up to putting together a puzzle and like a little sci-fi with your literature, then you'll be fine.  Maybe you won't agree with Vonnegut and the Tralfamadore's view of the universe--maybe you like to believe in free will--but you should still be able to appreciate what a creative feat this book was and what a great author wrote it. That is all.",

Shadow Moon, an ex-con, discovers that the world around him is not what it seems, and embarks on a journey of self-discovery and worth, while traversing the American Midwest with a strange character named Wednesday. But Wednesday is actually Odin, the All-Father, and is gathering up gods of all kinds for a war against the new-gods. simply, i loved it. it's a must-read for anyone who loves Neil Gaiman, anyone who loves a good fairy-tale, anyone who loves any kind of mythology of any kind. you meet a cadre of cultural heroes in this book, transformed into everyday people who can do extraordinary things. pick this book up and be amazed, be transfixed. i know i was.",

         "My partner and I were assigned this book for a local (rural Maritime) bookclub.  He is typically impatient by any measure, so became, as many other of these reviews herein have noted, early irritated and exasperated.  Having finished the work, I can understand his point of view.  I sit calmly through the waiting lines of life, so came away with a different perspective.  If you can't focus easily, and are accustomed to (and prefer) the fast pace of life in current society and expect every writer to mirror that reality, then you will, as others have, complain about the pace of this work.  The author's pace is deliberately slow by design.  The work opens, like a flower.  Once you acclimate to the pace, the work becomes a comfortable place.   I had a French mother, and I was also molested as a child.  The author reflects those realities realistically and accurately.  One of the reasons the work may seem repetitive and tedious may very well be that between each act of molestation, the child's responses are carefully drawn.  The author has done a remarkable job depicting the mindset, psychology and mental language of a child.   The French phrases, far from being annoying, brought smiles of rememberance.  There are indeed some annacronysms in this work, but then, there were so many references she could hardly have had every one correct - KODAK is and was never spelled in mixed case, for example. (Ask anyone from Rochester!) The crow cameos, quotes, and poetry inserts were a nice touch.  In sum, she has written a fine work.  One is well able to empathize with the characters, and through them, see a bit of the author.  Well done.",

         "Wow - little nervous about the flaming I might receive for giving this less than the full 5 stars.  It's a good book, and is a 'compelling work of art,' but we're not talking Crime and Punishment here. The art of the book, I guess, is that Vonnegut created a fun to read (albeit bizarre) fatalistic world that somehow, in the midst of the sci-fi and light humor, portrays the horror of Dresden (but not with the force of a traditional straightforward delivery, in my view).  If read aloud, one senses that a dull monotone is appropriate.  The world of this book is fatalistic, ironic, and ultimately without point.  Like 'Groundhog Day,' reality is on an endless loop, and Billy Pilgrim glides in and out of the planes of time without control or pain.  I have to admit that I didn't really get all of the nonsense about aliens and time travel and all that, but I did see that Pilgrim is portrayed as (I think) the only human in the world who really understood what was going on, and everyone else was a tragic actor in a stupid and violent play.  For me, I could not get over-the-top gaga about the book - there is too much absurdity for that to happen.  And while it is not an endorsement of war, certainly, its message of anti-war is lost a bit in the clutter.  Give Vonnegut some leeway; he was probably stoned out of his mind while he wrote this.  Anyway, KV had a nice conversational style and this is an enjoyable book.  4 Stars.",

         "Neil Gaiman's own introduction describes this book as: \"big and odd and meandering\" and in his postscript as: \"a thriller, and a murder mystery, and a romance, and a road trip.\" Suffice to say that you'll be getting a quite an eclectic mix of genres, tones, characters and themes when you crack open \"American Gods.\" Only days before his release from prison, introverted and taciturn Shadow gets the news that his wife Laura has died in a car accident. Numb with grief, he boards a plane heading for home, only to get a job offer from a man calling himself Mr Wednesday. The deal is simple: Shadow acts as a driver, bodyguard and gofer as Mr Wednesday goes about his mysterious business  what that might be isn't entirely clear, but Shadow is an observant man, and the puzzle pieces are gradually put together... I don't want to say too much more about the plot, as for a long time it's deliberately kept ambiguous as to what exactly Mr Wednesday is doing. Like Shadow, the reader can only pay attention as best she/he can, and appreciate all the sights and sounds that the fantasy road trip offers them. Along with completely original people and places, Gaiman also incorporates real American landmarks such as Rock City and the House on the Rock (though describes them in such a way that makes you question their existence!) To be honest, it took me a while to get into \"American Gods\". It starts off pretty slowly, and for the longest time you have no idea what's going on. There are chapters and passages that seem rather meaningless, and it's not until the book's halfway point that things start to make sense: characters' motivations become clear; disparate plot-lines start getting woven together. But one thing became clear as I made my way through the book  to enjoy the novel to its full extent you just HAVE to have a fairly thorough grasp of ancient mythology and the various pantheons of gods. Half the fun is getting a description of a new character's appearance, personality and traits, and figuring out which of the ancient gods they really are. (An old man with one eye? With an affinity for Wednesday? I know who this is!) Though Gaiman eventually identifies each god explicitly, that still won't mean much if you have no context for them. It's also jam-packed with other references, from Herodotus to The Beatles to obscure Scottish fairy tales collected by Joseph Jacobs. This is a book where Shadow can tell a raven to say: \"nevermore\" without any explanation, so expect a lot of sneaky allusions to go over your head, as I'm sure many of them did with me. As it happens, there are several editions of the novel floating around, and my recommendation is that you read the one published as \"the author's preferred text\". It contains about twelve thousand more words that the original edition, and comes with supplementary material such as reading group questions, an interview with the author, and \"The Monarch of the Glen\", a novella that details another of Shadow's adventures with the ancient gods. It's a deep and complex novel, one that's soon to be adapted for television, which was part of the impetus for me reading it in the first place. In many ways it's vintage Gaiman, specifically in his technique of updating old myths into contemporary settings, reforming them into something fresh but familiar. More than that, it's a story of America's identity, as explored by a (relatively) recent immigrant, and the thousands of contradictory components that make up its whole.",

I like the fact that Oscar Dunn and Henry Adams are mentioned in this story. These were unknown heroes of the RE. It sent me scrambling to do research. Zahra aka the \"Butterfly\" during the Civil War was a spy for the Union soldiers. In a beginning scene, Zahra rescues Archer. I love the way Ms. Jenkins describes scenes in her stories. It makes the reader feel he/she is there. At times, I got disgusted with Archer. He almost allowed Zahra, the love of his life to get away. There are some erotic scenes in this book  since some of the action occurred  in a whorehouse. There are many humorous scenes. One of the funniest is when Zahra is disguised as an old woman and she eats at Archer's hotel. Even Archer is fooled. Sable and Zahra both laugh so much they have tears in their eyes. Then there is the earlier scene when the whores ride into town in a red coach. The character I disliked most was Wilma. Wilma's actions at the end of the story were despicable.",

I don't know exactly what drew me to this book but I think the title was a big part of it.. it just sounds like a really cool book.. This is the first book that I have read by Kurt Vonnegut and since he just passed away recently I thought there was no better time then to read something by him.. and I had Slaughterhouse Five on my shelf.. Slaughterhouse Five well what can I say.. Honestly I didn't really understand alot of this book.. not alot of it clicked.. it seemed like it was scattered all over the place to where it was very hard to follow exactly what was going on.. The whole idea that I picked up in this book is a mind that is unstable in the state of war.. it's hard to think clearly and be straight in a time when war breaks loose.. and maybe that was the intent on why it was written in this type of way.. so you can see what happens to the human mind when war occurs.. \"The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamodorians can look at all the different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.\" \"When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad conidition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments, Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians says about dead people, which is 'So it goes.'\" I'm pretty sure this is the type of book that needs to be reread in order to really sink it in.. and since I have just read it once.. maybe that's a reason why it just didn't do much for me.. And so it goes.. Justin",

         "Sandwiched between two of the \"boomer\" generation's biggest hit movies, \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and \"The Sting,\" the director of those, George Roy Hill, found time to make the film version of \"Slaughterhouse Five.\" It became one of my favorite films over time.  Yet I had never read anything by Vonnegut. With the advent of his death, I figured it was finally time. I enjoyed the book but am happy I saw the movie first. The story revolves around a man who does not live his life in a normal aging sequence but instead, thanks in part to some strange extraterrestrials,  lives by being \"unstuck in time;\" he jumps randomly from time period to time period. So, like the movie \"Pulp Fiction,\" we get a current event and go into the past to undertstand how he got there or we see the past and eventually it ties into the present. I believe the film captures the spirit of the book very well yet there are enough differences between the two for me to be very satisfied with both. The parts that differ from the movie really added to my enjoyment. The novel also alerts you to the fact that some of the action may have been taken directly from Vonnegut's life and the message Vonnegut was trying to get across is maybe a bit clearer than the movie can make it. Funny, I am not sure I would have enjoyed the book without seeing the movie. Why? Well, I am not a big fantasy/sci-fi reader so it is quite possible the subject would have been difficult for me to embrace. I am not sure I would have \"gotten it\" without the film to provide the framework. I could also visualize the characters and their predicaments with the film to fall back on. So my overall point is that this is a book you should enjoy immensely if you have seen the movie.  Of course, I can't tell you otherwise.",

         "Known only as the Butterfly, Zahra fluttered about the country providing information to the Federal forces and aiding in the rescue of runaway slaves and other men and women who required help.  Zahra takes great pride in her small contribution to the civil war efforts, but she's never forgotten one of the men she saved - Archer Le Veq.  The war is over but Zahra has been requested for a special mission - posing as the madam of a brothel in New Orleans. Archer Le Veq owns a prominent hotel in New Orleans.  During the war, he had worked for the Bureau of Military Information, collecting intelligence on the Confederacy.  Until he was captured and came close to losing his life, only to be rescued by a mysterious woman known only as the Butterfly. In the days following the war, the country is in a state of Reconstruction.  For many it's a time of rebuilding and hope.  For others, it's a time of a questionable future as they struggle to be accepted into society.  Zahra was content with her life in South Carolina.  She'd done her part to help her people during the war.  She had no intention of going back into the service of the country, but President Grant requested Zahra and promised to look into the situation involving her parents getting their land back.  Hoping the president would honor his word and help her parents, Zahra takes the assignment.  In order to collect information involving the perilous situations that people of color faced, Zahra will travel to New Orleans posing as the madam of a newly established brothel.  Nobody would suspect the proprietor of such an establishment of gathering information.  To protect her identity, Zahra wears a domino which only seems to entice the men, including Archer's brother, Phillipe.  Everybody wants to know the story behind the mysterious Madam Domino.  Archer fully intends to stay away from the house of ill-repute until circumstances bring them together and he finds himself just as enamored of Madam Domino as everyone else.  Unlike the others though, Archer has a feeling he's met her before, if he could only remember where . . . Beverly Jenkins WINDS OF THE STORM is an awesome tale.  You not only get a fabulous love story but you get further insight into the history behind the figures who struggled to help ensure every man, woman, and child of every race were treated equally.  Zahra is one of the most memorable characters I've ever encountered in a storyline.  She's strong willed, incredibly smart, and selfless.  Archer is everything Zahra needs in a man - virile, sexy, and he accepts her and the roles she plays in an effort to help their people.  There are other equally great characters in this story that do bear mentioning but that would make this review way too long.  I highly recommend this book. You'll want to meet the other great characters from this period in our history. This book is a follow up to Ms. Jenkins book THROUGH THE STORM.  I'm sincerely hoping there will be a third book involving Phillipe.  He's a dynamic character throughout the plot in this story who had me smiling with his antics.  This is a powerfully moving tale that has earned permanent spot on my keeper shelf. Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)",

         "AMERICAN GODS is one of those books that I should have read sooner. It's exactly what I want in an epic, beautifully told story, and proves yet again when Neil Gaiman is a legend among fiction authors. The story is gorgeous, flows incredibly, cleverly weaves classic mythology with the \"new\" gods, tells the adventures and trials of realistic and developed characters, adds in epically tragic side stories, and has so many layers that I'll never be able to list them all. It was exciting, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, surprising, smart, and an absolute joy to read. My imagination went rampant. Every god had his or her own distinct personality, but the ending was what stuck with me the most. It was perfect, and I couldn't have asked for better twists. Shadow is an awesome lead character, and I love how he grew after taking so many things in stride. He made incredible sacrifices and was such a good man that I can't help but love him! Mr. Wednesday is a lot of fun to read, and Laura was also a great heroine who added just enough romance to carry the story, and who had a beautiful ending.

         "I had not read a book by Kurt Vonnegut before and I did not understand what the big deal about his books were. When I first picked up Slaughterhouse Five I expected it to be like so many other standard \"this happened, then this happened, and so on\" books. After the first chapter though, I was hooked. The character of Billy Pilgrim is perfect in that he illustrates the carelessness we have about war. The aliens and their perspective about \"fate\" also gives into this concept that \"war is inevitable\" which Vonnegut is in fact arguing against. I don't want to give away to much, so I'll stop here on the substance. But beyond the \"meaning\" of the book the way it is written is also brilliant. The story goes back and forth and lets us see every moment in its full context. Also, Vonnegut does this clever tactic of bringing up seemingly small and irrelevant material in the course of reading the book only to bring it up again later in the book thus having you turn back the pages and ferociously look for the references. This is at the top-tier of American literature and deserves all the praise it has received over the years.",

         "Slaughterhouse Five is not what I expected it to be... then again, in the first chapter, the author tells the readers exactly what to expect. Or at least an idea but even after being told the first and last sentence or two and the climax I wasn't prepared for what I got. Slaughterhouse Five is one of the most unique books I've ever read. Nothing happens. Let me correct that: people die, Billy Pilgrim (the main character) is abducted by aliens, he is part of the most horrendous bombing that took place in the second world war, and he becomes a common image on the TV. But none of it matters because none of it ever takes any precedence. A climax is impossible, a beginning and end are impossible for that matter. This book does not start or finish it is endless and rambling. Kurt Vonnegut is writing of Billy Pilgrim, a man that has become \"unstuck in time\". This means that he travels to the future and the past, although that statement isn't entirely correct. All moments coexist universally, thus there is no possibility for a future and a past. The problem is describing the book means to enter into the book's world, which is impossible if you don't know what that world is: paradox. The book supplied me with a lot of thought. My mind was always screwing itself up in reading it. The book makes you trip over the guidelines you lay out to understand it. I realize that much more powerfully in describing it now. The peculiarity and tendency to perplex however does not make it a bad book, it's very good on the other hand. Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five brought up interesting issues although what it brought up is not what it's famous for in my opinion. They say it's an anti-war novel but I would say it's more like an anti-human mind novel. Oddly enough it says to us that humanity has no control whatsoever over what happens but it also says that there is nothing else that is in control but just what exists. What exists is there and is unalterable. Everything is laid out carefully, a perfect law that appears to be extreme chaos. I don't necessarily agree with all that Kurt Vonnegut brings up in this famous novel but I do admit that I enjoyed the book for bringing these things up. I felt a new perspective stated clearly and without baggage. I could read this book without applying a philosophical label to it. All in all Slaughterhouse Five is a good discussion novel. It's great for its themes and the conversation that I'm sure will come out of it. The book though well written has very little to it without its ideas though. I would suggest it but only if you leave time for discussion and debate afterwards.",

Gerber has a very important concept that is so often overlooked: to turn yourself from an artisan to a business person, you need to stop working IN your business and start working ON your business. The best way, he says, to think of this is to imagine if you had to \"franchise\" your business. Is the way you're doing things systematic enough that it can be replicated all over the country? In reality, of course, the odds that you WILL franchise your business are negligible, but the same method of thinking will allow you to: ...expand your business to include more employees ...allow you to go on VACATION with a free and easy conscience ....allow someone else to pick up the slack if you fall ill. There are some other good points in here (the value of consistency, etc.) A definite must read for the small business owner. Having said all this, I am not really sure why Gerber \"revisited\" his original E-myth.

         "Superficially, this book is a simple story about an American, Billy Pilgrim, who is captured by German forces and housed in a slaughterhouse in Dresden.  There, he witnesses the horrible firebombing of the city by Allied forces.  Eventually he returns home and marries and takes over the family optometry business. A secondary stream flows underneath this basic story.  Billy Pilgrim is purportedly able to travel through time.  He is also abducted by aliens and kept in their zoo with a young starlet as his \"mate\". Vonnegut's prose is simple, clear, and powerful.  It is all plain English, and he doesn't make any effort to dress up the story with anything pretensions.  Reading his work is refreshing because he never talks down to the reader, he just tells the story.  (In this sense, he is a lot like Nabokov but with a smidgen less zest.) Delve deeper into the meaning of the story, though, and you will find that the story is as deep as you want to go.  Billy Pilgrim is obviously \"shell-shocked\" and suffering internally, though from all outward appearances he seems to be fine.  In his own mind he thinks himself fine, though his frequent flashbacks to his past and his imaginary alien abduction tell otherwise.  So what exactly is going on with Billy? If all this is happening to Billy, what is Vonnegut trying to say?  What are the demons that haunt him, the author?  Vonnegut, too, was at the Dresden firebombing, and in a very real sense this book is his attempt at self-therapy.  How much of Vonnegut is reflected in Billy? The aliens are presented not as time travelers, but as beings that simply \"are\".  They, as well as Billy, see time as a solid mass which can be examined in any order.  Therefore, to them, wars are inevitable, as too are happy times.  The key, they tell Billy, is to look at the happy times rather than dwell on the sad times.  However, the realness of the aliens is certainly in doubt.  Perhaps Billy created the aliens, or picked up the idea from a book, in order to help him cope with his internal pain. The book has a strong anti-war message, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it.  The most repeated phrase is \"So it goes\" which is a way to accept a preordained fate as it comes, but perhaps we don't have to accept that fate is preordained, that we have free-will to choose our fate.  The aliens would scoff at this, but if Vonnegut meant for this to be an anti-war novel, then he must believe that we can control our fate enough to avoid war. The book is a great read.  It is easy enough for young students and meaningful enough for older folks.  5 stars, easily.",

The book is a recipe for putting your self back in control of your working hours - in short, to be able to work on your business, not in it. The distinct Gerber's message is that if your business is to thrive, it will engage you in a process of constant personal development. For it to change, you have to change too. In order to do this, you must have written goals. As Watson put it:\" Everyday at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business\". Finally, the success of this book coincides with the boom in business franchising, in what Gerber called \"turnkey revolution\". Franchising has a system (eg Mc Donald) which epitomises speed, orderliness and simplicity.

They were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on.\" Thank you for listening, and enjoy the book.  One other thing: Chapter 1 may put you off and seem boring.

         "Slaughterhouse 5, or Slaughterhouse five, or The Children's Crusade, also called A Duty-Dance with Death, is described by the author Kurt Vonnegut's alter-ego, Billy Pilgrim as a `fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \"The Florence of the Elbe,\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tell. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. Peace.' So it goes. The book is an anti-war book, but tells us that it is about as useful being an anti-war book, as being an anti-typhoon book, meaning that some things will never change. Vonnegut tells us this by giving us the story of Billy Pilgrim, whose most important role in life was to witness the secret American British bombing of Dresden, where 135,000 died, and who spent most of his time as an American Prisoner of War, a survivor who can tell the youth of today what war is all about, by using his shellshock trauma induced time travel capabilities, given to him by the Tralfamadore aliens, to revisit the war, so that he can write a book about it, goes to see old war buddies, becoming unstuck in time, his life as a series of scenes in a non-linear fashion which ends up making linear sense, even though it did not at the time. So it goes. Slaughterhouse 5 is a very interesting and somewhat touching series of events that finally all come home to roost in the final pages, the loss of man is the gain of man, whether we like it or not, is not the point, Darwin told us that this is what we are designed to do, Billy Pilgrim becomes an optometrist in the process, marries a woman who suddenly has a series problem, while Bill ends up in a zoo on an alien planet to produce children with Montana Wildhack, a famous movie actress, while trying to write his Dresdon story, filled with death, a plane accident where he was the only survivor following his POW term, fact from fiction, he thinks the rescue party are nazis, it sets off the time travel again. So it goes. Vonnegut is not all down and war depressing however. His humour captured brilliantly by such antics as considering the money tree that grew hundred dollar bills, gems and bank bonds, feeding off the people who met the quicksand by its base, or a young Jesus who once built a cross with his father so the Romans could use it to do something to a protestor that they didn't like. When the wit is there it scores in aces. You have never read the likes of such clowning around before, although compared to Joseph Heller's Catch 22, this one is more personal, less satirical, more direct and exposes that horrible World War II bombing of Dresden. In 1941 Charles Portal, A British Air Staff officer, put forward the idea that entire cities and towns should be bombed. Air Marshall Arthur Harris agreed in February 1942. It was napalmed in 1945. Vonnegut made it very public in this 1969 novel. It was revealed by the historian David Irving in 1963 in his publication, \"The Destruction of Dresdon\". So it goes. Billy spends the final days of his life out across New York looking to tell a radio show his story, ends up finding a world war II sci-fi book author's book as window dressing, attempts to buy the book as a memory keepsake because he met the author and knew the war buddy who introduced him to the books, and is nearly arrested, and or committed, old age coupled with the dying man's last bastion of whatever his mind can make of it all, gives us much to ponder in death, by remembering our lives, Pilgrim travels in his memory and says that death is living ones memories over and over again... so best be good... and enjoy life. So it goes.",

A comment which is true, this is not a big book, just over 150 pages, but even with that Dresden remains a presence. Something inevitable and dark, which can't be shifted, and reflects throughout the real tragedy that is Billy Pilgrim's life.

         "After the first read of Michael Gerber's \"The E-Myth Revisited\" I could hardly put it down.  I will say right from the start that YES ITS SIMPLIFIED, NO ITS NOT THAT EASY, but thats exactly what makes this a great book.  I read the critics' reviews and they seem to be basing their entire opinion of this man's teachings off of one book.  If it were physically possible to fit enough information in one paperback book  to run a business, then running a business would not be difficult at all. But no, this is not a how-to manual or a solve-all method, this is the beginning of a process.  Gerber introduces us to the three personalities of a entrepreneur (technician, manager, and entrepreneur or visionary) and discusses how most small businesses face a similar problem and that is letting the technician take over the business and killing off the other two. He discusses how the greatest one-time small businesses in the world have overcome that obstacle.  He does this mainly through praising the franchise system.  In this way I consider this book also on economics- explaining a little bit how small businesses' affect world economy. The franchise system allows all personalities to excel, and when they excel the customer is better served and better satisfied.  The system works.  So managers and technicians can have a business that will be successful and they will be fulfilled working on.  But it does not stop there.  He also teaches that entrepreneurs must create their small businesses according to a \"franchise prototype,\" basically set-up systems and operations so the business can work most effectively (like as if they were to sell it, even if they don't plan to). When you set-up you business as something you could sell if you wanted to, then you are creating a business of value.  When you do that, then you can be most successful and fulfilled.  What is the point in going into business if after 5 years you've only created more work for yourself and nothing to show for it? In the book's simple story-telling format, Gerber travels with his protege (and the reader) and walks her through the mindset.  In order to go from unsuccessful to wildly successful- your mindset has to be the first thing to change.  (Read the \"one star\" reviews to see the effects of a closed mind). This book reminds me of the simplicity of \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\" and its philosophical take on business.  No, its not a well-laid out instruction manual, thats your job to create a manual.  This book will inspire you to do more than you have previously thought possible.",

         "THE E_MYTH REVISITED is worth reading and revisiting. Gerber reminds the reader about the basic premise of business: satisfying the customer, in a new, entertaining, and insightful way. He proposes that the three key characteristics (skills) of a successful business owner are: skilled technician, entrepeneur, and manager. This is sound advise and a proper balance of the three prevents tyranny by any one personality. I have seen exagerations of all three of these skill sets to the ruin of the afflicted enterprises; mine included. As a case study, he follows Sarah, owner of All About Pies, as he leads her through her catharsis from exhausted technician to balanced, productive and fulfilled business owner. There is a great deal of truth that Gerber captures and teaches along with room for some disagreement. Not every business, for example, is suited to be franchised. Not every service can easily be documented. Nonetheless, this quick read is worth its weight in gold to the young or new businessman. I wish I had read this 20 years ago - it would probably have changed my business and my life.",

         "More than a simple satire Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is one of the most important books written in the North America in the 20 Century. Dealing with both personal experiences, fiction and introducing himself as a character, the writer has created a unique work that will remain in the literary cannon forever. It is hard to tell what this novel is about, because it is sometimes funny, sometimes a sci-fiction, and sometimes very very sad. By using such device, Vonnegut shows the reader the absurdity of the war and of the 20 century as well. Death and life are side by side in his words. At the same time, the novel is a personal journey towards the center of himself. Using a fragmented prose only enhances the experience of reading this novel. With such technique, the book requires more attention from the reader, and increases the curiosity of what will happen next, and when this part of the narrative will be resumed. This is one reason why many readers find Vonnegut's work stranger than the average writer. So he is, but in a good way. This elliptic narrative is very sophisticated and beautiful to those who read a book and care about language, character development and plot. Vonnegut's sense of humor and sarcasm are brilliant turning what could be a tacky story into a deep work, filled with undertones and, psychological and political ideas. The constant use of the sentence `So it goes' display a high level of sophistication, that many veteran writers will never acquire. All in all, `Slaughterhouse-Five' is an important read for everyone who is interested in good and profound books. Those works that make us care more about the world we live, the society we are building everyday and, above all, the life we are leading.",

However, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is certainly the best of what I've read of him, and unlike some of his other books (\"Breakfast of Champions,\" for instance) holds up well to multiple readings. \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" is typical Vonnegut in many ways, but it works better than the majority of his novels due to an emotional element that is usually lacking.  I felt for Billy Pigrim as a person and really cared whether or not he was able to pick up the pieces of his life and recover from the hell-on-earth atmosphere of World War II.  One scene stands out clearly in my mind---Billy at the window of a factory that manufactures (maple syrup I think?  Anyway, something sweet) and crying as he licks a spoon---crying because of the utter simplicity and unqualified pleasure something like maple syrup can give him.  It's as if the intensity of the horror he experiences during the fire-storming of Dresden increases the intensity of all other experiences as well, so that for this one moment, his whole world has come down to the taste of maple syrup on a spoon.  Wow, what a great scene. This novel inevitably gets compared to \"Catch-22\" because of its subject matter and quirky tone, but really the two books aren't very similar.  I like \"Catch-22\" better, but would still recommend \"Slaughterhouse-Five.\"",

American Gods is an oof book. I had no choice but to keep reading, and when I was done, I was done. I had to take a breather before moving on to something else. (Okay, a twenty-minute breather.) But the exhaustion American Gods left in its wake is the best kind. Its the exhaustion of a book that made you think and swept you off your feet with its writing, characters, and story. Not a bad problem to have. You wouldnt think a big, muscly convict would have a name like Shadow. But when Shadow was a kid, he was shy and bookish, and hes still got a little of that left in him. Once he gets out of prison, all he wants to do is see his wife, take a bath, get a good job, and forget the whole thing ever happened. But a few days before Shadow is released, his wife and future employer are both killed in a car crash, and a strange man with a glass eye shows up, offering Shadow a job to work for him. Shadow doesnt know what exactly hell be doing, but hes desperate. So he says yes. Little does he know that hes working for an honest-to-goodness god  or that every god that has ever been brought through immigrants to America is living somewhere in the country. Their existence has been rough at best, but a new schism threatens all of them. And Shadow, who only wanted a hot bath, is trapped in the middle of it. American Gods is challenging in a number of ways. Its over five hundred pages long. Its plot is often vague and jumps around at what seem like inconvenient times. Its an American epic by a Brit. And, of course, the idea that all these gods are real at the same time takes some getting used to, even if you grew up with Rick Riordan. But all those elements that make the book challenging actually strengthen it. All the gods being real means that no particular religion is knocked; I, as a Christian, did some deep thinking about my faith as a result of reading American Gods, but I didn't feel like Neil Gaiman was dissing it. I personally did not notice Gaimans Britness at all. And the length and the plot are never too much. There are occasional snapshots of early American life and the gods/creatures people of those eras followed, and though I understand why people would be annoyed by them, I was fascinated. The several chapters Shadow spends in a small Michigan town are fabulous; you expect to be bored when theres no supernatural stuff going on, and you're not in the least. Theres a reason so many American authors set their stories in the middle of nowhere, after all. This is in many ways an outrageous book, and its not for the faint of heart or the very young. But I enjoyed and was challenged by it, and I hope you feel the same way.",

         "This is the tenth Joe Gray, the talking cat , murder mystery.  I loved the first one in this series, and definitely want to read more. But I broke a cardinal rule for myself with this book choice.  This is the tenth book in this series, but the second one that I read.  So unfortunately for me, I felt that a lot of character's introductions and action had happened in the previous books that was referred to in this book, but I was not completely in the loop for this story.  Probably for that reason alone, I gave this book 3 stars.  Could I have enjoyed it more if I had read them in order?  Well, since I liked the first book so much, I'm going to give this book the benefit of the doubt. The mystery involves the murder of an elderly beloved movie star, and the additional finding of buried children's bones.  Once again the antics of the feline \"talkers\" found clues that they relayed to the police by phone as 'unknown snitches' which lead to finding clues to these intertwined murders.  There was also a precocious 12 year old girl that added much heart, intrigue, and thrills to this particular Joe Gray mystery. I will definitely read more Joe Gray mysteries, starting with the second one---CAT UNDER FIRE. These are definitely unusual, but compelling 'cats' tales!!",

My problem with this book is that those ideas could be presented in about 4 or 5 chapters, maximum. A fair portion of the 18 chapters of this book is pure fluff. Especially toward the end, where some of the chapters were complete zeroes. I suppose the author had to pad it out for the publisher to make it look like a serious business book. Furthermore, this author has what I'd call a high word-to-data ratio. I've read few books where so many words are used to say so little.

I would give Listen a rating of 4.5 stars. In this book 12-year-old Charley is recovering from an accident that shattered her leg, but that is not as hard as facing the loneliness of a summer without friends and a father who does nothing but work. During the summer Charley finds a mysterious dog across the lake. Charley must bond with the dog in the woods that her mother loved. Three things that I enjoyed about this book were that it had a dog in it, it showed love and compassion for animals, and it's in the perspective of Charley.  The writing style in this story is in the 3rd person. Stephanie S. Tolan always said Charley not I. For example: \"Charley is running along a twilight road between towering trees, chasing a figure that she can barely make out ahead of her.\" I would recommend this book to anyone who likes dogs or animals because Coyote is a dog and an animal and he is the main part of the book Listen. I don't think there is anything that should be changed in this book because it is great the way it is.  Review by Briana U.",

         "The description of Slaughtehouse Five as either an anti-war or science-fiction novel isn't necessarily a negative, or even incorrect label, but, let's say instead, a restrictive one. It would be similar to calling \"Beowolf\" a poem or \"Dr. Strangelove\" a black comedy. It is a truthful assesment, it just doesn't do the work justice. Slaughterhouse is a brilliant satire/black comedy of not just war and science-fiction, but humanity, love, death, friendship, and any other ideals that we as a race hold dear. It is this that causes the biggest problem with Vonnegut's appreciation by mass audiences, \"How can he make fun of that?\" Simple, he just brings in a space-craft. My favorite character of not only Slaughterhouse, but all of Vonnegut's collective work is by far and away Kilgore Trout. The essential paperback writer, and perhaps an insight to what might have been with Vonnegut (consider what would have happened to him had his work been released at a less tolerable time-period during the history of American Literature and you will see what I mean) Trout is a pat on the back for any independent artist, regardless of the genre, that the effect your work has on a small group is not lessened by the size of your audience, but, instead, confirmed by the reaction of the few. He is also hilarious and brilliant. Other then Trout, however, the story revolves around the life of Billy Pilgram. Not the life as you or I, or a lesser writer even would see it, but as according to the view of Tralfamadorians, an alien race who has a greater understanding of the view-point of time then humans ever will. So it is through their eyes that we witness the fascinating life of Pilgrim. From his days in captivity by the German army during World War II leading up to the fire-bombing of Dresden, to his abduction by aliens and use as a museum piece as he \"mates\" with porn-star Montana Wildhack, through marriage, plane crashes, insanity, and death we not only watch his fascinating life, but find ourselves laughing at our own ridiculous society. If you enjoy satire, black comedy, and poking fun of all that you hold dear, then Slaughterhouse is defenitely for you. If not... then read it anyway.",

Billy Pilgrim is described as a bee in amber who can do nothing but exist in a world he cannot control (This metaphor can of course be extended the entire human race.)  Vonnegut uses the aliens and Billy Pilgrim's time travel to show the futility of trying to stop war.  The aliens while they know all about war and even the destruction of the universe do nothing to stop it because it is just the way of things. So it goes. This phrase used throughout the book seems to say what difference does it really make we are all going to die anyway.  Also especially interesting is the time travel for instance at one point Billy Pilgrim sees a bombing in reverse order.  He sees the planes take back the bombs and stop the fires, he sees the bombs being disassembled, and finally he sees the raw materials hidden into the mountain where they can't hurt anyone anymore. So it goes. The irony that permeates Billy's experiences is not only dogmatic but also well developed in this classic work of fiction.",

Me.  The author of this book.\") to his life as an optometrist in Ilium, NY (that is, Schenectady) in the 1960's. But why should I say anything?  This is a unique novel, a great, moving read, & a quick one too--you can read it in one sitting if you want to (I think I did it in 2 or 3 over one weekend).  You have little to lose and everyting to gain.",

But like Slapstick, his look at the future did not enthrall me.  Also I am not an environmentalist so the overall theme of the book \"Humans will destroy the Earth if we don't do something\" didn't touch me.  The only character in the book who is compelling is the headless son of Kilgore Trout.  His roll is the events is so passive that you can't \"root\" for him. And there was no one else in the book to grab my attention.  All in all it was written well and read quick, like all his previous books, but there was nothing in it that jumped out and begged for attention.  Thanx for your time: T",

         "OVERVIEW: Fun book that hits every need that a parent is looking for in a Children's book: great words, smart writing and incredible illustrations. THE BOTTOM LINE: Parents are constantly on the lookout for a new children's book for their kids' shelf that takes language, art and some sort of lesson and incorporates all those elements in a nice package: this one fits the order. MY REVIEW: THE GOOD: Every now and then parents come across a children's book that leaves the entire family in a euphoric state. Since it happened to most current parents when they were younger and their parents opened up and read \" Green Eggs And Ham\", now they're on the prowl for more books to fit their kids' bookshelves. Unfortunately we come across a lot of dusty dud-tomes in our book hunt but every now and then we get a gem that has our three year old staring, our six year old smiling and the parents enjoying the read. This book does all that. The author uses cookies (and so many things related to cookies) to teach words and simultaneously share some (very funny) life lessons such as: \"Trustworthy means, if you ask me to hold your cookie until you come back, when you come back, I will still be holding your cookie.\" This would be great in itself, but Jane Dyer goes above and beyond with her lifelike illustrations with almost a nod to Norman Rockwell with their detailed beauty by showing on that \"Trustworthy\" page the little girl, holding and staring at a cookie and biting the side of her lip. You can't beat that. Definitely a great read that'll leave parents wanting more pages and kids wanting a reread with cookies, please. THE BAD: I wish there were more pages? There was nothing bad. Well, except maybe the desire for some kids to want cookies. THE UGLY: Nothing ugly about this book. Printed on nice paper, the cover is a nice stock and the illustration is repeated on the hardcover. Even the inside flaps are an enjoyable read highlighting words like \"SHAMELESS\" when it comes to the author (you can check out Amy Krouse Rosenthal's site here) plugging her own work and \"ILLUSTRIOUS\" as defined with the illustrator's name (Jane Dyer).",

I think the reviewer who lauded the book and described it as not one story, but many, was probably the most helpful to me to understand what it is that I missed. I enjoyed reading the book, but it was easy for me to put down. There were segments, like the time spent in the more or less real world while Shadow was in Wisconsin, that I enjoyed, but the scenes with the gods in their various forms left me confused. I will chalk that up to my ignorance of the gods and mythology and my lack of interest in the fantasy world that Gaiman created. My comments reflect my personal tastes and limitations. Even though I didn't love the book, I was in awe of Gaimans ability to create such a detailed imaginary world. It is imaginary, right?",

When Jake takes less than two weeks to be kicked out of a small town school the Eccentric Applewhite family take him into the homeschool they've set up for their talented children. Jake learns self reliance, self esteem, and how to take responsibility and care for others in his time with the Applewhites. Most of all he discovers himself in an extremely surprising and very non-cheesy way. The book is a fantastic read that every middle school-high school student should read.

         "As a mother who screens everything her 12-year-old daughter reads, I get lazy sometimes and rely on trusted sources to provide titles of new books that we would like added to our home library. In the case of \"Surviving the Applewhites\", it was a recommendation featured in Discovery Girls magazine, and definitely deserving of the spot. The story is heart-warming, and, because our daughter grew up on musicals, and, in particular, \"The Sound of Music\", the adventures of the Applewhites resonated strongly with her.  I can see quite easily how life with the Applewhites can be made into a TV series like \"The Waltons\" - in fact, it's rather a shame it hasn't been done! In the words of said daughter: \"The book, `Surviving the Applewhites' by Stephanie S. Tolan is a funny, good-for-the-soul sort of book. \"Jake Semple is known as a bad boy. He set fire to his old school and got kicked out of every school in Rhode Island.  And he has spiky red hair, an eyebrow pierce and as many earrings as you can count. Now, only the Creative Academy in North Carolina at the home of the Applewhites will take him on as a student. Then Randolph Applewhite decides to cast Jake in his production of `The Sound of Music' as Rolf. Can Jake dance, act and sing as perfectly as everyone says he will? And can Jake and E.D., the only Applewhite who isn't artistic, survive each other? \"My favorite part was when Jake meets everyone in the Applewhite family. There's E.D., a smart, sensible girl; Cordelia, E.D.'s sister, a beautiful dancer; Ms. Lucille, aunt, an optimistic poet; Mr. Randolph, father,  a stubborn director; Ms. Sybil, mother, famous author; Destiny, E.D's four-year-old brother; Hal, E.D. big brother, recluse; Mr. Archie, Lucille's husband, carpenter; and Mr. Zebediah, grandfather, leader and carpenter. \"I would give this book five stars: two stars for the original and funny plot, two stars for the funny characters that made me wish I lived next-door to them, and one star for the humor shown throughout and in the plot. \"I would recommend this book to anyone who is home-schooled. I would also recommend it to people who go to actual schools. And, finally, I would recommend it to boys and girls alike. I am sure both would love it.\"",

         4,
         "As a huge fan of Neil Gaiman, I have to admit that I am addicted to his story-telling. I read and LOVED Fragile Things (Collection of the short stories where my favorite was a story with this book's character Shadow), Star Dust (probably my #1 favorite), The Ocean at the End of the Lane (mysterious and compelling, you just had to know what next!) and Neverwhere (only 10% into the book, not yet hooked!). And as for American Gods, which I listened to on audio, I loved the protagonist, Shadow. I could relate to his cluelessness as I - the reader - spent much of the book being only slightly more than clueless but all in all, I am very glad to have read American Gods. What I found most difficult was not the fantasy, I love fantasy and can imagine anything, but accepting gods and dead people in human form. As a reader, when I couldn't imagine my characters - especially these \"gods\" - I couldn't get on board with the assumptions of the author, and thus I didn't bond as deeply with the characters and I kept reading mainly because I was curious and wanted to see where it would all lead Shadow. I find it strange that I felt this way about American Gods. I was on board with far more super natural and fantastical plots and characters in the other works by Gaiman but I just couldn't shake the doubt and ridicule my mind would conjure up around gods being in human form. And that blocked my true enjoyment of this work, which is still a genius piece by a genius writer, one that I simply could not fully appreciate. This is the kind of book you can appreciate greatly if you know a whole lot about the gods and deities of all cultures, past and present. The symbolism is all over the place. You'll see African gods, Russian gods, old tribal gods, ancient gods, Norwegian gods, and so much more but most of these gods are not American (hence my playful headline above.) You'll read about the sacrifices, the rituals, the tortures, the believers and the doubters, the old and the new gods. It all builds up to one premise: That America is not a place where gods survive or do particularly well. Gods don't belong here in this land and because the immigrants over thousands (yes, Gaiman believes settlers have been coming to America for many thousands of years!) brought their gods over in their minds, then those gods took form and shape and therefore existed because people believed in them. The new gods, Gaiman tells us, are the gods of cars, technology and a fast paced life (Hmmmm. Okay!!) and even those change quickly, proving yet again that Americans do not have loyalty to one or any type of god. I really should put \"god\" in quotations. Highly imaginative, with the usual excellent story telling and style, I only wish I could get appreciate the story more to give it a full 5-stars. That is my heart-felt review of the American Gods. This won't be the last book I read by Gaiman. Here's to the next journey with this talented writer.",

         "SPOILERS BELOW!! Finally got around to reading this novel I bought several years ago.  Tried then but couldn't get into it.  I had better luck this time.  I don't understand the effusive praise for this book.  There is no doubt that Gaiman is a talented author and has a certain flavor and flourish with language, but I was  over four-hundred pages into this before anything really happened. This book is almost all set-up, all prologue.  There's a war coming between the gods, old and new, we are told repeatedly.  While we wait for this war, we follow the protagonist Shadow around, as he eats, sleeps, does odd jobs, hangs out in a small town, meets iconic and well-known )but hardly fleshed out in this story) characters, gets visited by his dead wife, and dreams.  Not a lot else goes on for hundreds and hundreds of pages. When Gaiman finally decides to wrap it up, we discover the truth about some characters and see that the war we were promised is basically averted.  There is no great battle between the gods, and if there is even any minor clash between them it is largely downplayed. I get it.  The book isn't about that.  Despite the title and the endless prattling about the great war among the gods for once and for all, we don't get one.  Whatever.  The book was written well enough to be mildly enjoyable even if the story basically meandered for its entire length.  I just really expected more, given the reviews, ratings and praise heaped upon this somewhat interesting but essentially pointless novel.",

I could probably forgive this, if it was in favor of world building, but the author makes next to no attempt to actually flesh out the world she's plopped her protagonist into. For example, the magicians project their thoughts to each other to have conversations while in separate places, but we aren't given any type of introduction to it, so the limits seem nonsensical (although now I've written that, I wonder if they perhaps are nonsensical and that's why they aren't explained). It's almost like the author wanted to write a book about class uprising and the rest just didn't matter at all to her. The only reason I gave it 2 stars, instead of the 1 because there isn't really anything I liked about the book so far, is because it's possible that it got better in the chapters I didn't read.",

Angered by the annual purging of the slums where she lives, she throws a rock at the magician's magical shield and manages to break it. This sets the magicians on Sonea's trail as they wish to locate the untrained mage before she destroys the city. Magician's Guild is a fairly decent fantasy read. Sonea is realistically characterised as a mistrusting slum dweller and we get a look at the magician's who are trying to find her. We spend a good deal of the book, watching Sonea hide from the mage's and more time watching the mage's talk about her. That may sound like a criticism, but it's not really. We get to spend time with these characters, we understand their motivations and dreams. The world building is very good; not quite on the level of Robin Hobb, but at least I don't feel the persistent need to strangle the main character, even if she is slightly annoying and a little passive at times.  I do want to find out more about her and her future. Not particularly sold on the budding romance, but there's two more books to go. Will certainly be reading the rest of the series.",

         "Randy Morgenson was but one of a long list of great wilderness managers that have called Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks home. I worked in two different locations in the Sierra with wilderness management being a major responsbility at one. I took part in the annual Central-South Sierra Wilderness managers working group and made a lot of friends as a result. The group was incredibly knowledgeable, professional and experienced managing the second largest area of designated wilderness in the lower 48 states, an area that is harder to manage than any other large wilderness area in the U.S.  I know, or know of, many of the people the author writes about in this book.  He hits the nail on the head on all of these. I did not know Randy personally, but knew many people like him, at least in most ways.  His lack of faithfulness to his wife and seeming unwillingness to balance his love of the wilderness with a good marriage did not endear him to me. His dedication and idealism were such that I'm sure we could have had long conversations next to a fire long into the night, comparing notes and sharing the same frustrations. I remember very well the fliers with Randy's picture on it and found it highly unusual to hear of an instance where a fellow employee was missing. In my career, which I am now retired from, I only heard of two employees ever being lost and both of these were in a very remote area of New Mexico where a new employee and a volunteer from the east got turned around. People who seek jobs in the outdoors, even those who are bright, shiny and new, have the skills to take care of themselves enough to show up at the end of the day or the end of a ten day tour. Of that group, those who want to work in wilderness or backcountry areas show up with even more outdoor savvy.  To have a BOLO (be on the lookout) flier arrive in your mailbox was something routine, but one with a park ranger's face and description was shocking.  I just didn't think it possible.  Several years later I was involved in putting a perimeter around Yosemite NP when a female ranger escaped a would be kidnapper and that, while unusual, happened a few times during my career. Given that background, I disagree with some reviewers who indicate, rather cynically, that Morgenson's disappearance did not warrant a book be written about it. They don't realize how rare this event was, and continues to be. I think Eric Blehm does a fabulous job of portraying employees of land management agencies in a realistic manner, most especially revealing the downside of being an employee for one of the four major land management agencies of the federal government.  The vast majority of them do so because they are dedicated and committed to the lands so many citizens take for granted. For most, choosing a career in the field is part of a life plan, not something that they fell into by circumstance. The public, by and large, doesn't understand the difficulties and sacrifices that natural resource agency employees make in pursuing their careers, especially if one decides to stay in the field for most or all of it, while staying dedicated.  I don't recall how many hundreds of times I was told I had the greatest job in the world or people who would say \"and I suppose you call this work.\"  Most often I would say \"you don't know the tenth of it!\"  On the other side of the coin Mr. Blehm was able to bring in some of the good aspects to the job, especially pointing out the sense of humor and how insightful people gain do it. I hope the fact that these employees are well above average intelligence is understood after the reader finishes the book. At times, during my career, I felt out of my league in the face of this. I compliment the author for being able to insert himself in a situation, and I hope I'm not exaggerating, that was highly emotionally charged. It would have been so easy to step on many toes and have a large number of people give him stone silence. While reading the book I became very aware of this and realized that he seemed to have spoken with nearly everyone who knew Randy. Given Morgenson's complexity I would think that this was not an easy line to walk. I highly recommend this book to a large group of people, not just those who love and travel in wilderness areas, but for others who haven't had much, or any, outdoor experience.  There is much to be gained by reading it. But there is one lingering question.  Where IS the meeting of the Gay Rangers for Christ being held?!!",

         "Would Randy Morgenson have approved of Eric Blehm's chronicle of his life and the portrait conveyed of him? Those who knew him personally and wrote reviews on this site can answer that much better than I, but somehow my intuition tells me he would. Blehm does a commendable job of piecing together the life of a complex man who lived according to his own ideals, the love/respect for nature being among the highest. Like anyone, Randy's life was not without its blemishes and complications, but in many ways he was a self-made man, educated by one of the grandest and most reliable and trustworthy of teachers--nature herself. Unfortunately, such a teacher is greatly undervalued, if it is even given any passing respect or credibility today. Randy knew this and he knew nature's teachings in an intimate way that others might only dream of. It is sad and ironic that a man who harbored his own writing ambitions didn't live to tell his story, but I see Randy as one of those living artists whose canvass is reality itself. He carved out a deeply human story while living season after season in the grand Sierra mountain range. His life (while far, far from perfect) was a kind of high art whenever he put on his ranger uniform and followed his calling. I liked one simple antecdote Blehm gave that captures much of Randy's philosophy that often put him at odds with greater society. He would let the front lawn of his home grow and grow, leave it to its natural state, while the neighbors would be up in arms about this \"transgression.\" The lawn didn't get cut until Randy's wife finally did it. There are a great many things to explore and discover in this book!",

In brief the story follows 3 woman- 1 Franny, a doctor who's recently lost a pediatric patient to cancer, 1 - Karen a inmate on death row and the last Celia whose husband was murdered. So it comes to pass that Frannys Uncle, who raised her after her parents died, dies-so Franny ditches her fianc, heads to her old hometown, and has some type of revelation- she ditches her well paid job ( all with the fianc) and takes up her Uncles old job at the prison ( he too was a MD) where she ends up taking care of Karen. And we're told early on that Karen killed Celia's spouse. The story's supposed to revolve around loss and grief and forgiveness - but good god what a boring read! There's too much time spent detailing the crimes of the other women on death row - you think they will have a bigger part to play in this novel, but they don't. Granny comes across as a self-centered selfish bitch-she dumps her fianc for no clear reason, is meaner than a cat in a sack to him when he comes to her hometown to try and help her deal with losing her Uncle-then she seems to just drink a lot and feel sorry for Karen. Celia has sex with a young fella and buys a bikini ( I know, what the hell does this have to do with the story) but she does work toward forgiving Karen, but that \" journey\" barely merits one page in the whole book. Sorry fellow readers-sloppy put together, I ended up thinking all 3 women should get killed off - I only kept reading out of frustration, I thought there would be a terrific twist ( as there was in \" how to be lost\" and boy was it a stunner!) but no such joy.

The book did not take long in terms of growing on me though it does feel like it is targeted at teens. The story moves at a blistering pace and is based on the life of Sonea, a girl with magical powers who does not know that she has them. She realizes that she can perform magic at a very inappropriate moment and heads back to the slums where her closest allies dwell. The story picks up from there as the magicians of the Guild start hunting for this talented stranger. The plot: It is exciting, fast paced but extremely simple. There is very little politics and the number of characters leaves nothing to the reader's imagination. You know who the bad guy is from the very start. Even then, it does not stop you from reading on. The characters: I would have to say that the characters are probably the best part of this book. Rothen really leaves an impression on the reader and comes across as a kind person. Similarly some of the support characters are also woven very well. The writing style: I am uncertain what to say about the writing style. It is good enough and I read the book fairly quickly. It is, like the plot, very simple but not necessarily the kind that makes you sit at the edge of your sofa forgetting about the coffee. The language is very simple and you do get the feeling that unlike other fantasies, this is specifically targeted to the teenage community. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I will be starting the second book today (which is when I finished this). I would recommend this as a nice book to anyone who likes fantasy. It does not have the rich details that Robin Hobb, Tolkien or GRR Martin can generate but it is definitely something very readable.",

The book covers Randy's life growing up in Yosemite, and his intense love of the Sierras.

As someone with curly, unruly hair (though not to the extent of Gaimans), it was easy to see what his inspiration probably was. Its fun to imagine what might be living up there. -Tanya Read (Read.

Loved the banter between Marcus and Honoria and the secondary characters added to storyline, making you feel like you are right there in the middle of all the ruckus!  Ms. Hawkins writes exactly the type of story that I want in my HRs, namely, great alpha hero, smart and witty heroine, great story line and of course, the lovely way it all comes together for their HEA!

Why the heck would he fall in love with her? The woman who is asking 70000 times  what the ring is worth just because she knows its sentimental value to him and he can \"afford it\"? He is suppose to think woman are money hungry and manipulative and Honoria is suppose to show him their not? Honoria is worse than Marcus yet Karen wants to make her more lovable than him. She trys to portrays Marcus purchase of a nobalemans land as dastardardlly and cold harted when the man keeps drincking and gaming his fortune away yet Honoria is suppose to be a poor girl down on her luck. She does this a lot in her books. The woman say one thing is bad about the men and they are just as bad if not worse. I love her secondary characters and if you overlook Honoria actions at times then the story line is good you just wish they got together in a better way.

Unfortunately, this just felt like a typical cutesy kids book that anyone could have written. The story follows Chu, a little panda with a destructive sneeze, through his day as his parents take him to the library, a restaurant, and the circus. The illustrations are really the only thing that provides any substance to the story  they were creative and I think a kid would enjoy them. But the overall story was just okay and I wouldnt expect it to be a favorite unless you bring more to the table as a reader. -Tanya Read (Read. Run. Study.)",

If everything is extraordinary then doesn't that just mean its ordinary?  But I get it.  This isn't as severe a criticism as it may seem, and I'm not guiltless.  People communicating in a relaxed fashion don't really need to be rigorous.  But this tendency may rob you when you really want to deliver a message. So when I say this book is unique, I need the full meaning and impact of that word to come across to you reader.  I cannot say that I've ever quite read a book that I can adequately compare it to.  It's mythology, history, crime fiction, fantasy, satire and humanism kinda all rolled into one.  Gaiman really is good at creating atmosphere.  It is a gentle but inexorable sense of intrigue.  And the characters are illuminated in varying sharp and then subtle brushstrokes.  This book is like a tour of some fascinating museum. Leave your expectations at the door, and keep an open mind.",

I did not hate any of the stories, but I did love some more than others. The creativity and genius behind the writing of these stories is what really secured this book right at the top for me. The first story \"The Case of Four and Twenty Blackbirds\" was my favorite by far! As a detective tries to solve the murder of Humpty Dumpty, the story goes on to involve many more nursery rhymes characters, and I found myself chuckling and shaking my head at the absurdity of it all. But I loved it, absolutely loved it. October in the Chair was another favourite of mine. How Gaiman was able to capture the essence of each month and brought them to life...I mean, wow. And then there was Don't Ask Jack, which was a story revolving around a jack-in-the-box, which gives you chills. Finally, there was The Witch's Headstone, which was a glimpse at Neil Gaiman's other book The Graveyard Book, which I had already read. But it was still nice to go reread an excerpt of it almost and know that at the end of it, there is much more to the story. A great collection, and worth the read.",

The basic premise is that no matter how people immigrated to America, no matter when, they all brought with them the legends and myths from home. Now a battle is coming between the old gods of legend and the new ones, the ones created by millions of people worshiping television and technology. Neil tells stories like I wish I could. The previous book of his that I read a few months back was Stardust. As with most books, it was way better than the movie, and I love the movie. His books are tough acts to follow.

         "Everyone says, Youve got to read Gaiman! Well, I did and I must admit that this is one of the most brilliantly boring books that I have ever read. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, Gaiman took me on a meandering road trip to places I never wanted to see. Dont get me wrong, its not all bad. Gaiman has created some interesting, well developed characters. The story is filled with moments of brilliance, with excellent dialogue and incredible humor. He has done an excellent job of getting into the American psyche, the old traditions that people brought from the old country and how it all has been watered down and lost through the great American melting pot. These gods are being slowly replaced by the new gods that we worship, the story is even more relevant now than it was when it was written. My biggest problem with the book was that I just didn't care. For all of its brilliance, there was no connection created. Its hard to be passionate about a passionless character. Shadow was a pawn, a tool used for everyones games, and he let it happen; he went with the flow and never got riled up. All in all, was American Gods a bad book? Absolutely not! Was it a great book? Not for me, but I suppose that depends on what you are looking for. Generally, I read for funAmerican Gods was not a fun book. Is Neil Gaiman an incredible author? Hell, yes.

The novel blends DARPA military technology and  genetics with mystical Arabian Djinn powers to produce this intriguing story line dating back to the Queen of  Sheba. Arabian folklore along with biblical history  paved  the way for its climatic ending. The characters were well developed and the mystery as to which one of the six was the other mole was riveting, yet surprising once the traitor was revealed at the novel's end.

There's a magic to this novel that's hard to describe, sort of like the magic of the gods in the story. A lot of the events in this story are obviously fictional, yet I can't shake this subconscious feeling of extreme relevance. There's a lot that isn't explained in this novel, and I imagine that makes this a divisive piece of work. You have to be like the main character, Shadow, and simply accept certain things in order to enjoy this novel. It isn't for everyone, but if you can get into it it'll feel like something you were destined to read. It'll make you reexamine faith, America, and life in general.

         "Lets face it, weve all had days where absolutely nothing is going right.  Alexander is having one of those days too.  From the moment he gets out of bed in the morning, it seems like the whole world is lined up against him.  His brothers get toys in their breakfast cereal but he doesnt.  He has to sit in the middle seat during the carpool ride to school.  His friends all have better lunches than he does.  The day just keeps getting worse as it goes on, and eventually Alexander thinks that the best course of action might be for him to simply chuck it all and move to Australia! I love this book because its so easy to sympathize with Alexander and the situations that hes facing on this one particular day.  For example, anyone who has brothers or sisters knows how hard it can be to share a bathroom!  When you're having a bad day, even something thats normally fun, like going shopping for new sneakers, can quickly descend into arguments or even fistfights!  I imagine that Mrs. Viorst must be a mother or a teacher, because she certainly knows how young men can sometimes act out when things don't go our way.  The book follows Alexander through every heartbreaking moment of his bad day, and the hilarious illustrations by Ray Cruz do an awesome job of making the reader feel sympathetic.  Some of the pictures might seem a little dated since this book is now over forty years old, but I think that even kids raised up with Playstations and iPhones will still be able to relate to them. One of my favorite things about this book is the fact that it doesnt condescend to the reader, even though its a picture book aimed at younger men.  Sometimes youll feel like things aren't going your way, and theres absolutely nothing you can do but keep trying.  The world doesnt revolve around you, after all.  In the end, I actually appreciated the fact that no one rushes in to save Alexander from his bad day because, as his mother says, some days are like that. Even in Australia.",

Open the thick cover of \"Chu's Day\" and read these auspicious words: \"When Chu sneezed, bad things happened.\" Well, that just sets the imagination firing, doesn't it? We follow Chu and his worried parents to a library, a diner and a circus, all of which have allergens a-plenty. Does Chu finally sneeze and, if so, where? I'm afraid I shouldn't say. This book is recommended for kids age 4-8 on the back cover but seems targeted at the lower end of the scale. Gaiman, in the press materials that accompanied it, says this is \"the first book I've ever written for really little kids. Ones who cannot read. Ones who can only just walk. Those ones.\" It's a read-aloud tale that gives the reader license to use dramatic voices and goofy expressions to get the tale across. It's perfectly accompanied by illustrations by Adam Rex, whose tiny panda faces are particularly adorable. And it makes the subtle point -- spelled out on the back cover just to be sure you get it -- that \"even the smallest child can make big things happen.\" Cute. by Tom Knapp, the Rambles. NET guy",

Gaiman is a good writer and the story he weaves is cool, but the main character was a little disconnected. Nothing seemed to phase him, and you never really knew if he was just stupid or had intense emotional trauma in his past. I had trouble putting myself in his position. Otherwise, the book ended in an interesting way. I recommend you hit your local library and check it out or pick it up from the bargain bin when it goes on sale. On a side note, Gaiman's sandman is an awesome series where he really shines. That was the main reason I turned to his writings.",

It's got a lot of action with a little romance of a more down-to-earth flavor to it. The people in it are complex and a lot more realistic than some works of fiction... The main characters are a cop that comes from a cooking background, a shrink that has enough mental problems of her own as well as a woman who may or may not be a psychotic killer or the savior of a small band of a people in a distant village. Plus a cast of interesting supporting characters that are very much alive themselves and could stand on their own just as easily as they help round out peopling the book's plot and pages. I'd say it's on par with another author, Carl Hiaasen... It has similar depth, humor and grit with out being overdone and weighty. As well as a more real world romance that unlike most \"dime store romance novels\" would likely see the characters staying together beyond the story of the one book or series.",

         "Imagine Indiana Jones, (his name is Omaha Dunn here), taking-on 'the perfect storm' in the great Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, in central Arabia. In this desert place, beneath the burning sun, hurricane force winds blow up quickly. One can drown in an ocean of sand and remain interred forever. Add to this mix, the obsession to find a great fabled city, and a civilization lost thousands of years ago, now buried beneath the shifting dunes. Ubar, a rich and fabulous trading center of ancient Arabia, ruled by the Queen of Sheba, once rose out of the desert and then mysteriously vanished back into the sands. References to Ubar in the Koran, the Arabian Nights, and countless Bedouin tales told around desert campfires have captivated the imaginations of explorers and archaeologists. But all searches have been fruitless and the city remained lost. The storm, the search for Ubar and for a source of energy strong enough to fuel the entire earth, are just the basics of this enthralling story. James Rollins' \"Sandstorm\" also contains various subplots, no less exciting than the primary adventure, a terrific cast of characters, fascinating historical and scientific information, a love triangle and enough action, suspense and thrills to keep you reading long into the night. This is one of the most addictive novels I have read in some time. Once I began, I just couldn't put it down. Dr. Safia Al-Maaz, curator of the Arabian wing of the British Museum was abruptly awakened one night by the smell of smoke and the sound of sirens. She looked out her window and saw her wing of the museum in flames, and chaos in the streets. Dressing in panic she ran to the site, a short distance from her flat. The Arabian wing, priceless artifacts, and all the work she had accomplished over a 10-year period, were totally destroyed by a tremendous explosion. Clandestine organizations worldwide were alerted to this event almost before Safia reached the disaster area. And so begins a dangerous, lethal race to discover what caused the explosion, why it happened and what it means. Lady Kara Kensington, Safia's best friend and sponsor to the Arabian gallery, is devastated also. Both women have strong roots in the deserts of Arabia. Painter Crowe, member of a secret American government organization, is tasked with finding the incredibly powerful source of the explosion before anyone else does, and if possible, to contain it. Answers to these questions and many more are to be found in the desert country of Oman and the Rub al-Khali, a forbidden land where evil spirits reign, and where, perhaps, lies the mysterious city of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. Lady Kensintron organizes a small expedition, including Dr. Al-Maaz and Crowe, to travel to Oman to find these answers. However, Kara's expedition is not the only group determined to discover the desert's secrets; other shadowy groups trail the expeditions every move. Again, I was completely riveted. The historic detail is amazing. A great read & highly recommended! JANA",

         "The only thing that maybe redeems this book (or responds to Handler's cryptic note that maybe you did not get the ending yet if you were hoping it would tie up loose ends) is the idea that from the start, readers were warned that this book would not have a happy ending. The End is a meta-commentary on the murkiness of \"good and evil\" and as usual, Snicket borrows (or steals? depends on how you look at it, ha) from the literary greats in his library, most notably The Tempest by Shakespeare and The Odyssey by Homer. Two amazing works that, if you are familiar with them, demonstrate Snicket is working with themes of great depth and significance and ALSO that when held up to other writers who have tackled it before, Snicket fails to deliver. He's toiled away at creating a world where nothing is significant, red herrings abound, and there's no satisfaction at the end of the journey. Such is life. However, this doesn't excuse the extreme melodrama that is so tired by now, the one-sided characters, the endless string of deus ex machinas or the massive amounts of suspension of disbelief required to get through this book. The characters in the book are inflated caricatures of adult fears, arrogance, worries, cynicism, and intellectual atrophy. At the same time the kids are sniveling wimps ever moving towards adulthood. What do they have to look forward to? Life as caricatures! It makes no sense, unless we are meant to mourn the passing of the Beaudelaire's \"innocence\". Snicket stresses that fluffy books with lessons and morals are ridiculous but even Shakespeare wrapped his stories in life-lessons gleaned from life experiences. So what did the Beaudelaires and the readers learn by the end? That you can't trust everyone (or anyone almost), that adults are bad, that animals are good, that life is unfair. Oh well, it's emo for embryos. You can't trust a writer to write a good book even if it's a bestseller smash hit, adults sometimes make bad writers, animals (humans aside) don't read so good for them escaping this drivel and life is proved unfair when you've invested a good amount of time and hope into a writer who fails to deliver at the end of the day. Ah, maybe that's Snicket's answer to his critics: \"Life ain't fair, I'm rich, deal with it.\"",

When her beloved exhibit explodes, she's reminded of everything she ran away from- bombs, terrorists, a fiance. She never dreamed that a ruined exhibit, would force her to return to her home. Accompanied by the exhibit's benefactor, who is also Safia's best friend, they form a rag tag team to find the mysterious phenomenon that caused the exhibit to blow up. Unbeknownst to them, there is another team who wants to uncover the mystery first.

Now stranded on an island with only castaways the Bauldelaires must get use to the islands customs of their new home if they want to stay.  And staying won't be easy with the tricky Count Olaf ,whose disguises has gotten the orphans over there heads at every home they've had, on the loose.  The leader of the island, Ish , is a respected elder among the castaways.  When he recommends something the castaways surely do it.  This is because of his recommended cocoanut milk which is the only supply of water accustomed to the castaways.  The cocoanut milk makes the people drowsy and lazy and they listen better because of it.  I recommend this book to all who have read the other 12 Series of Unfortunate Events books.  If you read this book first you won't understand this book at important parts of it.  This series has become my favorite series and this book is my favorite book in the series.  This book has everything: comedy, action, pregnant guys, large snakes, deadly diseases, sore feet, and what everyone wants in a book books!

There were some good scenes, but Gruber's formula of having three alternating points of view: a diary, a protaganist, and another protaganist, seemed forced this time around. The detective story was contrived and convoluted, and instead of it coming to a climax or being solved, it was all just explained by a minor character (at gunpoint) over four pages of dialogue. Yawn. Maybe it was too subtle for me (Tropic of Night, with it's baby brain-ectomies, was definitely not subtle), or maybe I'm just bored by books that hint at the miracles of Christianity when there's thousands of other interesting religions.",

         "\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\", much like a man with one very long and one extremely short leg walking down the block, had its ups and downs. As a rule, Lemony Snicket writes bad beginnings (pun intended).  Since book nine, the beginnings of these books were as tedious as \"The Little Engine That Could\" (referenced as the most tedious bedtime story ever in \"The End\").  However, this book like the ones that preceded it took flight about half-way through, never to look back.  There were metaphors galore, and many beautifully, disturbingly accurate depictions of how life really is, demonstrated by the absurd actions of characters. Count Olaf's character is taken to a place I never suspected, and I thoroughly enjoyed that.  I also liked that Snicket left many questions unanswered, because that--in truth--is the way the world works.  The way he chose to satisfy his loyal readers was to subtly tie everything together, while leaving a bit to the imagination. I laughed (particularly at the 'roast lamb' bit of CHAPTER FOURTEEN), I cried, and I enjoyed this book.  However, I am glad it is over.  It was great while it lasted, but one more book would have been one too many. \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\" was a great series, and I will always remember how much I enjoyed it.  And, being that this is a review for the last book of the series and not the series of the whole, I have to rate \"The End.\"  I say that \"The End\" is a great end to the series, as is \"The End\" of \"The End\" which can be found at \"The End\" of \"The End\". 8/10",

         "We are used to Serge being on the lose in Florida.  This novel in the series is mainly set in Hollywood.  I knew right then that sometime serial killer and full time lunatic Serge would find plenty of candidates worthy of being dispatched.  He does not disappoint.  The narrator does a wonderful job with all of the voices. Two of my favorite characters (bad guys) are the two brother studio bosses, the Glicks, who fulfill every bad stereotype ever conceived about such movie people.  They are just about equalled in awfulness by the director of the biggest movie shooting at the studio, Ptoemkin. I wondered throughout how Serge would give them their coup de grace.  He outdoes himself.  There is another character who is being betrayed by this bunch and we don't know his relationship to Serge until the end.  He is an aspiring screenwriter who has a screenplay stolen by the brothers. This was a first class narration job so I would highly recommend doing this novel as an audio experience instead of a print one.

         "A vacation isn't a vacation without bringing Serge Storms along. Tim Dorsey's The Big Bamboo is a novel that continues the lively Florida-centric antics of your favorite serial killer, Serge, and his always intoxicated sidekick, Coleman. While Dorsey usually keeps Serge in Florida, in this installment, he makes his way to Hollywood, with the usual hilarious results. Serge has gotten it into his head that Florida needs to retake the movie making crown from Hollywood, and attempts to write a screenplay that will once again make Florida the center of the movie industry. But the screenplay is a work in progress, as Serge continues to revise it to match his adventure, or the novel changes to match Serge's screenplay. I am not sure which. As Serge is writing, and rewriting, his screenplay, he finds time to get himself mixed up with an unscrupulous nursing home owner, Japanese mafia, \"redneck\" mafia, a group of retirees running a scam, his grandfather (not quite as \"eccentric\" as Serge), and a couple of Hollywood movie makers. As with all of Serge's adventures, this one does not lack for characters or laughs. This novel takes Serge out of his precious Florida, and with that, it seems that a little something was missing. And yet, it was an extremely enjoyable read. While most of the people with whom Serge interacts never know quite what to expect, putting him in Hollywood gives Dorsey ample opportunity to raise the bar, adding unique California characters and situations. Further, readers familiar with Serge, know that he can't sit still long. Placing him on an airplane for the trip to California was one of the highlights of the book. You may think that you have had bad flights, but they will pale in comparison to one described in the book. Finally, Dorsey pulls all of the characters together in an excellent climax, one that may require you to reread, as so many things occur, with great effect. Unusual in that the action does not occur exclusively in Florida, The Big Bamboo is a very good addition to the Serge Storms novels.",

Following a scam set forth by his grandfather Sergio, Serge takes off on a frantic run into movieland. In the mix are piles of wanna-be-screenwriters, a massively over budgeted and delayed \"epic\" movie, coked-out studio heads, kidnapped model-turned actress, hitmen, and Dallas who is always searching for the next big party spot. It's crazy and fast paced with a change of scenery. I enjoy all the Serge books of Dorsey but thought several of them fell short of the regular output of this author. I found myself reading a hundred pages at a time on this one and not even realizing it. As the series progresses, Serge's frenetic and imaginative killing is dropping into low single digits per book and that may be a plus for the series. Afterall, is it really right for us to enjoy a book about a psychotic serial killer and a pot junky as the main characters? Overall, I liked the story/scam and even the trip to Hollywood for Serge & Coleman and I read it much faster than I expected to. It's a welcome addition to the series and I can't wait for more.",

         "This incredibly original work by Gaiman had me hanging on for the whole ride. The basic premise is that every \"believer\" in America has brought with them their corresponding god. But as belief in the power of technology, the promises of science, and the ecstasy of sexuality have grown, the belief in classical deities has waned. As a result, these Gods have been left to fend for themselves ... scraping up whatever worship (and pocket cash) they can. But their frustration is growing, and the book charts the rise of conflict between these groups through the perspective of an unlikely narrator. (I will leave the rest to the reader's discovery) Overall, I loved the ways in which Gaiman was able to enflesh some of the traditional characteristics of the deities ... and yet at the same time, this was one of the significant shortcomings if the book. Just like the pantheon of Greek gods, the gods of Gaiman's world are flawed ... often tragically and dangerously so. But the one link that might have helped to bridge this would have been the role of the respective gods' believers in shaping the tragic flaws that become evident. Indeed, given the (narrative) possibility if multiple versions of each god being present in different locations and with different bodies of believers, I think Gaiman missed the chance to develop these differences (and perhaps even arrange meetings) between the deities of different sects within the same belief system. As it stands, Gaiman's book functions as a helpful critique, both of the ultimate ends of sacrifice-only-loving deities, as well as of the (sometimes unspoken) \"eternal\" promises of technology, medical science, entertainment, and consumerism. He does a magnificent job of paralleling our modern day \"worship\" of these ends with the millennia-old worship of deities. There was tremendous promise for me in the full narrative arc of Shadow, but it left me just a little unsatisfied in the end. Admittedly, however, this may be due in part to my own inability to grasp the full significance of the events in the last third of the book. In any event, the quality of the storytelling and the originality of the story makes me want to go back and see what I might have missed. I look forward, with pleasure, to rereading it ... and this itself might be the best compliment I can pay to this fascinating book.",

         5,
         "Having apparently snuffed all the important strange and evil characters in Florida, Serge and his remarkably resurrected sidekick, Coleman, head to Hollywood. But of course, it's not that simple. It's never that simple. They need motivation and they get it from Serge's Grampa, Sergio. You remember him from Cadillac Beach, Dorsey's prequel. Let's see, two Pretzel heads, Mark and Ford, from Zanesville Ohio, work their way to Holly-land and wind up as prop men for a less-than-ethical movie studio run by the brothers Glick and owned by Japanese mafia of sorts. Of course, everybody, from street vendors to movie grips to tourists from Minnesota, have scripts to sell. Including Ford. Of course, the Glick brothers scam Ford out of his. While all this is going on, the Glick brothers are trying to convince their artistic director, Potemkin, to finish his epic, All That Glitters. Then their newly discovered leading lady, Ally Street, is abducted and supposedly murdered. Is there money, lotsa money, involved? Is there gonna be mayhem? Is there gonna be a convoluted plot? Are there bad guys, really bad guys? How about The Tat and The Fullback, and bunches of other snuffable villains in big, black cars! Are our boys involved? Whaddaya think! I was a little leery of Dorsey taking on the Hollywood scene. After all, there should be enough Hollywood - and Disneyland - in Florida to provide fodder for another dozen Serge books. But, I have a sneaking feeling that Dorsey has spent a bunch of time \"out there,\" probably being wined and dined far too many times over movie rights to his first book, Torpedo Juice. And after Dorsey's seventh book, where he, Dorsey, took over the litany of geographical or locational minutae that Serge always did, I worried that he would do the same here. But Serge is back to his old mind-dump routine - great long lists of movies that were filmed in Florida, or those that were filmed in other places but attributed to Florida, or locations and descriptions of actors' abodes, or even the great detail of where and how Janice Joplin died - \"She hit face-first right where you're standing. October third, twenty-six years ago.\" Fantastic! These are the things that complete Serge's loveable psychopathic character. Thank God he's off his lithium for a while! Even Serge's offing of the bad guys is true Hollywood! Car chases, collapsing buildings, even the unparting of the Red Sea! Still, I think even Serge is losing a half-step after all these years. I mean, he ruined a perfect assassination of a bad guy by not having the right sized nails! I mean, that wouldn't have happened to the Serge of old, now would it? And even Serge is getting more than a little annoyed at Coleman who does nothing but drugs and booze, ordering him off the island (think Survivor). Oh, and mystery readers who love to read the last chapter first to find out who did it - go ahead! It ain't gonna help! And I'm sure it will make Serge and Dorsey's day! Tim, great job! Now bring Serge back to Florida! Please! We need him here!",

He runs into a mysterious stranger named Mr. Wednesday, who recruits him to help in a sort of quest involving some of America's most unusual immigrants. The story jumps back to some earlier periods in history, giving the reader more insight to how America became the America we know now. Highly recommended - it's hard to put down.",

There wasn't a believable moment in the whole book, but that didn't take away from the realism which cropped up. I try not to give away the story, but if you can keep an open mind and not expect nice sweet characters who are endearing then the rawness which develops isn't too much of a shock. I recommend this to anyone looking for something different and a book which isn't a part of a series and can be enjoyed for the moment you are reading it.",
